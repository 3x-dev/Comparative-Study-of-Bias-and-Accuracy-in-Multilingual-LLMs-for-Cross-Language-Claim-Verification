biz Avrupalılardan 42 dolar daha fazla para veriyoruz doğalgaza,mostly false,tr,We pay 42 dollars more for natural gas than Europeans.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We pay 42 dollars more for natural gas than Europeans,"" we need to consider several factors, including the time frame, the specific countries being compared, and the units of measurement (e.g., per cubic meter, per MMBtu, etc.).

1. **Time Frame**: Natural gas prices fluctuate over time due to market conditions, geopolitical events, and seasonal demand. The claim might be accurate at a specific point in time but not universally true.

2. **Countries**: Europe is not a single market; different countries within Europe have different natural gas prices. For example, prices in Germany might differ from those in Spain or the UK.

3. **Units of Measurement**: Natural gas prices can be quoted in various units such as per cubic meter, per MMBtu (Million British Thermal Units), or per therm. The claim needs to specify the unit to be meaningful.

4. **Data Sources**: Reliable data sources such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), Eurostat, or national energy departments should be consulted to verify the claim.

Given these considerations, without specific details on the time frame, countries, and units of measurement, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general trends, natural gas prices in the U.S. have historically been lower than in many European countries due to factors like domestic production and market dynamics.

Therefore, the claim ""We pay 42 dollars more for natural gas than Europeans"" is likely inaccurate.

"There are no problems in the religious sphere in Azerbaijan, religious freedom is fully ensured",mostly false,az,"There are no problems in the religious sphere in Azerbaijan, religious freedom is fully ensured.","To evaluate the claim that ""There are no problems in the religious sphere in Azerbaijan, religious freedom is fully ensured,"" we need to consider various sources and reports on religious freedom in the country.

1. **Constitutional and Legal Framework**: Azerbaijan's constitution guarantees religious freedom, and the country is officially secular. However, the government has significant control over religious practices and institutions.

2. **Government Control and Restrictions**: Reports from organizations like Human Rights Watch and the U.S. Department of State indicate that the Azerbaijani government imposes restrictions on religious groups. For example, all religious communities must register with the government, and unregistered religious activity is illegal. There are also reports of harassment and detention of religious activists and leaders.

3. **Minority Religions**: While the majority of Azerbaijan's population is Muslim, there are also Christian, Jewish, and other religious minorities. These groups often face difficulties, including bureaucratic hurdles in registration and limitations on their religious activities.

4. **International Assessments**: The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has noted concerns about religious freedom in Azerbaijan, including government interference in religious practices and the detention of individuals for their religious beliefs.

Given these points, while there is a framework for religious freedom in Azerbaijan, significant issues and restrictions exist, particularly concerning government control and the treatment of minority religious groups.

"2023 senesine yaklaşırken Türkiye, dünyanın en büyük 10 ekonomisi olması gibi bir hedef koymuştuk. Bugünlerde ilk 20’den dışarı çıkma tehlikesiyle karşı karşıyayız.",mostly false,tr,"As we approached the year 2023, we had set a goal for Turkey to become one of the world's top 10 economies. Nowadays, we are facing the danger of falling out of the top 20.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate Turkey's economic standing and its goals.

1. **Goal to Become a Top 10 Economy by 2023**: Turkey has indeed set ambitious economic goals in the past, including aiming to become one of the world's top 10 economies by 2023. This goal was part of the Vision 2023 plan, which was announced by the Turkish government.

2. **Current Economic Standing**: As of the latest available data, Turkey is not in the top 10 economies globally. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank rankings, Turkey's economy is typically ranked around the 19th to 21st largest in terms of nominal GDP.

3. **Risk of Falling Out of the Top 20**: Given the economic challenges Turkey has faced, including high inflation, currency devaluation, and political instability, there is a legitimate concern that Turkey could fall out of the top 20 economies. However, as of the most recent data, Turkey is still within the top 20.

Based on this information:

- The goal to become a top 10 economy by 2023 is accurate.
- Turkey is currently not in the top 10 and is facing economic challenges.
- The risk of falling out of the top 20 is a concern but has not yet materialized.

Türkiye son 10 yılda 120 milyar doların üzerinde gıdası için tarım ürünü ithal etti.,half true,tr,Turkey has imported over 120 billion dollars' worth of agricultural products for food in the last 10 years.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey has imported over 120 billion dollars' worth of agricultural products for food in the last 10 years,"" we need to look at reliable data sources such as trade statistics from Turkish government reports, international trade databases, or reputable economic research organizations.

As of my last update in 2021, Turkey is known to be a significant importer of agricultural products, but it is also a major exporter. The exact figures can vary based on the source and the specific time frame considered. However, without access to the most recent and specific data, it is challenging to confirm the exact amount.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, the claim seems plausible but requires verification from up-to-date and authoritative sources.

ABD’de 1 ayda 500 bin kişi iş kaybetti krizde. Türkiye’de istihdamımızda en ufak bir azalma olmadı.,mostly false,tr,"In the USA, 500 thousand people lost their jobs in one month during the crisis. In Turkey, there was not the slightest decrease in our employment.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and the specific time period being referenced. The statement compares job losses in the USA to employment stability in Turkey during a crisis, but it does not specify which crisis or time period.

1. **USA Job Losses**: The claim states that 500 thousand people lost their jobs in one month in the USA during a crisis. This is plausible during significant economic downturns, such as the 2008 financial crisis or the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the USA saw millions of job losses in a short period.

2. **Turkey Employment Stability**: The claim asserts that there was no decrease in employment in Turkey during the same crisis. This is a strong statement and would require specific data to verify. Economic crises often have global impacts, and it is unusual for any country to experience no employment changes during such times.

Given the lack of specific details about the crisis and the time period, and considering the general economic trends during major global crises, it is unlikely that Turkey experienced no decrease in employment while the USA saw significant job losses.

"Türkiye'de üreticiler iki Trakya büyüklüğündeki alanı geçinemediği, zarar ettiği için ekmiyor.",mostly true,tr,"In Turkey, producers are not planting an area twice the size of Thrace because they cannot make a living and are incurring losses.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Geographical Reference**: Thrace is a region in southeastern Europe, which includes parts of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. The Turkish part of Thrace is relatively small compared to the entire country.

2. **Agricultural Context in Turkey**: There have been reports and data indicating that some farmers in Turkey are facing economic difficulties, which could lead to reduced planting activities. Factors such as rising costs, low market prices, and economic instability can contribute to this situation.

3. **Specificity of the Claim**: The claim states that producers are not planting an area ""twice the size of Thrace."" This is a specific and measurable assertion. However, without concrete data on the exact area of land not being planted and a direct comparison to the size of Thrace, it is challenging to verify this precisely.

4. **Economic Viability**: The claim mentions that producers cannot make a living and are incurring losses. This is a plausible scenario given the economic challenges faced by farmers globally, including in Turkey.

Given the information available, the claim seems to have a basis in reality but may lack precise data to fully substantiate the specific comparison to ""twice the size of Thrace.""

AK Parti'nin iktidara geldiği 2002'den sonra çocuklara ilişkin devlet eliyle ortaya çıkan yaşam hakkı ihlallerinde ciddi bir artış var,half true,tr,"Since the AK Party came to power in 2002, there has been a significant increase in state-related violations of children's right to life.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Since the AK Party came to power in 2002, there has been a significant increase in state-related violations of children's right to life,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context and Data**: The AK Party (Justice and Development Party) has been in power in Turkey since 2002. To evaluate the claim, we would need access to reliable data on children's right to life violations before and after 2002. This includes reports from human rights organizations, government records, and independent studies.

2. **Sources and Reports**: Various human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and local Turkish human rights groups, may have documented instances of state-related violations of children's rights. These reports would provide evidence to support or refute the claim.

3. **Nature of Violations**: The term ""state-related violations"" can encompass a range of issues, including police violence, military actions, neglect in state institutions, and other forms of state negligence or abuse. Understanding the specific nature and context of these violations is crucial.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the frequency and severity of such violations before and after 2002 would help in assessing whether there has been a significant increase.

Given the complexity and the need for detailed and specific data, a definitive answer requires thorough research. However, based on general knowledge and reports from human rights organizations, there have been documented concerns about human rights in Turkey, including issues affecting children, during the AK Party's tenure.

"Helikopterini, tankını ve savunma sanayiinin yüzde 75’ni yapan ülke olduk",mostly false,tr,"We have become a country that produces 75% of its helicopters, tanks, and defense industry.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""We have become a country that produces 75% of its helicopters, tanks, and defense industry,"" we need to consider the context and available data on the country's defense production capabilities.

1. **Defense Industry Self-Sufficiency**: Many countries aim for self-sufficiency in defense production, but achieving a 75% self-sufficiency rate is significant and would typically be well-documented.

2. **Country-Specific Data**: The claim does not specify which country is being referred to. Different countries have varying levels of self-sufficiency in defense production. For example, countries like the United States, Russia, and China have substantial domestic defense industries, but the exact percentage of self-produced equipment can vary.

3. **Verification**: To verify this claim, one would need access to specific data from defense industry reports, government publications, or credible defense analysis sources that provide detailed statistics on the production of helicopters, tanks, and other defense equipment.

Given the lack of specific context and data in the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it without further information. However, based on general knowledge, achieving 75% self-sufficiency in such a broad range of defense equipment is ambitious and not commonly reported for most countries.

MEB bütçesi 2002'ye göre 8 kat artarak 62 milyar liraya yükseldi.,mostly false,tr,"The Ministry of Education's budget increased eightfold compared to 2002, reaching 62 billion liras.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Ministry of Education's budget increased eightfold compared to 2002, reaching 62 billion liras,"" we need to verify two key pieces of information:

1. The budget of the Ministry of Education in 2002.
2. The current budget of the Ministry of Education, which is claimed to be 62 billion liras.

Let's assume the following data for the sake of analysis:

- In 2002, the Ministry of Education's budget was 7.75 billion liras.
- The current budget is indeed 62 billion liras.

To check if the budget increased eightfold, we perform the following calculation:

\[ 7.75 \text{ billion liras} \times 8 = 62 \text{ billion liras} \]

If the above calculation holds true, then the claim is accurate. However, if the initial budget in 2002 or the current budget is different, the claim's accuracy would change accordingly.

Given the provided data:

\[ 7.75 \text{ billion liras} \times 8 = 62 \text{ billion liras} \]

This calculation is correct, so the claim is accurate.

1. **Source Verification**: Is there a credible source or official report that confirms the savings of 200 million AZN due to the abolition of unfounded and false appointments?
2. **Context and Evidence**: Are there specific examples or data that support the claim? For instance, details on the number of appointments abolished and the financial impact of each.
3. **Expert Analysis**: Have experts or analysts in the field corroborated the claim?

Without access to specific data or credible sources to verify the claim, it is challenging to definitively assess its truthfulness. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a reliable authority and there is no contradictory evidence, we might lean towards a certain level of truth.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

This figure is followed by the data from 2018. In short, after the transition to the Presidential system in Turkey, inflation has started to break records consecutively.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **12-month average inflation rate for February over the last 10 years**: We need to check the inflation data for each February from 2013 to 2023.
2. **Comparison of the 12-month average inflation rate since 2019**: We need to confirm if the 12-month average inflation rate for February 2023 is indeed the highest since 2019.
3. **Data from 2018**: We need to verify if the 12-month average inflation rate for February 2018 is the second highest in the last 10 years.
4. **Impact of the Presidential system**: We need to check if there is a noticeable trend of increasing inflation rates after the transition to the Presidential system in Turkey, which occurred in 2018.

Without access to the specific inflation data for each February from 2013 to 2023, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge and trends, we can make an educated assessment.

1. **12-month average inflation rate for February over the last 10 years**: Inflation in Turkey has been notably high in recent years, particularly after 2018.
2. **Comparison of the 12-month average inflation rate since 2019**: It is plausible that the 12-month average inflation rate for February 2023 is the highest since 2019, given the economic challenges Turkey has faced.
3. **Data from 2018**: 2018 was a year of significant economic turmoil in Turkey, with high inflation rates.
4. **Impact of the Presidential system**: There has been a trend of increasing inflation rates after the transition to the Presidential system in 2018.

Given these points, the claim appears to be largely accurate but may lack some specific details or context.

Şimdi büyüme 3,1.",mostly false,tr,"At the end of 2002, the Turkish economy had transitioned with an economic growth performance of 6.9%. Now, the growth is 3.1%.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The economic growth performance of Turkey at the end of 2002.
2. The current economic growth rate of Turkey.

1. According to historical economic data, Turkey's GDP growth rate in 2002 was indeed around 6.9%. This was a period of recovery following a severe financial crisis in 2001.

2. The current economic growth rate of Turkey can vary depending on the specific time frame being referenced. As of the latest available data in 2023, Turkey's GDP growth rate has fluctuated due to various economic challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic factors. However, a growth rate of around 3.1% is plausible for recent years.

Given that both parts of the claim are generally accurate based on available data, the claim can be considered mostly true.

1998 yılındaki 8 yıllık zorunlu eğitimin ardından çocuk gelin sayısında azalma olmuştur...,mostly true,tr,"After the 8-year compulsory education in 1998, there has been a decrease in the number of child brides...","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""After the 8-year compulsory education in 1998, there has been a decrease in the number of child brides,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: In many countries, extending compulsory education has been associated with various social benefits, including a reduction in child marriage rates. This is because keeping children, especially girls, in school longer can delay marriage and childbearing.

2. **Data and Studies**: Empirical data and studies would be necessary to confirm this trend. For instance, reports from organizations like UNICEF, UNESCO, or national statistics could provide evidence on changes in child marriage rates following the implementation of extended compulsory education.

3. **Geographical Specificity**: The claim does not specify a country or region. The impact of compulsory education on child marriage rates can vary significantly depending on local cultural, economic, and legal contexts.

4. **Time Frame**: The claim refers to a period starting in 1998. Trends over such a long period can be influenced by numerous factors beyond just education policies, including economic development, legal reforms, and social campaigns against child marriage.

Given these considerations, if there is substantial evidence from credible sources indicating a correlation between extended compulsory education and a decrease in child marriage rates in the relevant context, the claim could be considered accurate. However, without specific data or studies to reference, the claim remains somewhat generalized.

1. **Bursa's Rank in Population**: Bursa is indeed the 4th largest city in Turkey by population.
2. **Bursa's Rank in Exports**: Bursa is a significant contributor to Turkey's exports, often ranking high, typically second after Istanbul.
3. **Export Value**: The claim states Bursa's exports are valued at 11.6 billion dollars. This figure can fluctuate, but Bursa is known for its strong export performance, particularly in the automotive and textile sectors.
4. **Investment vs. Tax Contribution**: The claim that Bursa does not receive its fair share of investments relative to the taxes it contributes is more subjective and would require detailed financial data and analysis of government spending and investment patterns.

Given the available information:

- Bursa is the 4th largest city by population.
- Bursa ranks 2nd in exports, often with figures around the stated amount.
- The statement about investment relative to tax contribution is harder to quantify without specific data but is a common sentiment in regional economic discussions.

Based on these points, the claim appears to be largely accurate but includes a subjective element regarding investment fairness.

Koskoca İngiliz Kraliyeti 126 milyon lirayla idare ediliyor. Bizim Cumhurbaşkanının yanında Kraliçe Elizabeth fakir kalıyor.,half true,tr,"The entire British monarchy is managed with 126 million liras. Compared to our President, Queen Elizabeth seems poor.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare the financial management of the British monarchy with the expenses associated with the President of another country, presumably Turkey, given the use of ""liras.""

1. **British Monarchy's Budget**: The British monarchy's finances are primarily managed through the Sovereign Grant, which is a percentage of the profits from the Crown Estate. For the financial year 2020-2021, the Sovereign Grant was £85.9 million. Converting this to Turkish liras (using an approximate exchange rate of 1 GBP = 20 TRY), it would be around 1.72 billion TRY, not 126 million liras.

2. **Comparison with Turkish President**: The claim implies that the Turkish President's budget is significantly higher. The Turkish Presidential budget for 2021 was reported to be around 4.39 billion TRY.

Given these points:
- The British monarchy's budget is significantly higher than 126 million liras.
- The Turkish President's budget is indeed higher than the British monarchy's budget.

Therefore, the claim that the British monarchy is managed with 126 million liras is incorrect, but the implication that the Turkish President's budget is higher than the British monarchy's budget is correct.

OECD ülkeleri içinde milli gelire oranla en yüksek asgari ücret Türkiye’de.,mostly true,tr,"Among OECD countries, Turkey has the highest minimum wage relative to national income.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Among OECD countries, Turkey has the highest minimum wage relative to national income,"" we need to examine the most recent data from the OECD regarding minimum wages and national income (often measured as GDP per capita).

1. **OECD Data on Minimum Wages**: The OECD regularly publishes data on minimum wages across its member countries. This data is often expressed in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) to account for differences in cost of living.

2. **Relative to National Income**: The claim specifies that the comparison is relative to national income. This means we need to look at the ratio of the minimum wage to the national income (GDP per capita).

3. **Recent Reports and Rankings**: According to recent OECD reports, countries like Luxembourg, Australia, and France often have high minimum wages when adjusted for PPP. However, Turkey has also been noted for having a relatively high minimum wage compared to its GDP per capita.

4. **Verification**: As of the latest available data, Turkey does have a high minimum wage relative to its GDP per capita, but it is not necessarily the highest among all OECD countries. Other countries may have higher ratios depending on the specific metrics and time frame considered.

Given this context, the claim that Turkey has the highest minimum wage relative to national income among OECD countries is not entirely accurate.

In many electoral systems, political parties are often granted free airtime based on certain criteria, such as the number of candidates they field or the percentage of votes they received in previous elections. However, the exact requirements can vary significantly from one country to another.

Without specific information about the electoral laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdiction, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the jurisdiction in question has a rule that grants free airtime to parties that field a certain number of candidates across a specified number of districts, then the claim could be evaluated based on those criteria.

Given the lack of specific information about the jurisdiction's rules, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be to acknowledge the uncertainty.

The AK Party, also known as the Justice and Development Party, came to power in Turkey in November 2002. Therefore, we need to find reliable sources or records that indicate the number of embassies in Ankara around that time and compare it to the most recent data available.

1. **Historical Data (2002):** According to various sources, including historical records and diplomatic directories, there were approximately 84 embassies in Ankara around the time the AK Party came to power in 2002.

Public opinion can vary by country, region, and over time, so it's important to reference a credible and recent source.

For instance, the Eurobarometer survey, conducted by the European Commission, regularly measures public opinion across EU member states. If the latest Eurobarometer survey indicates that approximately 55% of respondents across the EU view the EU positively, then the claim would be accurate.

However, if the percentage is significantly different, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly. Without access to the most recent data at this moment, I cannot definitively verify the exact percentage.

Potato prices are rising, potato imports are being made. Meat prices are rising, meat imports are being made. Barley prices are rising, barley imports are being made.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the specific actions taken by the AKP (Justice and Development Party) in Turkey over the past two years regarding food price increases and imports. 

1. **Potato Prices and Imports**: There have been instances where Turkey has resorted to importing potatoes when domestic prices surged. For example, in 2019, Turkey imported potatoes from countries like Syria to stabilize prices.

2. **Meat Prices and Imports**: Turkey has a history of importing meat to control domestic prices. For instance, in recent years, Turkey has imported livestock and meat from countries like Brazil and France to address price hikes and supply shortages.

3. **Barley Prices and Imports**: Turkey has also imported barley to manage domestic price increases. The country has sourced barley from various countries to ensure sufficient supply and stabilize prices.

Given these points, the claim that the AKP resorts to imports whenever the price of a food item increases is generally supported by evidence. However, the frequency and consistency of these actions over the past two years specifically may vary, and there could be other measures taken alongside imports.

YURTKUR, also known as the General Directorate of Higher Education Credit and Hostels Institution in Turkey, has indeed undergone significant expansions in its student housing capacity over various periods. However, without specific data or a clear timeframe, it is challenging to definitively confirm the exact numbers stated in the claim.

One such source is the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" report, which annually ranks countries on the ease of doing business and highlights top reformers. If the country in question has been listed among the top 10 reformers in the most recent report, the claim would be accurate.

However, without specific data or the name of the country, it is challenging to verify this claim definitively. Generally, only a few countries are recognized as top reformers each year, and this status can change annually based on the reforms implemented.

Given the lack of specific information and the variability of such rankings, the claim cannot be fully verified or dismissed without additional context.

The claims of the majority who appealed to the European Court were not accepted,mostly false,az,The claims of the majority who appealed to the European Court were not accepted.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The claims of the majority who appealed to the European Court were not accepted,"" we need to consider the context and the specific data regarding the acceptance rate of appeals to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

The ECHR receives a large number of applications each year, but only a small percentage of these are declared admissible and proceed to a full judgment. The majority of applications are either declared inadmissible or struck out of the list of cases. This means that, statistically, most claims are not accepted for a full hearing.

Given this general trend, the claim that ""The claims of the majority who appealed to the European Court were not accepted"" aligns with the known data about the ECHR's case processing.

Azerbaijan experienced significant GDP growth in the mid-2000s, primarily due to the development of its oil and gas sector. For instance, in 2006, Azerbaijan's GDP growth rate was exceptionally high, reaching around 34.5%. However, this rapid growth was not sustained over the entire period since 2004. Other countries have also experienced high GDP growth rates during this time, such as China and India, which have consistently shown strong economic performance.

Given that Azerbaijan had some of the highest GDP growth rates in specific years but did not consistently maintain the highest growth rates over the entire period since 2004, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Müsəlman ölkəsi olduğu üçün Türkiyəni Avropa İttifaqına qəbul etmirlər,half true,az,They do not accept Turkey into the European Union because it is a Muslim country.,"The claim that ""They do not accept Turkey into the European Union because it is a Muslim country"" is an oversimplification and does not capture the full complexity of the situation. The European Union's decision-making process regarding Turkey's membership involves multiple factors, including political, economic, human rights, and governance issues.

Turkey's EU accession talks have been ongoing for many years, and several key issues have been cited as reasons for the slow progress or stalling of negotiations. These include concerns about human rights, freedom of the press, the rule of law, and the political situation in Turkey. Additionally, there are economic considerations and the need for Turkey to align more closely with EU standards and regulations.

While cultural and religious differences may play a role in the broader public and political discourse, it is not accurate to say that Turkey's Muslim identity is the sole or primary reason for its non-acceptance into the EU. The situation is multifaceted and involves a range of criteria that Turkey needs to meet to be considered for membership.

1. The total number of university students.
2. The number of students who can benefit from state dormitories.

If the total number of university students is indeed more than 7 million and only 10% of them can benefit from state dormitories, then the number of students benefiting from state dormitories would be around 700,000.

Bütün dünyada doların değer kazanması sonrasında ulusal para birimlerinde benzer bir trend yaşanıyor.,mostly false,tr,"After the appreciation of the dollar worldwide, a similar trend is being experienced in national currencies.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the relationship between the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the behavior of other national currencies. 

When the U.S. dollar appreciates, it generally means that the dollar is gaining value relative to other currencies. This typically results in other currencies depreciating relative to the dollar. Therefore, if the dollar is appreciating, it is unlikely that other national currencies are experiencing a similar trend of appreciation at the same time. Instead, they would more likely be depreciating.

Given this understanding, the claim that ""a similar trend is being experienced in national currencies"" when the dollar appreciates is not accurate.

1. The total export of goods in May.
2. Historical export figures for May in previous years.
3. Whether the current May's export figures indeed surpass all previous May figures.

If the total export of goods in May is confirmed to be higher than any other May in the Republic's history, the claim would be 'True'. If it is slightly higher but not significantly, it might be 'Mostly True'. If it is comparable but not definitively the highest, it could be 'Half True'. If it is lower than some previous May figures, it would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

1. **Historical Electricity Prices**: 
   - In the early 1990s, the average retail price of electricity in the United States was indeed around 3 to 4 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for residential customers. This can be verified through historical data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

2. **Current Electricity Prices**:
   - As of recent years, the average retail price of electricity in the United States has risen to approximately 13 to 14 cents per kWh for residential customers. This is also supported by data from the EIA.

3. **Marketization of Electricity**:
   - The marketization of electricity refers to the deregulation and restructuring of the electricity market, which began in the 1990s. This process aimed to introduce competition and reduce prices. However, the actual impact on prices has been mixed, with some regions experiencing price increases due to various factors, including infrastructure costs, fuel prices, and regulatory changes.

Given this information, the claim that the price of electricity was 3 cents at the beginning of the 1990s and has risen to 14 cents as a result of marketization is mostly accurate in terms of the price change. However, attributing the entire price increase solely to marketization oversimplifies the issue, as other factors have also contributed to the rise in electricity prices.

An election threshold is the minimum share of the vote which a political party requires to secure any representation in a legislature. These thresholds vary by country and can range from as low as 1% to as high as 10%.

Upon investigation, it is found that Turkey has a 10% election threshold for parties to enter its national parliament. This is one of the highest thresholds in the world and is a significant example that directly contradicts the claim.

Therefore, the claim ""There is no 10% election threshold anywhere in the world"" is incorrect.

1. **Data Source**: Verify the source of the data. Is it from a reliable and recent survey or government report?
2. **Economic Context**: Understand the economic context of the region in question. Is it plausible for such a large number of people to have an income below 326 liras?
3. **Population Statistics**: Compare the figure to the total population of the region. Does 11.5 million represent a significant portion of the population?

1. **Number of Refugees to Europe**: According to various reports from organizations like the UNHCR, the number of refugees and migrants arriving in Europe has fluctuated significantly over the years. For instance, during the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015, over a million refugees arrived in Europe. However, in recent years, the numbers have generally been lower, often well below 500,000 annually.

2. **Role of Turkey**: Turkey has been a significant transit country for refugees, particularly those from Syria, Afghanistan, and other conflict zones. The EU-Turkey deal in 2016 aimed to reduce the flow of refugees through Turkey to Europe. While Turkey remains a major route, the proportion of refugees passing through Turkey can vary.

Given these points, the claim that ""Every year, there are 500,000 refugees going to Europe, and 50% of them go through Turkey"" seems to be an oversimplification and not entirely accurate based on recent data trends.

**Evaluation**:
- The number of refugees going to Europe annually is not consistently 500,000.
- While Turkey is a significant route, the claim that exactly 50% of refugees go through Turkey is not consistently supported by data.

This involves checking the per capita national income and growth rate before and after the coup.

1. **Per Capita National Income**: The claim states that the per capita national income fell from 583 dollars to 194 dollars. This is a significant drop and would need to be corroborated by historical economic data from reliable sources.

2. **Growth Rate**: The claim also states that the growth rate dropped from 3 percent to around 1.5 percent. This change in growth rate would similarly need to be verified against historical economic records.

Without access to specific historical economic data for the country in question and the period around the coup of May 27, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, given the significant changes mentioned, such drastic economic impacts would likely be well-documented if accurate.

1. **Source of the Claim**: Identify who is making the claim and their credibility.
2. **Employment Data**: Verify the employment statistics from reliable sources such as government labor departments, independent economic research organizations, or international bodies like the International Labour Organization (ILO).
3. **Time Frame**: Ensure the time frame mentioned (last 7 years) aligns with the data available.
4. **Context**: Understand the broader economic context, including population growth, economic conditions, and other factors that might influence employment numbers.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made by a credible government official and there is supporting data from reliable sources, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific data in this scenario, we can only hypothesize based on general trends and typical economic growth patterns. If the claim aligns with known economic reports and trends, it might be considered 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If it significantly deviates from known data, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

**Hypothetical Analysis**:
- If the country has seen significant economic growth and job creation initiatives, the claim could be 'Mostly True'.
- If the job creation numbers are inflated or not supported by independent data, it could be 'Mostly False'.

Türkiye her yıl 50 milyar faiz gideri ödüyor.,mostly true,tr,Turkey pays 50 billion in interest expenses every year.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey pays 50 billion in interest expenses every year,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable financial data available for Turkey's interest expenses.

1. **Official Government Reports**: The Turkish Treasury and Finance Ministry publishes detailed reports on the country's budget, including interest expenses. These reports are the most authoritative source for such information.

2. **International Financial Institutions**: Organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank also provide data on Turkey's financial situation, including interest payments.

3. **Recent News and Analysis**: Financial news outlets and economic analysis reports can provide updated figures and context.

As of the latest available data, Turkey's interest expenses have varied over the years due to changes in debt levels, interest rates, and economic conditions. For instance, in recent years, Turkey's annual interest expenses have been reported in the range of tens of billions of Turkish lira. Converting this to USD can vary significantly based on the exchange rate at the time.

Given the complexity and variability of financial data, if the claim is referring to Turkish lira, it might be more accurate. However, if it is referring to USD, it would require a specific exchange rate and context to verify.

Based on the most recent data and typical ranges reported, the claim that Turkey pays 50 billion in interest expenses every year is likely an approximation and could be considered somewhat accurate but not precise.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified data, then the statement would be 'True'. If the data shows a decrease that is close to but not exactly fifty percent, the statement could be 'Mostly True'. If the decrease is around half but not precisely, it could be 'Half True'. If the decrease is significantly less or more than fifty percent, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Buzağı ölümleri ülkemizde yüzde 15 seviyesindedir. Her yıl yaklaşık 500 bin buzağı ölmektedir. Buzağı ölümlerini durdurduğumuzda canlı hayvan ithalatının da kendiliğinden önüne geçilmiş olacak.,mostly true,tr,"Calf mortality in our country is at the level of 15 percent. Approximately 500,000 calves die each year. When we stop calf deaths, the importation of live animals will also be automatically prevented.","To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components and assess each part:

1. **Calf Mortality Rate**: The claim states that calf mortality in the country is at 15 percent. This figure can vary significantly depending on the country, region, and specific farming practices. Without specific data from the country in question, it's challenging to verify this exact percentage. However, a 15 percent mortality rate is within the range of what might be seen in some regions, though it is on the higher end.

2. **Number of Calf Deaths**: The claim mentions that approximately 500,000 calves die each year. This number would depend on the total calf population in the country. If the total calf population is around 3.33 million (since 15% of 3.33 million is approximately 500,000), this figure could be plausible. Again, without specific data, it's hard to confirm the exact number.

3. **Impact on Live Animal Importation**: The claim suggests that stopping calf deaths would automatically prevent the importation of live animals. This is a more complex issue. While reducing calf mortality could increase the domestic supply of cattle, the need for live animal imports also depends on other factors such as domestic demand, production costs, trade policies, and market preferences. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that stopping calf deaths would completely eliminate the need for live animal imports.

Given the information available and the complexity of the issues involved, the claim has some elements of truth but also makes assumptions that may not hold in all circumstances.

1. **Historical Context**: The claim states that the per capita national income in the TRNC used to be roughly one-tenth of a certain benchmark.
2. **Current Context**: The claim states that the per capita national income in the TRNC has now reached half of that benchmark.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the benchmark is the per capita national income of the Republic of Cyprus, we can look at general trends and available data:

- Historically, the TRNC has had a significantly lower per capita income compared to the Republic of Cyprus.
- Recent economic reports and data would need to be consulted to see if the TRNC's per capita income has indeed reached half of the Republic of Cyprus's per capita income.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, but acknowledging the general economic trends and improvements in the TRNC's economy, the claim could be considered plausible but not definitively verifiable without concrete figures.

Sera gazının azaltımında pek çok ülkeden daha başarılı konumdayız.,false,tr,We are in a more successful position than many countries in reducing greenhouse gases.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are in a more successful position than many countries in reducing greenhouse gases,"" we need to consider several factors, including the specific country being referred to, the metrics used to measure success, and the context of greenhouse gas reduction efforts globally.

1. **Country-Specific Context**: The success in reducing greenhouse gases can vary significantly from one country to another. For instance, countries in the European Union have generally made substantial progress in reducing emissions, while other countries may lag behind.

2. **Metrics for Success**: Success can be measured in absolute terms (total reduction in emissions) or relative terms (percentage reduction relative to a baseline year). It can also be measured per capita or in terms of emissions intensity (emissions per unit of GDP).

3. **Global Context**: Some countries have historically high emissions but have made significant recent reductions (e.g., the United States), while others have lower historical emissions but are increasing their emissions due to economic growth (e.g., some developing countries).

Given these considerations, without specific details about the country in question and the metrics used, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, many developed countries have made notable progress in reducing greenhouse gases compared to the global average.

Azərbaycan nefti bəzi Avropa ölkələrinin neft istehlakının təxminən 40 faizini təşkil edir,false,az,Azerbaijani oil accounts for approximately 40 percent of the oil consumption in some European countries.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijani oil accounts for approximately 40 percent of the oil consumption in some European countries,"" we need to examine the available data on oil imports and consumption in European countries.

Azerbaijan is a significant oil producer and exporter, and it supplies oil to various European countries. However, the percentage of Azerbaijani oil in the total oil consumption of European countries can vary widely.

For example, Italy and Germany are known to import Azerbaijani oil, but the percentage of their total oil consumption that comes from Azerbaijan is generally much lower than 40%. In some smaller European countries or specific contexts, the percentage might be higher, but it is unlikely to be a common or widespread figure.

Given the variability and the lack of specific data supporting the claim that Azerbaijani oil consistently accounts for approximately 40% of the oil consumption in some European countries, the claim seems to be an overstatement.

10’ar yıllık dönemlerine böldüğümüzde işsizlikte en kötü 10 yılı yaşıyoruz. Sadece üniversite mezunu işsiz sayımız BM’de tanınan sayıya göre 70 ülkenin nüfusundan daha fazla.,mostly true,tr,"When we divide it into 10-year periods, we are experiencing the worst 10 years in terms of unemployment. The number of unemployed university graduates alone is higher than the population of 70 countries recognized by the UN.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the current 10-year period is indeed the worst in terms of unemployment compared to previous 10-year periods.
2. Whether the number of unemployed university graduates is higher than the population of 70 countries recognized by the UN.

### Point 1: Worst 10-Year Period in Terms of Unemployment
- This requires historical unemployment data over multiple decades. If the current 10-year period has the highest average unemployment rate compared to previous periods, this part of the claim could be true.

### Point 2: Number of Unemployed University Graduates
- According to the United Nations, there are 193 member states. The populations of the smallest 70 countries range from a few thousand to a few million. For example, countries like Tuvalu, Nauru, and San Marino have populations under 100,000.
- If the number of unemployed university graduates exceeds the population of these smaller countries, this part of the claim could be true.

### Verification
- Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively verify these points. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date statistics, it could be plausible.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, the claim seems to be an exaggeration but could have elements of truth if based on specific data points.

(Eğitime ayrılan bütçede) 2002 yılına kıyasla yüzde 726'lık bir artış oldu ve 62 milyara yükselttik.,half true,tr,"There was a 726% increase compared to the year 2002 in the budget allocated for education, and we raised it to 62 billion.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The budget allocated for education in the year 2002.
2. The budget allocated for education in the current year (when the claim was made).

Let's break down the claim:

- The claim states there was a 726% increase in the budget for education compared to the year 2002.
- The current budget is stated to be 62 billion.

To verify the percentage increase, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Given:
- New Value = 62 billion
- Percentage Increase = 726%

We can rearrange the formula to solve for the Old Value (budget in 2002):

\[ 726 = \left( \frac{62 - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ 7.26 = \frac{62 - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \]

\[ 7.26 \times \text{Old Value} = 62 - \text{Old Value} \]

\[ 8.26 \times \text{Old Value} = 62 \]

\[ \text{Old Value} = \frac{62}{8.26} \]

\[ \text{Old Value} \approx 7.51 \text{ billion} \]

So, if the budget in 2002 was approximately 7.51 billion, then a 726% increase would indeed result in a budget of 62 billion.

Without the exact historical data to confirm the budget in 2002, but based on the calculation, the claim appears to be mathematically consistent.

"2 milyon kız çocuğu ilk okula gidemiyor, okuma yazma bilmeyen 5 kişiden 4’ü kadın.",half true,tr,"2 million girls cannot attend primary school, and 4 out of 5 illiterate people are women.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""2 million girls cannot attend primary school, and 4 out of 5 illiterate people are women,"" we need to examine the available data on global education and literacy rates.

1. **Girls' Access to Primary Education:**
   According to UNESCO and other global education monitoring reports, millions of children, including girls, are out of school. However, the specific number of 2 million girls not attending primary school seems to be an underestimation. The actual number is likely higher, as UNESCO's data from recent years indicate that tens of millions of children, including a significant proportion of girls, are out of school.

2. **Illiteracy Among Women:**
   The claim that ""4 out of 5 illiterate people are women"" suggests that 80% of the illiterate population is female. According to UNESCO's Institute for Statistics, women do constitute a significant majority of the illiterate population, but the proportion is closer to two-thirds (approximately 66%). This means that while women are disproportionately affected by illiteracy, the figure is not as high as 80%.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but exaggerates the specifics.

Из-за мутаций коронавируса вакцина от него может быть неэффективной,half true,az,"Due to mutations of the coronavirus, the vaccine against it may be ineffective.","The claim that ""Due to mutations of the coronavirus, the vaccine against it may be ineffective"" is nuanced and requires a detailed understanding of how vaccines and viral mutations work.

1. **True**: This would mean that the statement is entirely accurate without any significant exceptions.
2. **Mostly True**: This would mean the statement is largely accurate but may have some minor exceptions or require additional context.
3. **Half True**: This would mean the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or context.
4. **Mostly False**: This would mean the statement has some element of truth but is largely inaccurate or misleading.
5. **False**: This would mean the statement is entirely inaccurate.

### Analysis:
- **Mutations and Vaccine Efficacy**: Viruses, including the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), can mutate over time. Some mutations may affect the virus's spike protein, which is the target of many vaccines.
- **Vaccine Adaptation**: Vaccines can be updated to address new variants. For example, mRNA vaccines like those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna can be relatively quickly modified to target new variants.
- **Current Evidence**: As of now, vaccines have shown varying degrees of effectiveness against different variants. Some variants may reduce vaccine efficacy, but vaccines generally still provide significant protection against severe disease and hospitalization.

### Conclusion:
The claim is somewhat accurate but lacks important context. While mutations can potentially reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, they do not necessarily render them completely ineffective. Vaccines can still offer substantial protection, and ongoing research and updates to vaccines can address new variants.

3. **Category**: The claim states that Turkey is placed in the high human development category.

According to the latest Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the HDI values, rankings, and categories are updated annually. As of the most recent report:

- Turkey's HDI value is indeed around 0.779.
- Turkey's ranking is typically around the 60s to 70s range.
- An HDI value of 0.779 generally places a country in the ""high human development"" category.

Last year alone, we earned 2 billion dollars just from exports.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether hazelnuts are indeed a profitable product for the state.
2. Whether the state earned 2 billion dollars from hazelnut exports last year.

### Point 1: Profitability of Hazelnuts
Hazelnuts are generally considered a profitable agricultural product, especially for countries like Turkey, which is the world's largest producer and exporter of hazelnuts. The profitability can be attributed to high global demand and relatively stable prices.

### Point 2: Earnings from Exports
To verify the claim of earning 2 billion dollars from hazelnut exports, we need to look at recent export data. For instance, Turkey's hazelnut export revenue has been reported to be around 2 billion dollars in recent years, which aligns with the claim.

### Conclusion
Given that hazelnuts are indeed a profitable product and the export revenue figure of 2 billion dollars is consistent with available data, the claim appears to be accurate.

1. **Historical Data (2002)**: The claim states that in 2002, the share of the national income allocated to the Ministry of National Education budget was around 17.4%. This figure seems unusually high for an education budget as a percentage of national income, which typically ranges much lower in most countries.

2. **Current Data**: The claim states that the current share has dropped to 4.8%. This figure also needs verification against recent budgetary data.

3. **Trend Analysis**: The claim suggests a consistent decrease in the share allocated to education investments over the years.

Given the unusual nature of the figures provided (17.4% in 2002 and 4.8% now), it is essential to cross-check these numbers with reliable sources such as government budget reports, economic surveys, or credible news articles.

Upon reviewing available data:
- The share of the national budget allocated to education in Turkey has generally been reported to be much lower than 17.4% in 2002. For instance, various sources indicate that the education budget as a percentage of GDP has been around 4-5% in recent years.
- The claim of a decrease to 4.8% might be more plausible if it refers to the percentage of the national budget rather than national income (GDP).

Given these points, the claim appears to be based on incorrect or misrepresented figures.

1. **Tax Contribution**: Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey and a major economic hub. It is plausible that Istanbul contributes a significant portion of Turkey's tax revenue due to its large population, high levels of economic activity, and concentration of businesses. Various reports and analyses have indicated that Istanbul contributes a substantial share of the country's tax revenue, often cited around 40-50%.

2. **Government Spending**: The claim that Istanbul receives less than 10% in return would imply a significant disparity between what the city contributes and what it receives. Government spending is typically distributed based on various factors, including population, economic needs, and political considerations. While Istanbul may not receive a proportionate amount of direct government spending relative to its tax contributions, it is important to consider indirect benefits and investments that may not be immediately apparent.

Given the complexity of government budgets and the distribution of funds, it is challenging to provide a precise figure without detailed and up-to-date financial data.

Hospital bed stock can be measured in terms of the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people or the total number of hospital beds in the country. Leading countries in this regard typically have high numbers of hospital beds per capita, ensuring adequate healthcare infrastructure.

Countries like Japan, South Korea, and Germany are often cited as having high hospital bed availability per capita. If the country in question is one of these or has similar statistics, the claim could be considered true. However, if the country does not rank highly in international comparisons, the claim would be less accurate.

1. The increase in household debt over the last 15 years.
2. The current total household debt amounting to 550 billion TL.

First, let's break down the claim:

1. **75-fold increase over 15 years**: This implies that if the household debt was X 15 years ago, it is now 75X. To verify this, we would need historical data on Turkey's household debt from 15 years ago and compare it to the current figure.

2. **Current household debt of 550 billion TL**: This requires current data on Turkey's household debt.

Without access to specific historical and current data, we can only make an educated guess based on available information. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data sources, we can analyze the plausibility:

- Turkey has experienced significant economic changes, including inflation and currency devaluation, which could contribute to a substantial increase in household debt.
- Economic reports and financial analyses often highlight rising debt levels in emerging markets like Turkey.

Given these considerations, the claim seems plausible but requires verification from reliable financial data sources.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on reliable data, we can make an educated guess.

1. The age of drug use falling below 11: This is a specific and alarming statistic that would typically require substantial evidence from health or social services reports.
2. The number of people seeking treatment increasing 19 times in 9 years: This is a significant increase and would also need to be backed by data from treatment centers or health organizations.

1. **Source Verification**: Check reliable sources such as government reports, environmental organizations, and international databases (e.g., FAO, World Bank) for data on forest area changes in Turkey during the AKP period.

2. **Data Analysis**: Compare the reported net loss of 164,222 decares (which is equivalent to 16,422.2 hectares) with the verified data from these sources.

3. **Contextual Factors**: Consider any relevant factors that might affect forest area, such as reforestation efforts, deforestation rates, and natural events (e.g., wildfires).

Without access to specific data sources and verification, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on a credible source and there is no significant contradictory evidence, we might lean towards a preliminary assessment.

**Hypothetical Verification**:
- If verified data shows a net loss close to 164,222 decares, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the data shows a significantly different figure, the claim could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the hypothetical scenario where the claim is reasonably accurate:

"Türkiye'deki eğitim standartları İngiltere'den, hatta Amerika'dan daha iyi.",false,tr,"The education standards in Turkey are better than those in England, and even the United States.","To evaluate the claim that ""The education standards in Turkey are better than those in England, and even the United States,"" we need to consider various metrics and data sources that compare education systems across countries. These metrics often include international assessments like PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment), literacy rates, graduation rates, and other indicators of educational quality and outcomes.

1. **PISA Scores**: The PISA assessment, conducted by the OECD, measures 15-year-olds' abilities in reading, mathematics, and science. Historically, countries like England and the United States have tended to score higher than Turkey in these assessments.

2. **Higher Education Rankings**: Universities in the United States and England often rank higher in global university rankings compared to those in Turkey. Institutions like Harvard, MIT, and Oxford are consistently at the top.

3. **Literacy Rates and Graduation Rates**: Both the United States and England generally have higher literacy rates and higher secondary and tertiary education graduation rates compared to Turkey.

4. **Educational Expenditure**: The United States and England typically spend more per student on education compared to Turkey, which can be an indicator of the resources available for educational quality.

Given these points, the claim that ""The education standards in Turkey are better than those in England, and even the United States"" does not align with the available data and international assessments.

Qoşulmama Hərəkatına sədrlik uğurlu xarici siyasətimizin və hərəkatın üzvlərinin ölkəmizə yüksək etimadının təzahürüdür,half true,az,The chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement is a manifestation of our successful foreign policy and the high trust of the movement's members in our country.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Successful Foreign Policy**: The chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) can be seen as a recognition of a country's diplomatic efforts and its ability to navigate international relations effectively. If the country in question has been active and influential in international forums, it could be argued that this is a manifestation of successful foreign policy.

2. **High Trust of the Movement's Members**: The chairmanship is typically decided by consensus among the member states. If a country is chosen to lead, it generally indicates a level of trust and respect from other members. However, this trust might be influenced by various factors, including political alliances, economic interests, and regional dynamics.

Given these points, the claim can be seen as a reasonable interpretation of the situation, though it might be somewhat subjective. The chairmanship does suggest a level of trust and recognition, but it doesn't necessarily provide a complete picture of the country's overall foreign policy success.

Kamuda çalışan 800 bin taşeron işçisi var.,mostly true,tr,There are 800 thousand subcontracted workers employed in the public sector.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""There are 800 thousand subcontracted workers employed in the public sector,"" we would need to verify the most recent and reliable data from credible sources such as government reports, labor statistics, or reputable research organizations.

Without access to specific data at this moment, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to assess it:

1. **Check Government Reports**: Look for official statistics from government labor departments or agencies that track employment figures in the public sector.
2. **Consult Research Organizations**: Review reports from think tanks or research institutions that study labor markets and public sector employment.
3. **Media and News Outlets**: Reliable news sources may have reported on the number of subcontracted workers in the public sector.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to such data and it confirms the figure, you could then classify the claim accordingly.

AKP'li yıllarda tarımsal üretim yerinde saymış; hatta bazı ürünlerde gerilemiştir.,mostly true,tr,"During the years of the AKP, agricultural production has stagnated; in fact, it has even declined for some products.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""During the years of the AKP, agricultural production has stagnated; in fact, it has even declined for some products,"" we need to examine data and reports on agricultural production in Turkey during the tenure of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), which has been in power since 2002.

1. **Stagnation and Decline in Agricultural Production**: 
   - Various reports and data from sources such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) and international organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) can provide insights into trends in agricultural production.
   - Some reports indicate that while there have been periods of growth in certain agricultural sectors, other sectors have experienced stagnation or decline. For example, production of certain crops like wheat and sugar beet has faced challenges, while other areas like fruit and vegetable production have seen growth.

2. **Economic and Policy Factors**:
   - Factors such as changes in agricultural policy, economic conditions, and external factors like climate change and global market trends have influenced agricultural production.
   - The AKP government has implemented various agricultural policies, some of which have been criticized for not adequately supporting small farmers or addressing structural issues in the agricultural sector.

3. **Expert Opinions and Analyses**:
   - Analyses by agricultural experts and economists often highlight mixed results, with some products experiencing growth and others facing decline or stagnation.
   - For instance, a report by the Turkish Union of Agricultural Chambers (TZOB) might show that while overall agricultural GDP has grown, specific sectors have not kept pace.

Given the mixed nature of the data, with evidence supporting both growth in some areas and decline or stagnation in others, the claim appears to be partially accurate but not entirely comprehensive.

Qaz hasilatında müsbət dinamika davamlı xarakter daşıyır,half true,az,The positive trend in gas production continues consistently.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The positive trend in gas production continues consistently,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Historical Data**: Review historical data on gas production to see if there has been a consistent increase over a significant period.
2. **Recent Trends**: Examine recent reports and statistics to confirm if the positive trend is ongoing.
3. **External Factors**: Consider any external factors that might have influenced gas production, such as economic conditions, technological advancements, regulatory changes, or geopolitical events.

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and reliable data, we can make an educated guess.

Given that gas production has generally been increasing due to technological advancements in extraction methods (like fracking) and growing global energy demands, it is reasonable to assume that the trend has been positive. However, the term ""consistently"" implies no significant fluctuations, which might not always be the case due to market dynamics and other factors.

"(son bir yılda) Bebek mamaları yüzde 100, pişik kremleri ise yüzde 70 zamlandı.",mostly false,tr,"In the past year, baby formulas have increased by 100%, and diaper rash creams have increased by 70%.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In the past year, baby formulas have increased by 100%, and diaper rash creams have increased by 70%,"" we would need to verify the specific price changes of these products over the past year using reliable sources such as market reports, retail price data, or industry analyses.

Without access to this specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to assess such claims:

1. **Check Market Reports**: Look for reports from market research firms that track the prices of baby products.
2. **Retail Price Data**: Compare the prices of baby formulas and diaper rash creams from major retailers over the past year.
3. **Industry Analysis**: Review industry publications or statements from manufacturers regarding price changes.

1. **Historical Context and Reports**: There have been numerous reports from international human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, indicating that lawyers in Azerbaijan have faced persecution and pressure. These reports often cite instances of harassment, disbarment, and even imprisonment of lawyers who take on politically sensitive cases or criticize the government.

2. **Government Response**: The Azerbaijani government has consistently denied these allegations, claiming that any actions taken against lawyers are based on legal grounds and not politically motivated.

3. **Independent Verification**: Independent verification of these claims can be challenging due to restricted access to information and potential biases in reporting from both government and opposition sources.

Given the consistent reports from credible international organizations about the persecution and pressure on lawyers in Azerbaijan, it is unlikely that all such information is entirely false and fabricated. However, without specific evidence to support every individual claim, it is also possible that some reports may be exaggerated or not fully accurate.

1. The time period during which the Presidential Government System was in place.
2. The debt per capita at the beginning and end of this period.
3. Reliable sources or official data that confirm these figures.

Without access to specific data or sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the figures provided are accurate and reflect the actual increase in debt per capita during the specified period under the Presidential Government System, the claim would be considered true.

Given the lack of specific data verification in this context, I can only provide a tentative assessment based on the assumption that the figures are correct.

"Turizmde Türkiye'de yüzde 2,5 gerileme yaşandı.",half true,tr,A 2.5% decline was experienced in tourism in Turkey.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""A 2.5% decline was experienced in tourism in Turkey,"" I would need to verify the most recent and reliable data on tourism statistics in Turkey. This information is typically available from sources such as the Turkish Statistical Institute, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Turkey, or international tourism organizations.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and accurate data, it could be considered true. If the data shows a different percentage or an increase instead of a decline, the claim would be false.

ABD’de nükleer enerjinin payı artacak.,false,tr,The share of nuclear energy in the USA will increase.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The share of nuclear energy in the USA will increase,"" we need to consider several factors, including current trends, government policies, and industry developments.

1. **Current Trends**: As of recent years, the share of nuclear energy in the USA has been relatively stable, contributing about 20% of the total electricity generation. However, some older nuclear plants are being retired, which could potentially decrease the share unless new plants come online.

2. **Government Policies**: The U.S. government has shown interest in maintaining and potentially increasing the share of nuclear energy as part of its strategy to reduce carbon emissions. This includes support for advanced nuclear technologies and small modular reactors (SMRs).

3. **Industry Developments**: There are ongoing developments in the nuclear sector, including the construction of new reactors and advancements in nuclear technology. For example, the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia is adding two new reactors, which could contribute to an increase in nuclear energy share.

4. **Challenges**: Despite these positive indicators, the nuclear industry faces significant challenges, including high costs, regulatory hurdles, and competition from cheaper renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

Given these considerations, the claim that the share of nuclear energy in the USA will increase is not guaranteed but is supported by certain trends and policies. Therefore, the claim is not entirely certain but has a reasonable basis.

Koronavirusla bağlı fonda ən böyük ianəni dövlət tərəfindən prezident edib,half true,az,The largest donation to the coronavirus-related fund was made by the state through the president.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The largest donation to the coronavirus-related fund was made by the state through the president,"" we need to verify the details of the largest donations made to coronavirus-related funds and whether the state, through the president, was indeed responsible for the largest one.

1. **Verification of Largest Donations**: 
   - Various countries and organizations made significant donations to coronavirus-related funds.
   - Private individuals, corporations, and international organizations also contributed large sums.

2. **State Contributions**:
   - Many governments allocated substantial funds for coronavirus relief efforts.
   - The role of the president in these allocations can vary by country, but typically, large state donations are part of broader governmental decisions rather than individual actions by the president.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - If the largest donation was indeed from a state, it would need to be compared against the largest private and organizational donations to confirm it was the largest overall.

Without specific data on the exact amounts and sources of the largest donations, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, based on general knowledge, it is plausible that a state could make one of the largest donations, but attributing it directly to the president might be an oversimplification.

14 yılda 6 bin 100 kilometrenin üzerine 18 bin 500 kilometre daha yol koyduk.,mostly false,tr,"In 14 years, we added 18,500 kilometers more to the 6,100 kilometers.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In 14 years, we added 18,500 kilometers more to the 6,100 kilometers,"" we need to break down the statement into its components and verify each part.

1. **Time Frame**: The claim specifies a period of 14 years.
2. **Initial Distance**: The initial distance mentioned is 6,100 kilometers.
3. **Additional Distance**: The additional distance added over the 14 years is 18,500 kilometers.

The claim does not specify what type of distance is being referred to (e.g., roads, railways, etc.), nor does it provide a specific context or source for these numbers. However, assuming the numbers are accurate and the context is consistent, the claim can be evaluated based on the arithmetic:

- Initial distance: 6,100 kilometers
- Additional distance: 18,500 kilometers
- Total distance after 14 years: 6,100 km + 18,500 km = 24,600 kilometers

If the context and numbers are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. However, without additional context or verification of the specific figures, it is challenging to fully validate the claim. Given the information provided, the arithmetic checks out.

16 yıllık AK Parti iktidarında 2 trilyon dolar vergi toplandı.,true,tr,"During the 16-year rule of the AK Party, 2 trillion dollars in taxes were collected.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""During the 16-year rule of the AK Party, 2 trillion dollars in taxes were collected,"" we need to consider several factors, including historical tax revenue data, exchange rates, and economic conditions during the AK Party's tenure.

1. **Historical Context**: The AK Party (Justice and Development Party) has been in power in Turkey since 2002. Therefore, the 16-year period would span from 2002 to 2018.

2. **Tax Revenue Data**: According to available data from the Turkish Ministry of Finance and other financial reports, Turkey's annual tax revenue has varied significantly over the years. For instance, in the early 2000s, annual tax revenue was much lower compared to the mid-2010s.

3. **Exchange Rates**: The value of the Turkish Lira (TRY) against the US Dollar (USD) has fluctuated considerably over this period. This fluctuation affects the conversion of tax revenue figures from TRY to USD.

4. **Economic Growth**: Turkey experienced significant economic growth during parts of the AK Party's rule, which would have increased tax revenues.

Given these considerations, it is plausible that the cumulative tax revenue over 16 years could reach a figure close to 2 trillion USD, especially when considering the growth in tax revenue in later years and the impact of exchange rates.

However, without precise annual tax revenue figures and exact exchange rates for each year, it is challenging to definitively confirm the exact total.

Otoriter rejimlerde enflasyon oranları demokrasilerdeki ortalamanın neredeyse 20 katı.,mostly true,tr,"In authoritarian regimes, inflation rates are nearly 20 times the average in democracies.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In authoritarian regimes, inflation rates are nearly 20 times the average in democracies,"" we need to consider empirical data and research on inflation rates in different types of political regimes.

1. **Empirical Data**: Studies and data from sources like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and academic research often show that inflation rates tend to be higher in authoritarian regimes compared to democracies. This is due to various factors such as lack of institutional checks and balances, less transparency, and often more erratic economic policies in authoritarian regimes.

2. **Quantitative Comparison**: While it is generally accepted that inflation rates are higher in authoritarian regimes, the specific claim that they are ""nearly 20 times"" higher is a precise quantitative statement that requires specific data to verify. Most studies do not provide such an exact multiplier but do indicate a significant difference.

3. **Research Findings**: For example, a study by Al-Marhubi (2000) found that inflation rates in autocracies were significantly higher than in democracies, but the exact multiplier can vary. Another study by Aisen and Veiga (2008) also supports the notion that political instability, which is more common in authoritarian regimes, is associated with higher inflation.

Given the general consensus in the literature that inflation is higher in authoritarian regimes but the lack of consistent evidence to support the exact figure of ""20 times,"" the claim seems to be an exaggeration of the actual difference.

1. **Source of the Claim**: Identify where the claim originated. Is it from a credible source, such as a government report, a reputable news organization, or a recognized research institution?

2. **Data Verification**: Check if there are available statistics or studies that support or refute the claim. This could include government labor statistics, reports from women's rights organizations, or academic research.

3. **Context and Definitions**: Understand what is meant by ""women whose lives are limited to the home."" Does this refer to women who are homemakers, unemployed, or otherwise not participating in the workforce? The definition can significantly impact the interpretation of the data.

4. **Current Government Policies**: Review the policies implemented by the current government that might influence women's participation in the workforce. Are there specific policies that encourage or discourage women from working outside the home?

Without specific data and context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the need for evidence and the complexity of the issue, we can make an informed judgment.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the claim and the need for more detailed verification, the most appropriate categorization would be:

1. **Historical Context**: The AXCP (Azerbaijan Popular Front Party) and Müsavat Party were part of the government in Azerbaijan during the early 1990s, particularly around 1992-1993.
2. **Vineyard Destruction**: There were significant agricultural changes and disruptions in Azerbaijan during the early 1990s, including the destruction of vineyards. However, attributing a specific figure like 267 thousand hectares directly to the AXCP-Müsavat duo's period in power requires concrete evidence.
3. **Verification**: Without specific and reliable sources confirming the exact figure and directly linking it to the AXCP-Müsavat period, it is challenging to fully verify the claim.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to support the exact figure and the direct attribution to the AXCP-Müsavat period, the claim appears to be an overstatement or lacks sufficient verification.

Yüce Divan’a gönderilmesi istenenler çoğunlukla konuşma yapmadılar,true,tr,Those who were requested to be sent to the Supreme Court mostly did not speak.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Those who were requested to be sent to the Supreme Court mostly did not speak,"" we need to consider the context and historical data regarding individuals who have been requested to appear before the Supreme Court.

1. **Supreme Court Nominees**: If the claim refers to individuals nominated to the Supreme Court, they typically do speak during their confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. These hearings are public and involve extensive questioning.

2. **Witnesses or Litigants**: If the claim refers to witnesses or litigants in cases before the Supreme Court, it is important to note that the Supreme Court does not typically request individuals to appear. Instead, cases are brought before the Court, and attorneys present oral arguments. The individuals involved in the cases do not usually speak directly to the Court.

3. **Historical Context**: Historically, the Supreme Court's procedures involve attorneys presenting cases, and the Justices asking questions. The individuals directly involved in the cases (e.g., plaintiffs, defendants) do not usually speak unless they are representing themselves, which is rare.

Given these points, the claim seems to be a generalization that does not accurately reflect the specific procedures and contexts of the Supreme Court. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

You look at the scales of the IMF and the OECD, we are the best-positioned country.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the current data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) regarding the growth rates of various countries.

1. **IMF Data**: The IMF regularly publishes the World Economic Outlook, which includes growth rate projections for countries around the world. We would need to check the latest report to see which country has the highest projected growth rate.

2. **OECD Data**: Similarly, the OECD publishes economic outlooks and growth projections for its member countries. We would need to verify the latest data to see if the country in question is indeed the best-positioned in terms of growth rate.

Without the specific data at hand, we can make a general assessment based on typical trends and recent reports. Historically, countries with the highest growth rates are often emerging markets rather than developed economies. However, exceptional circumstances (such as post-pandemic recovery) can sometimes lead to unusual growth patterns.

Given the need for specific and up-to-date data to make a precise determination, and considering that the claim is quite broad and absolute, it is challenging to fully verify it without the latest figures.

**Assessment**:
- If recent IMF and OECD reports do show the country in question as having the highest growth rate, the claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the country is among the top but not the absolute highest, the claim could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.
- If the country is not near the top in growth rate, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the broad and absolute nature of the claim and the typical trends in economic growth rates, it is likely that the claim is somewhat exaggerated.

Qeyri-neft sektorundakı dövriyyənin artımı ÜDM-in artımını üstələyib,half true,az,The increase in turnover in the non-oil sector has outpaced the growth of GDP.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The increase in turnover in the non-oil sector has outpaced the growth of GDP,"" we need to compare the growth rates of the non-oil sector's turnover and the overall GDP growth. 

1. **Turnover in the Non-Oil Sector**: This refers to the total revenue generated by businesses in the non-oil sector. An increase in turnover indicates that these businesses are generating more revenue over time.

2. **GDP Growth**: This is the rate at which a country's economy is growing, measured by the increase in the value of all goods and services produced within the country.

If the turnover in the non-oil sector is growing at a faster rate than the overall GDP, the claim would be true. Conversely, if the GDP is growing faster or at the same rate as the non-oil sector's turnover, the claim would be false or mostly false.

Without specific data to compare these growth rates, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on available data and trends, we can make an educated guess.

**Assumption**: If the statement is based on recent economic trends where non-oil sectors (like technology, services, manufacturing) are experiencing rapid growth compared to the overall GDP, it is plausible.

**Conclusion**: Given the assumption that the non-oil sector is experiencing significant growth, it is reasonable to consider the claim as 'Mostly True'.

Tarihin en alt seviyesine indi Türkiye'deki sendikalaşma...,mostly true,tr,Unionization in Turkey has dropped to its lowest level in history...,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Unionization in Turkey has dropped to its lowest level in history,"" we need to examine historical and current data on union membership and unionization rates in Turkey.

1. **Historical Context**: Unionization in Turkey has experienced various fluctuations due to political, economic, and social factors. Historically, union membership was higher during certain periods, especially when labor movements were stronger and labor laws were more favorable.

2. **Current Data**: According to recent reports and statistics, unionization rates in Turkey have indeed been declining. For instance, data from the Turkish Statistical Institute and other labor organizations indicate a significant drop in union membership over the past few decades.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: To assert that unionization is at its ""lowest level in history,"" we need to compare current unionization rates with historical lows. If current rates are indeed the lowest recorded, the claim would be accurate.

Based on available data and trends, it appears that unionization rates in Turkey are at or near historical lows, but without precise historical data for every period, it is challenging to definitively confirm this as the absolute lowest point in history.

The claim that women are doing the same job as men but are receiving 20% less pay is generally supported by data on the gender pay gap. While the exact percentage can vary depending on the country, industry, and specific job roles, numerous studies have shown that women, on average, earn less than men for similar work. However, the exact figure of 20% may not be universally accurate, and there are many factors that contribute to the pay gap, including discrimination, differences in work experience, and occupational segregation.

Son 25 il ərzində ölkədə ümumi daxili məhsul 216 dəfə artıb,false,az,"Over the past 25 years, the country's gross domestic product has increased 216 times.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that a country's gross domestic product (GDP) has increased 216 times over the past 25 years, we need to consider the typical growth rates of GDP and historical data.

1. **Historical GDP Growth Rates**: Most countries experience GDP growth rates that range from a few percent to double digits annually. A 216-fold increase over 25 years implies an extraordinarily high average annual growth rate.

2. **Mathematical Calculation**: To understand the feasibility, we can use the formula for compound growth:
   \[
   \text{Final GDP} = \text{Initial GDP} \times (1 + r)^{25}
   \]
   where \( r \) is the annual growth rate. Solving for \( r \) when the final GDP is 216 times the initial GDP:
   \[
   216 = (1 + r)^{25}
   \]
   Taking the 25th root of both sides:
   \[
   1 + r = 216^{1/25} \approx 1.317
   \]
   So, \( r \approx 0.317 \) or 31.7%.

3. **Realistic Growth Rates**: Sustaining an average annual growth rate of 31.7% over 25 years is highly improbable for any country. Historically, even the fastest-growing economies, such as China during its peak growth years, have not sustained such high growth rates over such a long period.

Given these points, the claim that a country's GDP has increased 216 times over 25 years is highly unlikely.

Mobil məhkəmə”nin tətbiqinə görə birincilər sırasındayıq,mostly true,az,"We are among the first in the implementation of the ""Mobile Court"".","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are among the first in the implementation of the 'Mobile Court',"" we need to consider the context and available evidence regarding the implementation of mobile courts globally or within a specific region.

Mobile courts, which are judicial systems that travel to remote or underserved areas to provide legal services, have been implemented in various countries over the years. For example, countries like Kenya, Bangladesh, and the Philippines have had mobile court systems in place for some time. If the entity making the claim is in a country or region where mobile courts are a relatively new initiative compared to these examples, the claim could be considered accurate.

However, without specific details about the timeline and the context (e.g., the country or region in question), it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. Given that mobile courts have been implemented in several countries for years, the claim might be somewhat overstated unless it refers to a very specific context where the implementation is indeed among the first.

Azərbaycanda 1 milyon 600 min nəfər stabil maaş alır,mostly true,az,"In Azerbaijan, 1 million 600 thousand people receive a stable salary.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Azerbaijan, 1 million 600 thousand people receive a stable salary,"" we need to look at reliable sources such as government statistics, labor reports, or credible news articles that provide data on employment and salary distribution in Azerbaijan.

As of the latest available data, the State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan provides information on employment and wages. According to their reports, the number of people employed in the formal sector and receiving regular wages can be estimated. However, the exact number can fluctuate due to various factors such as economic conditions, changes in employment rates, and data collection methods.

Given that the population of Azerbaijan is around 10 million, and considering the labor force participation rate and employment statistics, the figure of 1.6 million people receiving a stable salary seems plausible but would need precise verification from the latest official statistics.

Without access to the most recent and specific data, it is challenging to confirm the exact number. However, based on the general employment trends and available information, the claim appears to be within a reasonable range.

Without access to specific data or sources, it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified data, it could be considered true. If there is any doubt about the accuracy or if the data is not from a reliable source, the claim could be considered less accurate.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, I cannot definitively categorize it. Therefore, I must refrain from making a final judgment.

Erdoğan'ın Suriyelilere kitlesel vatandaşlık vermesinin modern dünyada eşi yok.,mostly true,tr,Erdoğan's mass granting of citizenship to Syrians is unprecedented in the modern world.,"To evaluate the claim that ""Erdoğan's mass granting of citizenship to Syrians is unprecedented in the modern world,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Scale and Context**: Turkey has indeed granted citizenship to a significant number of Syrian refugees. As of recent reports, hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been granted Turkish citizenship since the Syrian civil war began in 2011.

2. **Comparison with Other Countries**: While Turkey's actions are notable, other countries have also undertaken large-scale naturalization efforts in modern history. For example, Germany granted citizenship to a large number of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Similarly, Israel has a policy of granting citizenship to Jews from around the world under the Law of Return.

3. **Modern Context**: The term ""modern world"" can be interpreted in various ways, but if we consider the post-World War II era, there have been several instances of mass naturalization efforts, especially in response to crises or large-scale migrations.

Given these points, while Turkey's actions are significant and impactful, they are not entirely without precedent when compared to other large-scale naturalization efforts in recent history.

Bu ülkenin son dönemlerdeki en düşük güven endeksine sahip ülke durumuna geldik.,mostly true,tr,We have become the country with the lowest confidence index in recent times.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have become the country with the lowest confidence index in recent times,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Definition of Confidence Index**: The confidence index typically refers to a measure of the confidence of consumers or businesses in the economic prospects of a country. This can be measured through various surveys and indices, such as the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) or Business Confidence Index (BCI).

2. **Recent Data**: We need to look at the most recent data from reputable sources that measure confidence indices globally. Organizations like the OECD, World Bank, or specific national statistics agencies often publish such data.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: We need to compare the confidence index of the country in question with those of other countries to determine if it indeed has the lowest confidence index.

Without specific data and a clear reference to the country in question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is about a specific country and recent data supports that this country has the lowest confidence index among a significant number of countries, then the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we can only make a general assessment based on the typical process of verification.

Dünyada en çok mülteciye ev sahipliği yapan ülke Türkiye. Milli gelire oranla dünyada en fazla insani kalkınma yardımı yapan ülke biz olduk.,mostly true,tr,Turkey is the country that hosts the most refugees in the world. We have become the country that provides the most humanitarian development aid in the world relative to national income.,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at two main points:

1. **Turkey hosting the most refugees in the world**: According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Turkey has been hosting the largest number of refugees globally for several years, primarily due to the influx of Syrian refugees. As of recent data, Turkey continues to host millions of refugees, making this part of the claim accurate.

2. **Turkey providing the most humanitarian development aid relative to national income**: According to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Turkey has been recognized for its significant contributions to humanitarian aid relative to its Gross National Income (GNI). Turkey has consistently ranked high in terms of the proportion of its national income dedicated to humanitarian aid.

Given these points, the claim appears to be well-supported by available data.

15 yılda asgari ücreti yaklaşık 9 kat artırmış olduk ve hiçbir zaman da enflasyonun altına düşürmedik.,mostly false,tr,"'In 15 years, we have increased the minimum wage by approximately 9 times and we have never let it fall below inflation.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The minimum wage has been increased approximately 9 times in the past 15 years.
2. The minimum wage has never fallen below the rate of inflation during this period.

Let's break down the analysis:

1. **Frequency of Minimum Wage Increases**:
   - We need to check historical data on minimum wage adjustments over the past 15 years. If the minimum wage has indeed been increased around 9 times, this part of the claim would be accurate.

2. **Minimum Wage vs. Inflation**:
   - We need to compare the minimum wage adjustments with inflation rates over the same period. If the minimum wage has consistently kept pace with or exceeded inflation, this part of the claim would be accurate.

Without specific data, we can only hypothesize based on general trends. In many countries, minimum wage adjustments do not always occur annually and may not always keep pace with inflation. However, some countries do have policies to ensure minimum wage adjustments are in line with inflation.

Given the complexity and variability of these factors, and without concrete data to confirm both points definitively, the claim seems to be an overgeneralization.

The AK Party came to power in Turkey in November 2002.

1. **Historical Gasoline Prices (2002):**
   - In 2002, the price of gasoline in Turkey was approximately 0.59 TL per liter.
   - With 50 TL, you could buy approximately 85 liters of gasoline (50 TL / 0.59 TL per liter ≈ 85 liters).

2. **Current Gasoline Prices:**
   - As of recent data, the price of gasoline in Turkey is around 20 TL per liter.
   - With 50 TL, you can buy approximately 2.5 liters of gasoline (50 TL / 20 TL per liter ≈ 2.5 liters).

The claim states that you can now get 7 liters of gasoline for 50 TL, which is not accurate based on the current price of gasoline. The actual amount you can get is significantly less than 7 liters.

**Conclusion:**
- The historical part of the claim (85 liters for 50 TL in 2002) is accurate.
- The current part of the claim (7 liters for 50 TL) is inaccurate.

1999 yılından beri dünyanın en büyük 20 ekonomisinden biriyiz.,mostly true,tr,"Since 1999, we have been one of the world's 20 largest economies.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Since 1999, we have been one of the world's 20 largest economies,"" we need to consider historical data on global economies. The list of the world's largest economies is typically measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is published by various organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.

If we look at the historical GDP rankings from 1999 to the present, we can see that certain countries have consistently been in the top 20. These countries include the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, India, Italy, Brazil, Canada, Russia, South Korea, Australia, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and a few others.

To verify the claim, we would need to identify the specific country being referred to and check its GDP ranking over the years. However, without specifying the country, we can make a general assessment based on the typical countries that have been in the top 20.

Given that the list of the top 20 economies has remained relatively stable with only minor changes over the years, it is likely that the claim is accurate for many of the countries that have been consistently in the top 20.

If there are reports or evidence indicating that journalists were able to perform their duties without any significant obstacles, then the claim would be 'True'. If there were minor issues but overall journalists could work effectively, it might be 'Mostly True'. If there were notable hindrances but not to the extent of completely preventing their work, it could be 'Half True'. If there were significant obstacles that made it difficult for journalists to carry out their activities, it would be 'Mostly False'. If journalists were completely prevented from doing their work, the claim would be 'False'.

Without specific evidence or reports to evaluate, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the phrasing of the claim, which suggests no hindrance at all, and assuming no contrary evidence is presented, the most appropriate response would be:

Türkiye'de her gün yaklaşık 10 kişi intihar ediyor. Halkın psikolojisi bozuldu. Bu devirde imam intihar ediyorsa cemaat ne yapmaz?,mostly false,tr,"Approximately 10 people commit suicide every day in Turkey. The public's mental health has deteriorated. If an imam is committing suicide in these times, what won't the congregation do?","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. **""Approximately 10 people commit suicide every day in Turkey.""**
   - According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other reliable sources, Turkey has a suicide rate of about 4-5 per 100,000 people per year. Given Turkey's population of around 84 million, this translates to roughly 9-12 suicides per day. This part of the claim appears to be accurate.

2. **""The public's mental health has deteriorated.""**
   - This is a more subjective statement, but there have been reports and studies indicating that mental health issues have been on the rise globally, including in Turkey, especially due to factors like economic instability, the COVID-19 pandemic, and social issues. While it's difficult to quantify precisely, there is evidence to support the notion that mental health concerns are increasing.

3. **""If an imam is committing suicide in these times, what won't the congregation do?""**
   - This part of the claim is more speculative and rhetorical. It suggests that if a religious leader, who is typically seen as a figure of stability and guidance, is committing suicide, it could have a demoralizing effect on the community. While this is a plausible concern, it is not a verifiable fact and leans more towards opinion.

Given the information available:

- The first part of the claim about the number of suicides per day is accurate.
- The second part about deteriorating mental health is supported by general trends and reports.
- The third part is speculative and rhetorical, making it less factual and more interpretative.

Given that I don't have access to real-time data, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to assess the claim:

1. **Check Official Statistics**: Look for the latest reports from the national statistics office or labor department.
2. **Research Studies**: Review studies or surveys conducted by universities or research institutions.
3. **News Reports**: Reliable news sources may have covered this issue with relevant data.

If the data shows that nearly 1 in 3 university graduates is unemployed, the claim would be 'True'. If the data is close but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the data is somewhat accurate but not close enough, it could be 'Half True'. If the data significantly contradicts the claim, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Despite all these resources, it's 3.6%.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific growth rates mentioned for both the world's average growth and the growth of the Islamic community. 

1. **World's Average Growth Rate**: The global economic growth rate varies year by year and is influenced by numerous factors. According to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economic growth rate has fluctuated around 3% to 4% in recent years, but it is not consistently at 4.7%.

2. **Growth of the Islamic Community**: The growth rate of the Islamic community can refer to either population growth or economic growth within predominantly Muslim countries. The population growth rate in many Muslim-majority countries has been higher than the global average, often exceeding 2% to 3%. However, economic growth rates in these countries vary widely and are influenced by factors such as oil prices, political stability, and economic policies.

Given the lack of specific and consistent data to support the exact figures mentioned (4.7% for the world and 3.6% for the Islamic community), the claim appears to be inaccurate or at least misleading.

1. **EU Average Youth Unemployment Rate**: According to recent data, the youth unemployment rate in the EU has been around 14.3%.
2. **OECD Average Youth Unemployment Rate**: The OECD average youth unemployment rate has been approximately 11.2%.
3. **South Korea's Youth Unemployment Rate**: South Korea's youth unemployment rate has been around 10.4%.
4. **Mexico's Youth Unemployment Rate**: Mexico's youth unemployment rate has been around 7.2%.

The claim states that the youth unemployment rate is over 25%. This part of the claim is not specific to a particular country or region, so it is ambiguous. However, if we assume it refers to a specific country or region with a high youth unemployment rate, such as certain Southern European countries, this could be accurate.

Given the provided data points are correct and the statement about the youth unemployment rate being over 25% is plausible for certain regions, the claim can be considered accurate in context.

1. **Timeline of COVID-19 Funds**: Various countries and organizations established COVID-19 response funds around the same time in early 2020. For instance, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund in March 2020. Many countries, including Azerbaijan, also set up national funds to combat the pandemic.

2. **Azerbaijan's COVID-19 Fund**: Azerbaijan did establish a COVID-19 Response Fund in March 2020, which was one of the early national funds created to address the pandemic.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: While Azerbaijan was among the early adopters of a national COVID-19 fund, it is not definitively clear that it was the very first. Other countries and international organizations were also quick to respond with similar initiatives.

Given this context, the claim that Azerbaijan created the first COVID-19 fund is not entirely accurate but does reflect that Azerbaijan was proactive and among the early countries to establish such a fund.

1. The cost of aid to Syria by Turkey over 4 years is approximately $5 billion.
2. The contribution of European countries, Western countries, Islamic countries, and international organizations is $245 million.

### Verification:

1. **Cost of Aid by Turkey:**
   - Various reports and statements from Turkish officials have indicated that Turkey has spent significant amounts on aid for Syrian refugees and related efforts. Estimates often range in the billions of dollars, with some sources citing figures around $5 billion or even higher over multiple years.

2. **Contributions from Other Countries and Organizations:**
   - Contributions from European countries, Western countries, Islamic countries, and international organizations to aid efforts in Syria and for Syrian refugees in Turkey have been documented. However, the exact figure of $245 million seems low compared to some reports that suggest higher contributions, especially from the European Union and other international bodies.

### Analysis:

- The claim about Turkey spending approximately $5 billion on aid over 4 years is plausible and aligns with various reports.
- The claim about the contributions from other countries and organizations being $245 million appears to be an underestimation based on available data.

Given that one part of the claim is accurate and the other part is likely an underestimation, the overall claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth.

Azərbaycan vətəndaşlarının hüquqlarının qorunmasında Ombudsman təsisatının böyük rolu var,false,az,The Ombudsman institution plays a significant role in protecting the rights of Azerbaijani citizens.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Ombudsman institution plays a significant role in protecting the rights of Azerbaijani citizens,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Mandate and Function**: The Ombudsman institution in Azerbaijan, also known as the Commissioner for Human Rights, is mandated to protect human rights and freedoms. This includes investigating complaints from citizens about violations of their rights by state bodies, local self-government bodies, and officials.

2. **Legal Framework**: The institution operates under the Azerbaijani Constitution and specific laws that outline its powers and responsibilities. It has the authority to make recommendations, propose legislative changes, and report on human rights issues.

3. **Effectiveness and Impact**: The effectiveness of the Ombudsman institution can be gauged by its ability to address complaints, influence policy, and bring about tangible improvements in human rights protection. Reports and assessments from international organizations, such as the United Nations or the Council of Europe, can provide insights into its performance.

4. **Challenges and Limitations**: Despite its mandate, the Ombudsman institution may face challenges such as limited resources, political pressure, or lack of enforcement power. These factors can affect its ability to protect citizens' rights effectively.

Considering these points, the claim can be evaluated as follows:

- The Ombudsman institution has a clear mandate to protect human rights and has a legal framework supporting its activities.
- It has the authority to investigate complaints and make recommendations.
- However, the effectiveness of the institution can be limited by external factors such as political influence and resource constraints.

Given this context, the claim that the Ombudsman institution plays a significant role in protecting the rights of Azerbaijani citizens is not entirely straightforward. While the institution has the potential and mandate to play a significant role, its actual impact may be constrained by various challenges.

Khalid Bagirov is a well-known human rights lawyer from Azerbaijan who has faced legal challenges and disbarment, often attributed to his outspoken criticism of the government and his defense of political activists. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in favor of Bagirov in some cases, indicating that his actions were within the bounds of freedom of expression as protected under international human rights law.

Avrupa’nın son 4 yılda aldığı mülteciyi biz bir haftada almışız,mostly true,tr,"In the last 4 years, we have taken in as many refugees in one week as Europe has.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In the last 4 years, we have taken in as many refugees in one week as Europe has,"" we need to compare the number of refugees taken in by the entity making the claim (presumably a country or region) with the number of refugees taken in by Europe over the same period.

1. **Identify the entity making the claim**: Without specific information about which country or region is making the claim, it's challenging to verify the numbers accurately. However, for the sake of analysis, let's assume the claim is made by a country like the United States.

2. **Refugee intake in Europe**: According to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Europe has taken in a significant number of refugees over the past several years. For example, during the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015, Europe received over 1 million refugees. In subsequent years, the numbers have varied but remained substantial.

3. **Refugee intake in the United States**: The U.S. refugee admissions have varied over the years. For instance, in fiscal year 2016, the U.S. admitted around 85,000 refugees. However, the numbers have decreased in recent years, with the U.S. admitting around 11,814 refugees in fiscal year 2020.

4. **Weekly comparison**: To claim that a country has taken in as many refugees in one week as Europe has in four years, the weekly intake would need to be extraordinarily high. For example, if Europe took in approximately 1 million refugees over four years, the weekly intake for the claiming country would need to be around 1 million refugees divided by the number of weeks in four years (approximately 208 weeks), which equals roughly 4,800 refugees per week.

Given the data, it is highly unlikely that any country has taken in around 4,800 refugees per week consistently over the past four years, especially considering the significant decrease in refugee admissions in countries like the United States.

According to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI) published by the Institute for Economics and Peace, Turkey has consistently ranked among the countries significantly affected by terrorism. The GTI measures the impact of terrorism in terms of the number of incidents, fatalities, injuries, and property damage. In recent years, Turkey has faced various terrorist threats from groups such as the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party), ISIS, and other extremist organizations.

While Turkey may not always be in the top few countries most affected by terrorism, it is frequently listed among the top 20 or so, indicating a significant impact.

Given this context, the claim that ""Turkey is among the countries most affected by terrorism in the world"" is supported by credible data and reports.

1. **Number of countries in the UN**: The United Nations has 193 member states, not 196. There are also two observer states: the Holy See (Vatican City) and Palestine.

2. **Permanent members of the UN Security Council**: The five permanent members of the UN Security Council are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

3. **Religious affiliation of the permanent members**:
   - **China**: Predominantly non-religious or follows traditional Chinese religions, Buddhism, and other faiths. It is not a Christian-majority country.
   - **France**: Predominantly Christian (Roman Catholic).
   - **Russia**: Predominantly Christian (Eastern Orthodox).
   - **United Kingdom**: Predominantly Christian (Anglican).
   - **United States**: Predominantly Christian (various denominations).

Given these points:
- The claim that there are 196 countries in the UN is incorrect.
- The claim that the fate of all countries is in the hands of the 5 permanent members of the UN Security Council is a matter of interpretation but is often used to describe their significant influence.
- The claim that all 5 permanent members are Christian is incorrect because China is not a Christian-majority country.

"Darbe girişimine rağmen... Döviz rezervimiz azalmak şöyle dursun, 125 milyar doların üzerine çıktı.",mostly false,tr,"Despite the coup attempt... far from decreasing, our foreign exchange reserves have exceeded 125 billion dollars.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. Whether there was indeed a coup attempt.
2. Whether the foreign exchange reserves have exceeded 125 billion dollars after the coup attempt.

Assuming the coup attempt is a known historical event, we need to focus on the foreign exchange reserves. This requires checking reliable financial data sources such as central bank reports, financial news, or international financial institutions' databases to confirm the current level of foreign exchange reserves.

If the foreign exchange reserves are indeed above 125 billion dollars, the claim would be 'True'. If they are close but not quite there, it might be 'Mostly True'. If they are significantly lower, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data at hand, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data is accurate based on a reliable source, the claim would be:

This involves checking reliable financial reports or official government data for the primary balance figures for March of the previous year and the current year.

Given that I don't have real-time access to financial databases or government reports, I can't verify these specific figures directly. However, if we assume the figures provided in the claim are accurate based on the context given, the claim would be:

- Last March: Deficit of 655 million lira
- This March: Surplus of 160 million lira

If these figures are correct, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor inaccuracies, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the figures are significantly off, it could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Without the ability to verify the exact figures, I can only provide a conditional response based on the assumption that the figures are accurate.

Cənubi Qafqazda ən çox etnik rus Azərbaycanda yaşayır,true,az,The most ethnic Russians in the South Caucasus live in Azerbaijan.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The most ethnic Russians in the South Caucasus live in Azerbaijan,"" we need to look at the population distribution of ethnic Russians in the South Caucasus region, which includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.

According to various sources, including census data and demographic studies:

1. **Azerbaijan**: The number of ethnic Russians in Azerbaijan has decreased significantly since the collapse of the Soviet Union. As of recent estimates, the Russian population in Azerbaijan is relatively small, numbering in the tens of thousands.

2. **Armenia**: The ethnic Russian population in Armenia is also quite small, with estimates suggesting a few thousand Russians living there.

3. **Georgia**: Georgia has a larger Russian population compared to Armenia and Azerbaijan. Estimates suggest that there are tens of thousands of ethnic Russians in Georgia, particularly in urban areas like Tbilisi and in regions such as Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

Given this information, it appears that Georgia has the largest population of ethnic Russians in the South Caucasus, not Azerbaijan.

Energy intensity is a measure of the energy efficiency of a nation's economy and is calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other reputable sources, Turkey's energy intensity is indeed higher than the average for OECD countries. However, the exact ratio can vary depending on the specific metrics and years considered.

As of recent data, Turkey's energy intensity is approximately 1.5 to 2 times higher than the OECD average, which means the claim is generally accurate but may not be precise in every context.

There are three constitutions in the world that include secularism: France, Ireland, and Turkey.","To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the constitutions of various countries to determine if secularism is included and if the claim accurately represents the number of such constitutions.

1. **France**: The French Constitution explicitly includes the principle of secularism (laïcité). Article 1 of the French Constitution states that France is a secular republic.

2. **Ireland**: The Irish Constitution does not explicitly mention the word ""secularism,"" but it does guarantee freedom of religion and prohibits the state from endorsing any particular religion. However, it does not explicitly declare the state as secular.

3. **Turkey**: The Turkish Constitution explicitly includes the principle of secularism. Article 2 of the Turkish Constitution states that Turkey is a secular republic.

However, there are many other countries with constitutions that include secularism or principles of separation between religion and state. Examples include India, the United States (through the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment), and Mexico, among others.

Given this information, the claim that only France, Ireland, and Turkey have constitutions that include secularism is incorrect. There are more than three countries with constitutions that include secularism.

"Buyurun İzmir’e bakalım, en büyük kent ormanı İzmir’de.",false,tr,"Let's look at İzmir, the largest urban forest is in İzmir.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""the largest urban forest is in İzmir,"" we need to consider the definition of an urban forest and compare İzmir's urban forests to those in other cities globally.

An urban forest is typically defined as a collection of trees and other vegetation in an urban area, which can include parks, street trees, and green spaces. The size of an urban forest can vary significantly from city to city.

İzmir, a major city in Turkey, is known for its green spaces and efforts to increase urban greenery. However, when considering the largest urban forests globally, cities like Johannesburg in South Africa, which boasts the world's largest man-made urban forest, and other cities with extensive green spaces such as New York's Central Park, would likely surpass İzmir in terms of the size of their urban forests.

Given this context, the claim that İzmir has the largest urban forest is not accurate when considering global comparisons.

The authorities have not prevented the citizens from gathering freely,mostly false,az,The authorities have not prevented the citizens from gathering freely.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The authorities have not prevented the citizens from gathering freely,"" we need to consider the context and any available evidence regarding the actions of the authorities in relation to citizens' gatherings.

1. **True**: This would mean there is clear and consistent evidence that authorities have not taken any actions to prevent citizens from gathering freely.
2. **Mostly True**: This would mean that, in general, authorities have not prevented gatherings, but there might be a few isolated incidents where they have.
3. **Half True**: This would mean that authorities have sometimes allowed gatherings and sometimes prevented them, with no clear pattern.
4. **Mostly False**: This would mean that, in general, authorities have prevented gatherings, but there might be a few isolated incidents where they have not.
5. **False**: This would mean there is clear and consistent evidence that authorities have taken actions to prevent citizens from gathering freely.

Without specific context or evidence, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume a hypothetical scenario where there is no evidence of authorities preventing gatherings, the claim would be:

1. **Abolishment of Censorship in 1998**: It is true that in 1998, Azerbaijan officially abolished state censorship of the media. This was a significant step towards media freedom.

2. **Legislative Framework Improvement**: There have been efforts to improve the legislative framework related to mass media in Azerbaijan. However, the effectiveness and implementation of these laws can be inconsistent.

3. **Media Independence**: Despite the official abolishment of censorship and legislative improvements, the media in Azerbaijan is not completely independent. There are numerous reports from international organizations like Reporters Without Borders and Freedom House that indicate significant government influence and control over the media. Journalists and media outlets often face harassment, legal challenges, and other forms of pressure.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also significant inaccuracies, particularly regarding the complete independence of the media.

There has been significant progress in connection with corruption in 2018,mostly false,az,There has been significant progress in connection with corruption in 2018.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There has been significant progress in connection with corruption in 2018,"" we need to consider various sources and reports from that year. 

1. **Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2018**: This index measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption worldwide. The 2018 CPI report indicated that while some countries made progress, many others either stagnated or worsened in terms of corruption. The global average score was 43 out of 100, indicating a high level of perceived corruption.

2. **Country-Specific Reports**: Some countries did make notable strides in combating corruption in 2018. For example, countries like Estonia and Botswana were highlighted for their efforts in improving transparency and reducing corruption. However, other countries, such as the United States and Brazil, faced significant corruption scandals and challenges.

3. **Global Trends**: The overall global trend in 2018 did not show a significant reduction in corruption. Many regions, particularly in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, continued to struggle with high levels of corruption.

Given this mixed picture, the claim that there has been ""significant progress"" in connection with corruption in 2018 is somewhat overstated. While there were pockets of progress, the overall global situation did not reflect significant improvement.

In Turkey, this rate is 7.5%.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Finland, 10.3% of the national income is given to retirees. In Turkey, this rate is 7.5%,"" we need to verify the specific percentages of national income allocated to retirees in both Finland and Turkey.

1. **Finland**: According to data from the OECD and other reliable sources, Finland typically allocates a significant portion of its national income to social welfare, including pensions for retirees. The exact percentage can vary slightly depending on the year and the source, but it is generally in the range of 10-12%.

2. **Turkey**: Similarly, data from the OECD and other reliable sources indicate that Turkey allocates a smaller percentage of its national income to retirees compared to Finland. The percentage is usually around 7-8%.

Given this information, the claim that Finland allocates 10.3% and Turkey allocates 7.5% of their national income to retirees is reasonably accurate, though the exact figures might slightly vary depending on the source and the year.

IMF'ye olan borcun silindiği söyleniyor ancak başka yerlere 400 milyar borç var.,true,tr,"It is said that the debt to the IMF has been forgiven, but there is a debt of 400 billion elsewhere.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The debt to the IMF has been forgiven.""
2. ""There is a debt of 400 billion elsewhere.""

1. Debt Forgiveness by the IMF:
Debt forgiveness by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a rare occurrence and typically involves specific conditions and agreements. It is not common for the IMF to completely forgive debt; instead, they may restructure or provide relief under certain programs. To verify this part of the claim, we would need specific information about the country in question and any recent agreements with the IMF.

2. Debt of 400 Billion Elsewhere:
The claim that there is a debt of 400 billion elsewhere is vague and lacks context. It is unclear whether this refers to national debt, corporate debt, or another form of debt. Additionally, without specifying the country or entity, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this figure.

Given the lack of specific information and context, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge about IMF practices and the unspecified nature of the 400 billion debt, the claim appears to be misleading.

This includes factors like venue availability, security, communication channels, and any other logistical support required for candidates to effectively meet with voters.

Without specific details or evidence to confirm that all these conditions have been met, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on a general understanding that the basic requirements are in place, we might lean towards a positive assessment.

Given the lack of specific evidence but assuming a general provision of necessary conditions, the claim can be considered as 'Mostly True'.

1. **FAO Reports**: According to the FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment, Turkey has been reported to have increased its forest area over the past few decades. The FAO data shows that Turkey has implemented successful reforestation and afforestation programs.

2. **National Forestry Reports**: Turkey's General Directorate of Forestry has also reported increases in forest cover due to national policies aimed at reforestation and sustainable forest management.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: While Turkey is not the only country increasing its forest assets, it is among a limited number of countries that have shown a consistent increase in forest cover. Other countries with similar trends include China, India, and some European nations.

Given this information, the claim that Turkey is one of the few countries in the world that can increase its forest assets is supported by credible data, though it is important to note that Turkey is not unique in this regard.

“AXCP-Müsavat iqtidarı dövründə əfv və amnistiya kimi institutlardan imtina edilmişdi”,half true,az,"""During the AXCP-Musavat administration, institutions such as pardon and amnesty were abandoned.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""During the AXCP-Musavat administration, institutions such as pardon and amnesty were abandoned,"" we need to examine historical records and policies from that period.

The AXCP-Musavat administration refers to the period in Azerbaijan's history when the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (AXCP) and the Musavat Party were in power, which was primarily during the early 1990s. Specifically, Abulfaz Elchibey, a member of the AXCP, served as President of Azerbaijan from June 1992 until June 1993.

During Elchibey's presidency, Azerbaijan faced significant political and social turmoil, including the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and internal power struggles. However, there is no substantial evidence to suggest that the institutions of pardon and amnesty were completely abandoned during this period. In fact, like many governments, the AXCP-Musavat administration likely continued to use these institutions as tools for political and social management, although the frequency and manner of their application might have varied.

Given the lack of concrete evidence supporting the claim that these institutions were entirely abandoned, it is more accurate to say that the claim is not fully supported by historical records.

1. Whether the most indebted top 5 cities in Turkey are governed by the AKP (Justice and Development Party).
2. Whether the majority of happy and livable cities in Turkey are governed by CHP (Republican People's Party) mayors, according to independent statistics.

### Step 1: Verify the Indebted Cities
- **Indebted Cities**: We need to identify the top 5 most indebted cities in Turkey and check their current mayors' party affiliations.
- **Sources**: This information can typically be found in financial reports, government publications, or reputable news sources.

### Step 2: Verify the Happy and Livable Cities
- **Happy and Livable Cities**: We need to identify cities that are ranked high in terms of happiness and livability and check their mayors' party affiliations.
- **Sources**: This information can be found in surveys and reports from independent organizations or research institutions.

### Analysis:
Without access to the latest specific data, we can only provide a general analysis based on known trends and available information up to the knowledge cutoff in October 2023.

- **Indebted Cities**: Historically, larger cities like Istanbul and Ankara, which have significant debt, have been governed by AKP mayors until recent elections where some shifted to CHP. However, the exact current top 5 most indebted cities and their party affiliations would need to be verified.
- **Happy and Livable Cities**: Surveys and reports often rank cities like Izmir, which is governed by a CHP mayor, as highly livable. However, the majority status would need to be confirmed with specific data.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and the need for specific, up-to-date data, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted without further detailed research. However, based on general trends and available information:

- It is plausible that many of the most indebted cities have been governed by AKP mayors, given their historical control over major cities.
- It is also plausible that many of the cities ranked high in happiness and livability are governed by CHP mayors, based on known examples like Izmir.

The OSCE has been involved in numerous fact-finding missions and monitoring activities in different regions, including Ukraine, Georgia, and other areas with ongoing conflicts or disputes. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, for example, has been active since 2014, which is less than 10 years ago.

Given that the OSCE has had ongoing missions in various occupied territories within the last decade, the claim that their last fact-finding mission was 10 years ago is not accurate.

It also has a net profit of around 200 million dollars.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the information provided:

1. ""The loss-making PTT has increased its revenue to over 1 billion dollars as of last year.""
2. ""It also has a net profit of around 200 million dollars.""

The first part of the claim suggests that PTT was previously making losses but has now increased its revenue to over 1 billion dollars. The second part states that PTT has a net profit of around 200 million dollars.

If PTT was previously loss-making but now has a net profit, it implies a significant turnaround in its financial performance. However, the claim contains a contradiction: it refers to PTT as ""loss-making"" while also stating it has a net profit of 200 million dollars.

Given this contradiction, the claim cannot be entirely accurate. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for this claim is 'Mostly False' because it contains some elements of truth (increased revenue and net profit) but is fundamentally misleading due to the contradictory information.

1. **Turkish Lira**: The Turkish lira has experienced significant volatility and depreciation over the past few years due to various economic factors, including high inflation, political instability, and economic policies.

2. **Avro**: The term ""Avro"" is not a recognized currency. If the intention was to refer to the ""Euro,"" then we need to consider the Euro's performance. The Euro has also experienced fluctuations, but generally, it has been more stable compared to the Turkish lira.

Given that the Turkish lira is known for its high volatility and significant depreciation, while the Euro (if that's what ""Avro"" refers to) has been relatively more stable, the claim that the Turkish lira fluctuates to the same extent as the Avro has depreciated is not accurate.

The claim states that there were approximately 256,000 theft cases in 2008 and around 600,000 theft cases in 2017, and that this increase is causing concern for society in terms of life and property security.

1. **Data Accuracy**: The numbers provided (256,000 in 2008 and 600,000 in 2017) need to be verified against reliable crime statistics sources. If these numbers are accurate, the claim about the increase in theft cases is correct.

2. **Contextual Interpretation**: The statement also claims that this increase is causing concern for society. This is a subjective interpretation but can be considered reasonable given that a significant rise in theft cases would logically lead to increased concern about security.

Without access to the exact crime statistics to verify the numbers, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim based on the provided data. Assuming the numbers are correct, the claim about societal concern is plausible.

The claim that a young Turkish person's spouse, children, mother, and father must take and pass a German language exam in order to settle in Germany is not entirely accurate. While there are language requirements for certain family members under German immigration law, there are also exemptions and specific conditions that apply, particularly for Turkish nationals due to agreements between Turkey and the European Union. For example, children under a certain age and certain family members may be exempt from the language requirement. Therefore, the blanket statement is not true.",false,False,False

1. **Source Verification**: Is there a credible source or official statement that confirms the savings of 20 million manats due to the postponement of international scientific events?
2. **Context and Details**: Are there specific details or context provided that explain how these savings were calculated? For example, were there budget reports or financial statements that support this claim?
3. **Comparison with Other Data**: Are there other similar claims or data points that either support or contradict this statement?

Without specific evidence or detailed information to verify the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some form of official report or credible source, it might lean towards being accurate. Conversely, if there is no supporting evidence, it would lean towards being inaccurate.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the most balanced approach would be to categorize it as ""Half True,"" indicating that the claim could be partially accurate but lacks sufficient verification.

Avrupa'da yüksek okullaşma oranında birinci sıradayız.,half true,tr,We are in the first place in Europe in terms of high school enrollment rate.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are in the first place in Europe in terms of high school enrollment rate,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on high school enrollment rates across European countries. This data is typically provided by organizations such as Eurostat, UNESCO, or the OECD.

As of the latest available data, no European country consistently holds the top position in high school enrollment rates across all reports and years. Countries like Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands often have high enrollment rates, but the specific ranking can vary depending on the year and the source of the data.

Without specific and up-to-date data to verify this claim, it is difficult to assert its accuracy definitively. However, based on general trends and available information, it is unlikely that any one country consistently holds the top spot.

1. The number of dams in 2002 was 195.
2. In 2002, 423 new facilities were added to the number of dams.
3. The purpose of these new facilities included energy and irrigation.
4. The number of hydroelectric power plants increased from 49 to 540.

Without access to specific historical data on the number of dams and hydroelectric power plants in 2002, it is challenging to verify the exact numbers. However, the claim seems to be quite specific and detailed, which suggests that it might be based on actual data.

The claim states that the income gap between the poorest and the richest was 9.5 times in 2002 and has improved to 7.4 times today.

1. **2002 Income Gap**: According to available data, the income gap between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% in Turkey was indeed around 9.5 times in 2002.

2. **Current Income Gap**: Recent data from sources such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) or international organizations like the World Bank or OECD would need to be checked to confirm the current income gap. If the most recent data indicates that the income gap is approximately 7.4 times, then the claim would be accurate.

Given that the claim aligns with the historical data for 2002 and assuming the current figure of 7.4 times is accurate based on recent statistics, the claim can be considered accurate.

I don’t accept the logic saying “child support is not given” in the country,mostly false,az,"I don’t accept the logic that says ""child support is not given"" in the country.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I don’t accept the logic that says 'child support is not given' in the country,"" we need to consider the general practices and legal frameworks regarding child support in most countries.

In many countries, child support is a legal obligation enforced by the government to ensure that non-custodial parents contribute financially to the upbringing of their children. This is a common practice in countries like the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many others. There are legal systems in place to enforce child support payments, and failure to comply can result in legal consequences.

However, the effectiveness and enforcement of child support can vary significantly from one country to another. In some countries, the enforcement mechanisms may be weak, and in others, cultural or economic factors might influence the prevalence and effectiveness of child support.

Given that child support is generally a recognized and enforced obligation in many countries, the claim that ""child support is not given"" is largely inaccurate.

1. **True**: The claim would be 'True' if there is clear and recent evidence showing that the country's currency reserves have indeed increased by a small amount.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim would be 'Mostly True' if the reserves have increased, but the increase is not as small as implied or if there are minor inaccuracies in the statement.
3. **Half True**: The claim would be 'Half True' if the reserves have increased, but the increase is not recent or if the increase is not as small as implied.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim would be 'Mostly False' if the reserves have not increased recently or if the increase is negligible.
5. **False**: The claim would be 'False' if the reserves have decreased or remained the same.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some recent data showing a small increase in the country's currency reserves, the most appropriate response would be:

Icharishahar is a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its historical and architectural significance. Efforts have been made to preserve its ancient structures, such as the Maiden Tower and the Palace of the Shirvanshahs.

However, like many historical sites, Icharishahar faces challenges related to urban development, tourism, and environmental factors that can impact its preservation. While significant efforts are made to maintain its beauty and historical integrity, the extent of preservation can vary.

One of the most recognized sources for such data is the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which is conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

PISA assesses 15-year-old students' reading, mathematics, and science literacy every three years. The latest available results are from the 2018 assessment. According to the PISA 2018 results, Slovakia was not at the bottom of the list in reading skills. Countries like the Philippines and the Dominican Republic were among the lowest performers in reading.

Azərbaycan sosial şəbəkələrin ən xoşagəlməz təsirlərinə məruz qalan ölkələrdən biridir,half true,az,Azerbaijan is one of the countries most affected by the negative impacts of social networks.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan is one of the countries most affected by the negative impacts of social networks,"" we need to consider several factors, including available data on social media usage, the extent of negative impacts, and comparisons with other countries.

1. **Social Media Usage**: Azerbaijan has a significant number of social media users, but it is not among the top countries in terms of social media penetration or usage.

2. **Negative Impacts**: The negative impacts of social networks can include issues like misinformation, cyberbullying, political manipulation, and mental health problems. While Azerbaijan has experienced some of these issues, they are not unique to the country and are prevalent globally.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Countries like the United States, India, and the Philippines have been reported to experience significant negative impacts from social networks, often more so than Azerbaijan. These impacts are usually measured by the extent of misinformation, political interference, and social unrest linked to social media.

Given the available information, the claim that Azerbaijan is ""one of the countries most affected"" by the negative impacts of social networks seems to be an overstatement. While Azerbaijan does face challenges related to social media, it is not uniquely or exceptionally affected compared to many other countries.

"Türkiye, ilk kez bu büyüklükte döviz rezervi erimesi yaşamıştır.",mostly true,tr,Turkey has experienced a depletion of foreign exchange reserves of this magnitude for the first time.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey has experienced a depletion of foreign exchange reserves of this magnitude for the first time,"" we need to consider historical data on Turkey's foreign exchange reserves.

Turkey has faced significant economic challenges and fluctuations in its foreign exchange reserves over the years. For instance, during the 2001 financial crisis, Turkey experienced a substantial depletion of its reserves. More recently, in 2020 and 2021, Turkey's foreign exchange reserves also saw significant declines due to various economic pressures, including efforts to stabilize the Turkish lira.

Given this historical context, it is not accurate to say that Turkey is experiencing such a depletion for the first time. There have been previous instances of significant depletion.

The ECHR handles numerous cases from various countries, including Azerbaijan, and the seriousness of these cases can vary widely.

1. **Research on ECHR Cases**: The ECHR's official website and recent reports can provide information on the number and nature of cases involving Azerbaijan. Historically, Azerbaijan has had several cases brought against it, often related to human rights issues such as freedom of expression, political imprisonment, and fair trial rights.

2. **Current Status**: As of the latest available data, it is important to check if there are any ongoing or recently adjudicated cases involving Azerbaijan that are considered serious by the ECHR.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: The term ""serious issues"" can be subjective. However, if there are any ongoing cases that involve significant human rights violations, they would typically be considered serious.

1. **Global Context**: The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant economic disruptions worldwide, causing unemployment rates to rise in many countries due to lockdowns, business closures, and reduced economic activity.

2. **Turkey's Specific Situation**: According to some reports, Turkey's official unemployment rate did show a decrease during certain periods of the pandemic. However, this decrease has been attributed to various factors, including changes in the way unemployment statistics were reported, government employment support programs, and a reduction in the labor force participation rate (i.e., fewer people actively seeking work).

3. **Comparative Analysis**: The claim that no other country in the world experienced a decrease in unemployment during the pandemic is a broad and sweeping statement. Some countries implemented extensive job retention schemes, furlough programs, and other measures that helped stabilize or even reduce unemployment rates temporarily. For example, countries like Germany and Japan had relatively stable unemployment rates due to such interventions.

Given these points, the claim that unemployment decreased in Turkey during the pandemic while this was not the case in any other country is an oversimplification and does not account for the complexities of labor market dynamics and government interventions globally.

As of my last update in October 2023, the unemployment rate in Azerbaijan has fluctuated over the years due to various economic factors. However, without access to the most current data, it is challenging to definitively confirm the exact unemployment rate at this moment.

Given that the unemployment rate in Azerbaijan has been reported to be around 5 percent in recent years, the claim could be considered reasonably accurate based on historical data trends.

"Rusya’da idam var, Azerbaycan’da da var. Avrupa Konseyi üyesi bunlar, sözleşmeye taraf.",mostly false,tr,"There is the death penalty in Russia, and there is also the death penalty in Azerbaijan. They are members of the Council of Europe and parties to the convention.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the status of the death penalty in Russia and Azerbaijan, as well as their membership in the Council of Europe and their status as parties to the European Convention on Human Rights.

1. **Death Penalty in Russia:**
   - Russia has had a moratorium on the death penalty since 1996. While the death penalty is still legally permissible, it has not been carried out since the moratorium was established.

2. **Death Penalty in Azerbaijan:**
   - Azerbaijan abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 1998.

3. **Council of Europe Membership:**
   - Both Russia and Azerbaijan are members of the Council of Europe. Russia joined in 1996, and Azerbaijan joined in 2001.

4. **European Convention on Human Rights:**
   - Both countries are parties to the European Convention on Human Rights, which includes protocols that aim to abolish the death penalty.

Given this information:
- The claim that there is a death penalty in Russia is misleading because, although it is legally permissible, it has not been practiced since 1996 due to the moratorium.
- The claim that there is a death penalty in Azerbaijan is incorrect because it was abolished in 1998.
- The claim that both countries are members of the Council of Europe and parties to the convention is accurate.

Therefore, the claim is mostly false because it inaccurately represents the status of the death penalty in both countries.

Dünyada başta kadınlar olmak üzere insanların yaşadığı en güvenli ülke olmamıza rağmen…,false,tr,"Despite being the safest country in the world, especially for women...","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Despite being the safest country in the world, especially for women,"" we need to consider various global safety indices and reports that evaluate the safety of countries, particularly for women.

1. **Global Safety Indices**: Various organizations and research bodies publish safety indices that rank countries based on different criteria such as crime rates, political stability, and personal safety. For example, the Global Peace Index, the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, and the Women's Safety Index.

2. **Women's Safety**: Specific reports and indices focus on the safety of women, such as the Women, Peace, and Security Index, which considers factors like intimate partner violence, legal discrimination, and community safety.

3. **Country Comparisons**: No single country consistently ranks as the absolute safest across all these indices. Countries like Iceland, New Zealand, and Finland often rank highly in terms of overall safety and women's safety, but the rankings can vary depending on the specific criteria and methodology used.

Given the complexity and variability in these rankings, it is unlikely that any country can be definitively labeled as ""the safest country in the world, especially for women"" without some degree of qualification or context.

BM'de temsil edilmeyen bir gücün Türkiye'den geçmesine izin verilerek Türkiye anayasal bir suç işlemektedir.,false,tr,"By allowing the passage of a power not represented in the UN through Turkey, Turkey is committing a constitutional crime.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Constitutional Law in Turkey**: The Turkish Constitution would need to explicitly prohibit the passage of foreign powers not represented in the UN through its territory for this claim to be true. 

2. **International Law and Agreements**: Turkey is a member of various international organizations and treaties, including the United Nations. The passage of foreign military forces through Turkish territory would typically be governed by international agreements and bilateral treaties rather than solely by the UN representation status of the foreign power.

3. **Context of the Passage**: The context in which the passage is allowed (e.g., humanitarian aid, military cooperation, etc.) could also affect the legality under Turkish law.

Without specific references to the Turkish Constitution or relevant legal provisions, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, based on general principles, the claim seems to overstate the constitutional implications without clear evidence.

HES Santrali’nden derelere verilen suyun oksijen oranı daha yüksektir.,false,tr,The oxygen level of the water released from the HES Power Plant into the streams is higher.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The oxygen level of the water released from the HES Power Plant into the streams is higher,"" we need to consider the typical processes and outcomes associated with hydroelectric power plants (HES stands for Hydroelectric Station).

Hydroelectric power plants often release water back into streams after it has passed through turbines. The process of water passing through turbines can increase the oxygen levels in the water due to aeration. Aeration occurs when water is agitated, which can happen as it moves through the turbines and spillways, allowing it to absorb more oxygen from the air.

However, the actual oxygen levels can vary depending on several factors, including the design of the plant, the temperature of the water, and the initial oxygen levels of the water before it enters the plant. In many cases, the oxygen level can indeed be higher after the water is released, but this is not a universal rule and can depend on specific circumstances.

Given this information, the claim is generally accurate but not universally true in all cases.

1. **Employment Creation Potential of the 90s**: This refers to the rate at which jobs were created during the 1990s. We need historical data on job creation rates from that decade.

2. **Current Unemployment Rate**: We need the current unemployment rate to compare it with the hypothetical scenario.

3. **Impact on Unemployment Rate**: The claim suggests that if the job creation potential were at the level of the 90s, the unemployment rate would rise to 14 percent. This implies a significant difference in job creation rates between the 90s and now.

4. **Number of Unemployed People**: The claim also states that there would be 3.5 million more unemployed people under the hypothetical scenario.

To verify this claim, we would need:
- Historical data on job creation rates from the 1990s.
- Current job creation rates and unemployment statistics.
- An analysis to see if the difference in job creation rates could indeed lead to an increase of 3.5 million unemployed people and a 14 percent unemployment rate.

Without specific data, we can only make an educated guess based on general trends and economic principles. Historically, the 1990s were a period of economic growth and relatively high job creation rates in many countries, particularly in the United States. If current job creation rates are significantly lower, it is plausible that the unemployment rate could be higher if we were creating jobs at the 90s rate.

However, without concrete data to back up the specific figures (14 percent unemployment rate and 3.5 million more unemployed), we cannot definitively say the claim is entirely accurate.

1. The initial number of tourists when the office was taken.
2. The current number of tourists.
3. The time frame over which this change occurred.

Without specific data or context, such as the country or the time period in question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made by a government official and we have no reason to doubt the provided figures, we can make a reasoned judgment based on typical growth patterns in tourism.

Given that the claim states an increase from 13 million to over 40 million tourists, this represents a significant growth. If such growth is plausible within the given time frame and there is no contradictory evidence, we might consider the claim to be mostly accurate.

However, without concrete data, we cannot fully verify the exact numbers. Therefore, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

1. **Historical Context**: Historically, the ratio of consumer debt to income has indeed increased significantly over the decades. However, the starting point of 4% seems unusually low. Most historical data suggest that the debt-to-income ratio was higher than 4% even in earlier decades.

2. **Current Data**: As of recent years, the debt-to-income ratio in many developed countries, including the United States, has indeed surpassed 50%. For example, in the U.S., the debt-to-income ratio has been reported to be around 100% or more in recent years.

Given these points, the claim seems to exaggerate the starting point but accurately reflects the current situation.

1. Whether Turkey is indeed heading towards a record in workplace fatalities.
2. Whether 158 workers lost their lives in August.

Without access to specific and up-to-date statistics on workplace fatalities in Turkey, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume that the information provided is based on reliable sources, we can make an educated assessment.

If the number of 158 fatalities in August is accurate and significantly higher than previous months or years, it could indicate a trend towards a record number of workplace fatalities. However, without concrete data on the overall trend and historical context, it is difficult to fully validate the claim.

Given the information provided and the need for more context, the claim appears to be plausible but not fully verifiable with the given data.

1. **UN Charter and Sovereignty**: The UN Charter emphasizes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. This supports the idea that Azerbaijan has the right to maintain its territorial integrity, which includes the return of IDPs to their homes.

2. **Right of Return**: The right of return is a principle in international law that allows individuals to return to their country of origin. This principle is supported by various international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 13) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 12).

3. **Context of Aghdam and Occupied Territories**: Aghdam and other territories were occupied during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The UN Security Council has passed resolutions (e.g., Resolutions 822, 853, 874, and 884) calling for the withdrawal of occupying forces and reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.

Given these points, the claim that ensuring the return of internally displaced persons from Aghdam and other occupied territories to their homes is a right of Azerbaijan confirmed in the UN Charter is supported by the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of return.

Sanayinin Türk ekonomisindeki payının azaldığına dair.,true,tr,There are statements from economic officials indicating that the economy is not doing well. There are also claims that the share of industry in the Turkish economy is decreasing.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. **Statements from economic officials indicating that the economy is not doing well**: This can be verified by looking at recent statements from Turkish economic officials, such as the Minister of Finance, the Central Bank Governor, or other relevant authorities. If there are multiple credible sources indicating economic struggles, this part of the claim would be supported.

2. **Claims that the share of industry in the Turkish economy is decreasing**: This can be verified by examining recent economic data from sources like the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) or international economic organizations. If data shows a decline in the industrial sector's contribution to GDP over recent years, this part of the claim would be supported.

Given the complexity and the need for up-to-date data, let's consider the general trends and statements available up to 2023:

- **Economic Performance**: Turkey has faced economic challenges, including high inflation, currency depreciation, and other macroeconomic issues. Statements from officials have acknowledged these problems, although the tone and emphasis may vary.

- **Industrial Share**: The share of industry in the Turkish economy has seen fluctuations. While there might be periods of decline, it is essential to look at the long-term trend to determine if there is a consistent decrease.

Based on the available information, it is reasonable to conclude that there are indeed statements from officials about economic difficulties, and there have been periods where the industrial share has decreased, though it may not be a consistent long-term trend.

1. Turkey's election to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
2. The number of votes Turkey received.
3. The total number of member countries in the United Nations at the time of the election.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations, and its Council elections are held periodically. The claim states that Turkey received 156 out of 172 votes from member countries of the United Nations.

As of the latest information, the United Nations has 193 member states. The ICAO Council elections involve voting by ICAO member states, not necessarily all UN member states. The number of ICAO member states is 193, the same as the UN, but not all may participate in every election.

Given the specifics of the claim, it is important to cross-check the exact number of votes Turkey received and the context of the election. If Turkey indeed received 156 votes, it would be a significant achievement, but the claim should be verified against official ICAO election results.

Without access to the exact election results from the ICAO, it is challenging to confirm the precise number of votes. However, based on the structure of ICAO elections and the typical reporting of such events, the claim seems plausible but requires verification.

1. Whether 39.5% of the budget expenditures are indeed allocated to the social sector in the current budget.
2. Whether this is the first time in the country's history that such a high percentage has been allocated to the social sector.

Without specific data on the country's historical budget allocations and the current budget details, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on accurate and verified data, we can analyze it as follows:

- If 39.5% is indeed allocated to the social sector in the current budget, that part of the claim is true.
- If this is the first time in the country's history that such a high percentage has been allocated to the social sector, that part of the claim is also true.

Given the lack of specific historical data in this context, we can only assess the claim based on the information provided.

1. ""We produced automobiles before South Korea.""
2. ""Today, South Korea has three global brands, but we do not have an automobile brand.""

1. ""We produced automobiles before South Korea"":
- The history of automobile production shows that many countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, were producing automobiles long before South Korea entered the market. South Korea's automobile industry began to develop significantly in the 1960s and 1970s, with companies like Hyundai, Kia, and Daewoo emerging as major players. Therefore, it is likely that many countries, including the one making the claim, produced automobiles before South Korea.

2. ""Today, South Korea has three global brands, but we do not have an automobile brand"":
- South Korea is home to several well-known global automobile brands, including Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis. If the country making the claim does not have a recognized global automobile brand today, this part of the statement would be accurate.

Given these points, the claim appears to be accurate in both parts.

This typically involves looking at trade statistics from government databases, international trade organizations, or reputable economic research institutions.

1. **Identify the base year and the current year**: The claim refers to a 16-year period. If we assume the current year is 2023, the base year would be 2007.

2. **Gather data**: Obtain foreign trade data (exports and imports) for the years 2007 and 2023. This data can be found in reports from sources like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), or national trade statistics from relevant government departments.

3. **Calculate the increase**: Compare the foreign trade values from 2007 to 2023. If the trade value in 2023 is 6.4 times the value in 2007, the claim is accurate.

Without access to specific data in this context, I can provide a general approach:

- **Check historical trade data**: For example, if the total foreign trade in 2007 was $1 trillion and in 2023 it is $6.4 trillion, the claim would be true.
- **Consider economic factors**: Inflation, changes in trade policies, global economic conditions, and other factors can influence trade volumes.

Given the lack of specific data in this response, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if you have access to the relevant trade data and it supports the 6.4 times increase, you can determine the accuracy accordingly.

Final Answer: Without specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if the data supports the 6.4 times increase, the answer would be 'True'.",,False,True

Turkey, which is completely dependent on foreign sources for oilseeds, must increase its production.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The duration of the AKP's time in power.
2. The increase in the total import of oilseeds and their derivatives from 2 million tons to 6.5 million tons.
3. Turkey's dependency on foreign sources for oilseeds.
4. The necessity for Turkey to increase its production of oilseeds.

1. The AKP (Justice and Development Party) has been in power in Turkey since 2002. As of 2023, this would be approximately 21 years, not 15 years. However, if the statement was made a few years ago, the 15-year duration could be accurate.

2. To verify the import figures, we would need access to specific trade data from Turkey over the specified period. If the data shows an increase from 2 million tons to 6.5 million tons, this part of the claim would be accurate.

3. Turkey's dependency on foreign sources for oilseeds is a well-documented issue. The country imports a significant portion of its oilseeds due to insufficient domestic production.

4. Given the dependency on imports, it is logical to conclude that increasing domestic production would be beneficial for Turkey.

Based on the available information:

- The AKP has been in power for more than 15 years.
- The specific import figures need verification from trade data.
- Turkey is indeed dependent on foreign sources for oilseeds.
- Increasing domestic production is a reasonable recommendation.

Given these points, the claim is mostly accurate but has some minor discrepancies, particularly with the duration of the AKP's time in power.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been a significant political figure in Turkey, serving as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as President from 2014 onwards. During his tenure, there have been substantial privatization efforts.

According to reports and data from the Turkish Privatization Administration (Özelleştirme İdaresi Başkanlığı), the total value of privatizations from 2003 to 2020 is estimated to be around $60 billion. This figure includes the sale of various state-owned enterprises, properties, and assets.

Given this information, the claim that $52 billion worth of state property was sold during Erdoğan's administration is largely consistent with the reported data, though it may not be precise to the last dollar.

1. **Historical Context**: The AK Party (Justice and Development Party) has been in power in Turkey since 2002. Over this period, Turkey has experienced various economic phases, including periods of growth and recession.

2. **Employment Data**: According to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and other economic reports, Turkey has seen significant job creation during the AK Party's tenure. However, the exact number of jobs created can vary depending on the source and the specific time frame considered.

3. **Verification**: To verify the claim, we would need to look at official employment statistics over the years the AK Party has been in power. If the cumulative job creation figures align with the stated number of 5.6 million, the claim would be accurate.

Given the long tenure of the AK Party and the general trend of job creation reported in various economic analyses, it is plausible that millions of jobs have been created. However, without precise and up-to-date data, it is challenging to confirm the exact figure of 5.6 million.

**Assessment**:
- If the figure is close to the actual number reported by reliable sources, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True'.
- If there is a significant discrepancy, it could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

Based on available information and the general trend of job creation during the AK Party's governance, the claim seems plausible but may not be exact.

This is exceptional among world economies. While unemployment, especially among the youth, has exceeded 20% in surrounding countries, Turkey has continuously increased its employment.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Workforce Increase**: The claim states that the workforce in Turkey has increased by 8 million 541 thousand over the last 13 years.
2. **Employment Increase**: The claim states that employment has increased by 7 million 750 thousand over the same period.
3. **Comparison with World Economies**: The claim suggests that this increase is exceptional compared to other world economies.
4. **Youth Unemployment in Surrounding Countries**: The claim mentions that youth unemployment in surrounding countries has exceeded 20%, while Turkey has continuously increased its employment.

### Verification:

1. **Workforce and Employment Data**:
   - According to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and other reliable sources, Turkey's labor force and employment figures have indeed shown significant growth over the past decade. However, exact numbers can vary slightly depending on the source and the specific time frame considered.

2. **Comparison with World Economies**:
   - While Turkey has seen substantial growth in employment, whether this is ""exceptional"" compared to other world economies can be subjective. Many emerging economies have also experienced significant employment growth, though Turkey's performance is notable.

3. **Youth Unemployment in Surrounding Countries**:
   - Youth unemployment rates in many surrounding countries, particularly in the Middle East and Southern Europe, have indeed been high, often exceeding 20%. For example, countries like Greece and Spain have faced youth unemployment rates well above 20% in recent years.

4. **Continuous Increase in Employment**:
   - Turkey has generally seen an upward trend in employment, although there have been fluctuations due to economic challenges, political instability, and global events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Conclusion:
The claim is largely accurate but may slightly overstate the ""exceptional"" nature of Turkey's employment growth compared to other world economies. The specific figures for workforce and employment increase are plausible based on available data.

"KOSGEB bütçesine ayrılan kaynağı bir önceki yıla göre yüzde 60 arttırarak 1,7 milyar liraya çıkardık.",half true,tr,"We increased the budget allocated to KOSGEB by 60% compared to the previous year, raising it to 1.7 billion liras.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The budget allocated to KOSGEB in the previous year.
2. The percentage increase and the final budget amount for the current year.

Let's break down the claim:

- The current year's budget for KOSGEB is stated to be 1.7 billion liras.
- The claim states that this is a 60% increase from the previous year.

To verify this, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Previous Year's Budget} \times (1 + \frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}) = \text{Current Year's Budget} \]

Given:
- Current Year's Budget = 1.7 billion liras
- Percentage Increase = 60%

Let's denote the previous year's budget as \( P \).

\[ P \times (1 + \frac{60}{100}) = 1.7 \text{ billion liras} \]
\[ P \times 1.6 = 1.7 \text{ billion liras} \]
\[ P = \frac{1.7 \text{ billion liras}}{1.6} \]
\[ P = 1.0625 \text{ billion liras} \]

So, the previous year's budget should have been approximately 1.0625 billion liras.

To confirm the claim, we need to check if the previous year's budget was indeed around 1.0625 billion liras. If it was, then the claim is accurate.

Assuming the previous year's budget was indeed 1.0625 billion liras, the claim would be:

- The budget increased by 60% from 1.0625 billion liras to 1.7 billion liras.

Given this calculation and assuming the previous year's budget figure is correct, the claim is accurate.

1. **Initial Debt in 2002**: $130 billion
2. **Debt in the first half of 2016**: $421.4 billion

To calculate the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Final Value} - \text{Initial Value}}{\text{Initial Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{421.4 - 130}{130} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{291.4}{130} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 2.24 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 224.92\% \]

The claim states that Turkey's external debt increased by 225.2 percent, which is very close to the calculated 224.92 percent. Given the slight rounding difference, the claim is very accurate.

1. The G20's development target.
2. Turkey's average growth rate.

1. **G20's Development Target:**
   The G20 does not have a single, fixed development target for economic growth. The G20 is a forum for international economic cooperation, and its member countries have various economic goals and targets. However, in 2014, the G20 set a goal to lift the collective GDP of its members by an additional 2% over five years, which is often referred to as the ""2% growth target."" This was a one-time target and not an ongoing annual target.

2. **Turkey's Average Growth Rate:**
   Turkey's economic growth rate has varied significantly over the years. According to data from the World Bank and other economic sources, Turkey's GDP growth rate has fluctuated, but it has often been higher than the average growth rate of many other G20 countries. For instance, Turkey's GDP growth rate was around 7.4% in 2021, but it has also experienced periods of lower growth and even contraction in some years.

Given these points, the claim that ""The G20's development target is 2%, while Turkey is growing at an average of 5%"" is somewhat misleading. The G20's 2% target was a specific goal set for a particular period and not an ongoing target. Additionally, while Turkey has experienced high growth rates, the average growth rate of 5% may not accurately reflect the variability in its economic performance over different years.

3. **General Practice**: While it is a good practice for electoral bodies to announce procedural violations, it is not guaranteed that they always do so. The claim assumes a level of transparency that may not always be present.

Given these considerations, the claim is an overgeneralization and does not account for the variability in practices among different electoral bodies.

Türkiye’de öğretmenler yoksulluk sınırının altında bir ücrete yaşamaya mahkûm edilmektedir.,half true,tr,Teachers in Turkey are being condemned to live on a salary below the poverty line.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Teachers in Turkey are being condemned to live on a salary below the poverty line,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Salary Data**: We need to look at the average salary of teachers in Turkey and compare it to the national poverty line.
2. **Poverty Line Definition**: The poverty line can vary depending on the source and the criteria used (e.g., World Bank, national statistics).
3. **Cost of Living**: The cost of living in Turkey, including housing, food, transportation, and other essentials, should be considered to understand if the salary is sufficient to meet basic needs.

### Analysis:

1. **Teacher Salaries**: According to recent data, the average monthly salary for a teacher in Turkey varies but is generally around 5,000 to 7,000 Turkish Lira (TRY). This can fluctuate based on experience, location, and level of education.

2. **Poverty Line**: The poverty line in Turkey, as defined by various sources, is approximately 2,500 to 3,000 TRY per month for a single individual. For a family, this number would be higher.

3. **Cost of Living**: The cost of living in Turkey has been rising, especially with recent economic challenges and inflation. Essential expenses such as rent, food, and utilities have increased, making it harder for individuals and families to make ends meet.

### Conclusion:

Given the average salary of teachers and the defined poverty line, it appears that while teachers may not be living in absolute poverty, their salaries are relatively low compared to the cost of living. This situation can lead to financial strain and challenges in maintaining a decent standard of living.

This information is typically available from educational statistics provided by government agencies, educational institutions, or reputable research organizations.

Without access to the latest data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data is accurate and up-to-date, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the number is slightly off but still close to 1.5 million, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the number is significantly different, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

"Bu illər ərzində iqtisadi, sosial sahədə maaşlar, pensiyalar on dəfədən çox artıb",half true,az,"Over the years, salaries and pensions in the economic and social sectors have increased more than tenfold.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Over the years, salaries and pensions in the economic and social sectors have increased more than tenfold,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Time Frame**: The claim does not specify a particular time frame. The interpretation of ""over the years"" could vary significantly, affecting the assessment.
2. **Economic and Social Sectors**: These sectors can include a wide range of professions and industries, each with different salary and pension growth rates.
3. **Inflation and Economic Conditions**: Inflation rates and economic conditions over the specified period can significantly impact salary and pension increases.
4. **Geographical Context**: The claim does not specify a country or region, which is crucial as economic conditions and growth rates vary widely across different areas.

Without specific data or a defined time frame, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, a tenfold increase in salaries and pensions is quite substantial and would typically require a very long period or extremely high inflation rates.

Given the lack of specificity and the general improbability of such a significant increase across all economic and social sectors without more context, the claim seems exaggerated.

Aynı şekilde kişi başına düşen milli gelir bakımından bulunduğumuz 64. sıranın da gerçeği yansıtmadığını düşünüyorum.,true,tr,"Turkey is the 13th largest country in the world in terms of purchasing power. Similarly, I believe that our position of 64th in terms of per capita national income does not reflect the reality.","To evaluate the claim, we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on Turkey's ranking in terms of purchasing power and per capita national income.

1. **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):**
   According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Turkey is often ranked around the 13th to 20th largest economy in the world when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). This can vary slightly depending on the year and the specific source, but it is generally in that range.

2. **Per Capita National Income:**
   For per capita national income, Turkey is typically ranked much lower. According to the World Bank and IMF data, Turkey's ranking in terms of GDP per capita (PPP) is usually around the 60th to 70th position. This ranking can also vary slightly depending on the year and the specific source.

Given this information:

- The claim that Turkey is the 13th largest country in the world in terms of purchasing power is generally accurate.
- The claim that Turkey's position of 64th in terms of per capita national income does not reflect the reality is more subjective. However, the ranking itself is based on standardized international metrics, so it does reflect the reality as measured by those metrics.

1. **Turkey**: According to various sources, including reports from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and other educational research, the proportion of female faculty members in Turkish universities has been reported to be around 40-45% in recent years. This suggests that the figure of 29.5% is significantly lower than the actual reported statistics.

2. **European Union**: According to the She Figures report by the European Commission, which provides data on gender equality in research and innovation, the proportion of female faculty members in the EU is generally higher than 15%. The average proportion of female academic staff in the EU is closer to 40%, though this can vary significantly between different countries within the EU.

Given this information, the claim that the proportion of female faculty members is around 29.5% in Turkey and approximately 15% in the European Union is not accurate based on the most recent and reliable data.

1. **Current Youth Unemployment Rate**: The claim states that youth unemployment is at 27.4%. We need to check the most recent data from TÜİK to confirm this figure.

2. **Historical Comparison**: The claim asserts that this is the highest youth unemployment rate ever recorded since TÜİK started publishing statistics. This requires a historical review of TÜİK's data on youth unemployment rates.

3. **Overall Unemployment Rate**: The claim also mentions that overall unemployment is at its highest rate. This needs to be verified against historical data from TÜİK.

Without access to the most recent and historical data from TÜİK, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume the data provided in the claim is accurate, we can make an informed judgment.

Given the specificity of the numbers and the historical context provided, if the data aligns with TÜİK's records, the claim would likely be accurate. However, without direct verification, we should consider the possibility of slight inaccuracies or context that might affect the interpretation.

1. **Global Context**: During global crises, such as economic recessions or pandemics, many countries do indeed cut back on various expenditures, including Research and Development (R&D).

2. **Country-Specific Data**: The claim is about a specific country continuing to increase its R&D expenditures while others were cutting back. To verify this, we would need data on R&D spending trends for the country in question during the specified global crisis period.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: We would also need to compare this country's R&D spending trends with those of other countries during the same period to see if there was a general trend of cutting back on R&D expenditures globally.

Without specific data and context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on a well-documented trend for a specific country known for maintaining or increasing R&D spending during global crises (e.g., South Korea, Germany, or the United States in certain periods), we can make an educated assessment.

Given the general trend that some countries do maintain or even increase R&D spending during crises while others cut back, the claim could be considered plausible but not universally applicable without specific data.

1. **Specific Changes to the Tax Code**: The nature of the changes proposed or enacted in the tax code is crucial. Are these changes aimed at reducing income tax rates, increasing deductions, or providing new credits specifically for private sector employees?

2. **Scope and Impact**: The term ""significantly reduce"" implies a substantial decrease in the tax burden. We need to evaluate the magnitude of the tax reduction and how it compares to the current tax burden.

3. **Target Group**: The claim specifically mentions private sector employees. We need to verify if the changes are targeted at this group or if they apply more broadly to all taxpayers, including public sector employees, self-employed individuals, and others.

4. **Economic Context**: The overall economic context, including inflation, wage growth, and other economic policies, can influence the real impact of tax code changes on private sector employees.

Without specific details on the changes to the tax code, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the changes are indeed aimed at reducing taxes for private sector employees and are substantial enough to be considered significant, the claim could be seen as ""Mostly True."" Conversely, if the changes are minor or not specifically targeted at private sector employees, the claim could be ""Half True"" or even ""Mostly False.""

1. **Annual Plastic Production in Turkey**: The claim states that Turkey produces 8.6 million tons of plastic annually. According to various sources, Turkey is indeed one of the largest producers of plastic in Europe, with production figures around this range.

2. **Plastic Waste Imports in 2018**: The claim mentions that Turkey imported 20 thousand tons of plastic waste per month in 2018. This would total 240 thousand tons for the year. Reports from environmental organizations and news articles around that time confirm that Turkey was importing significant amounts of plastic waste, with figures aligning closely to this claim.

3. **Recycling Rate**: The claim states that only 1% of the imported plastic waste is recycled. This figure seems quite low. According to various reports, Turkey has faced challenges with recycling, but the recycling rate is generally reported to be higher than 1%. However, the exact percentage can vary based on the source and the type of plastic waste.

1. **Ahmet Necdet Sezer**: Served as President of Turkey from 2000 to 2007. The claim states he spent 167.4 million lira in 7 years.
2. **Abdullah Gül**: Served as President of Turkey from 2007 to 2014. The claim states he spent 722 million lira in 7 years.
3. **Recep Tayyip Erdoğan**: Became President in 2014. The claim states he spent 2.8 billion lira in 1.5 years.

To verify these figures, we would need access to official budget records or credible sources that detail the expenditures of the Turkish presidency during these periods. Without access to these specific records, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the exact numbers provided in the claim.

However, based on general knowledge and available public information, it is known that presidential expenditures have increased significantly over time, particularly under Erdoğan's administration, due to various factors including inflation, increased security measures, and expanded presidential activities.

Given the significant increase in the figures mentioned for Erdoğan compared to his predecessors, and considering the general trend of rising expenditures, the claim appears to reflect a substantial increase in spending. However, without precise verification, the exact numbers cannot be confirmed.

Türkiye baklagillerde net ithalatçı ülke durumundadır.,true,tr,Turkey is a net importer of legumes.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Turkey is a net importer of legumes,"" we need to look at Turkey's trade balance for legumes. A net importer means that the country imports more legumes than it exports.

Turkey is known for its significant agricultural production, including legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, and beans. Historically, Turkey has been one of the leading producers and exporters of certain legumes, particularly lentils and chickpeas. However, the situation can vary year by year based on domestic production, consumption needs, and international market conditions.

Recent data and reports indicate that Turkey has faced fluctuations in its legume production due to various factors such as climate conditions and changes in agricultural practices. These fluctuations can lead to periods where Turkey might import more legumes to meet domestic demand.

Given this context, the claim that ""Turkey is a net importer of legumes"" may not be consistently true every year. It would be more accurate to say that Turkey can be a net importer of certain legumes in specific years, depending on the balance between its production and consumption.

This involves checking reliable sources such as government reports, official statistics, or credible news articles from that period.

1. **Agricultural Support in 2017**: The claim states that 12.7 billion lira was provided in support to the agricultural sector in 2017. This can be verified through official government publications or reports from the Ministry of Agriculture or equivalent authority in the country in question.

2. **Import Payments in 2017**: The claim also states that 20.6 billion lira was paid for the import of 8 products during the same period. This information can be cross-checked with trade statistics, import/export data, or reports from relevant trade authorities.

Without access to these specific sources and data, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the figures are based on official reports or credible sources, the claim could be considered accurate.

1. ""Consumer credit is a bank credit card debt trap.""
2. ""The number of our citizens in debt is 5 million.""

### Part 1: ""Consumer credit is a bank credit card debt trap.""
- This statement is subjective and can be interpreted in various ways. Some people may view consumer credit, particularly credit card debt, as a trap due to high-interest rates and the potential for accumulating unmanageable debt. However, others may see it as a useful financial tool when used responsibly. Therefore, this part of the claim is more of an opinion rather than a factual statement.

### Part 2: ""The number of our citizens in debt is 5 million.""
- This part of the claim is a factual statement that can be verified with data. The accuracy of this statement depends on the specific country being referred to and the most recent statistics available. For example, in the United States, the number of people with credit card debt is significantly higher than 5 million. In smaller countries, the number might be closer to or even less than 5 million.

The PKK is a Kurdish militant and political organization that has been involved in an armed struggle against the Turkish state for several decades. 

There have been periods of ceasefire and peace talks between the PKK and the Turkish government, most notably around 2013-2015. However, these ceasefires have often been fragile and have broken down, leading to renewed violence. 

To verify the specific claim about the PKK not firing a bullet for two years, we would need to look at recent reports and data on PKK activities. If there have been any documented incidents of violence or armed conflict involving the PKK within the last two years, the claim would be false. Conversely, if there is substantial evidence that the PKK has indeed refrained from armed activities for two years, the claim could be considered true.

Given the complexity and the ongoing nature of the conflict, it is challenging to assert with certainty without specific and up-to-date information. However, based on the general knowledge of the PKK's activities and the likelihood of sporadic violence, it is improbable that the PKK has completely refrained from armed activities for two years.

1. **COVID-19 Pandemic**: As of the latest information, COVID-19 continues to be a concern worldwide. While some countries have managed to control the spread more effectively than others, the virus has not been completely eradicated in any country. Efforts such as vaccination campaigns, public health measures, and monitoring for new variants are ongoing globally.

2. **Other Viral Threats**: Beyond COVID-19, there are other viruses that countries continuously fight against, such as influenza, HIV, hepatitis, and emerging viral threats like Ebola or Zika. Public health systems worldwide are in a constant state of vigilance and response to various viral threats.

Given this context, the claim that ""There is no country in the world where the fight against the virus is not ongoing"" is broadly accurate. Every country has some level of ongoing effort to combat viral infections, whether it be through public health measures, vaccination programs, or monitoring and responding to outbreaks.

1. **European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)**: This court deals with violations of the European Convention on Human Rights. It does not typically ""acquit"" individuals in the same way a criminal court would. Instead, it rules on whether a member state has violated the rights of an individual.

2. **Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)**: This court interprets EU law to ensure it is applied uniformly across EU member states. It also does not function as a criminal court that acquits or convicts individuals.

1. **Global Employment Trends Since 2008**: The claim states that employment has been declining and unemployment has been rising everywhere in the world since 2008. This is a broad generalization. The global financial crisis of 2008 did lead to significant job losses and increased unemployment in many countries. However, the recovery period saw varying trends in different regions. Some countries experienced job growth and declining unemployment rates post-recovery.

2. **Creation of 6 Million New Jobs**: The claim asserts that despite the global trend, 6 million new jobs have been created. This part of the claim could be true for a specific company, industry, or region, but it does not necessarily contradict the overall global employment trends.

Given the broad and somewhat misleading nature of the first part of the claim, and the specific but uncontextualized second part, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth.

Specifically, we need to examine the turnover rate of members of parliament (MPs) between different election cycles.

Azerbaijan's parliamentary elections are held every five years. The turnover rate can be influenced by various factors, including political dynamics, party policies, and electoral reforms. 

If historical data shows that the percentage of new MPs entering the parliament in each election cycle consistently falls within the 40-50% range, then the claim would be considered accurate. However, if the turnover rate significantly deviates from this range, the claim would be less accurate.

Without specific historical data at hand, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge and trends in parliamentary elections, a turnover rate of 40-50% is plausible but not guaranteed.

Çin koronavirus dövründə öz iqtisadiyyatını inkişaf etdirdi,false,az,China developed its economy during the coronavirus period.,"To evaluate the claim that ""China developed its economy during the coronavirus period,"" we need to consider several factors, including economic data, government policies, and overall economic performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1. **Economic Growth**: China was one of the few major economies to report positive GDP growth in 2020. According to official data, China's economy grew by 2.3% in 2020, despite the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic.

2. **Government Policies**: The Chinese government implemented various measures to stimulate the economy, including fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, and support for businesses. These measures helped mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.

3. **Industrial Production and Exports**: China saw a relatively quick recovery in industrial production and exports. By the second half of 2020, many sectors had returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity.

4. **Challenges and Disparities**: Despite overall growth, certain sectors and regions within China faced significant challenges. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the service sector were particularly hard-hit. Additionally, there were disparities in economic recovery across different regions.

Considering these points, the claim that ""China developed its economy during the coronavirus period"" is supported by evidence of overall economic growth and recovery measures, although it is important to acknowledge the challenges and disparities that existed.

About a quarter of that number leave every year, but compared to the previous year, there is a significant decrease in the crossings from Turkey to Europe.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. The number of illegal immigrants leaving Turkey.
2. The proportion of that number leaving every year.
3. The comparison of the current year's crossings from Turkey to Europe with the previous year.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is based on available data, we can analyze it as follows:

- If about a quarter of illegal immigrants leave Turkey every year, this would need to be supported by migration statistics.
- A significant decrease in crossings from Turkey to Europe compared to the previous year would also need to be verified with recent migration data.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, the claim appears to be partially verifiable but lacks specific figures and context.

1. **True**: If the data shows that currency reserves have consistently increased or remained stable during difficult years.
2. **Mostly True**: If the reserves have generally increased or remained stable, with only minor or short-term decreases.
3. **Half True**: If the reserves have increased in some difficult years but decreased in others.
4. **Mostly False**: If the reserves have generally decreased, with only minor or short-term increases.
5. **False**: If the reserves have consistently decreased during difficult years.

Without specific data, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume the claim is being made by a credible source and there is no significant evidence to the contrary, we might lean towards a positive assessment.

Altyapı yatırımları noktasında dünyada ikinci sırada olan müteahhitlerimizin yapacağı çok şey olduğuna inanıyorum.,half true,tr,"I believe that our contractors, who are ranked second in the world in terms of infrastructure investments, have a lot to accomplish.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the ranking of contractors in terms of infrastructure investments globally. This involves checking reliable sources such as industry reports, global rankings, and data from reputable organizations.

1. **Global Rankings**: Various organizations and reports rank countries and their contractors based on infrastructure investments. For example, the Global Infrastructure Hub, McKinsey Global Institute, and other industry-specific reports provide such rankings.

2. **Current Data**: As of the latest available data, China and the United States are often cited as leading countries in infrastructure investments. Other countries like Japan, Germany, and India also have significant investments in infrastructure.

3. **Contractor Rankings**: The ranking of contractors specifically can differ from overall country rankings. For instance, Engineering News-Record (ENR) publishes annual lists of top global contractors based on revenue from infrastructure projects.

Given the complexity and variability of such rankings, without specific and up-to-date data confirming that the contractors in question are indeed ranked second globally, it is challenging to definitively label the claim as 'True'.

**Evaluation**:
- If the claim is based on a specific, credible source that ranks contractors second globally, it could be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If there is no such specific ranking or if the ranking is outdated or incorrect, the claim could be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

**Conclusion**:
Without concrete evidence or a specific source to verify the claim, it is prudent to consider it as not fully accurate.

222 dış temsilcilikle dünyada en fazla temsil edilen 7. büyük ülke Türkiye,mostly true,tr,"With 222 foreign missions, Turkey is the 7th most represented country in the world.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""With 222 foreign missions, Turkey is the 7th most represented country in the world,"" we need to verify the number of foreign missions Turkey has and compare it to other countries.

As of the latest available data, Turkey indeed has a significant number of foreign missions, including embassies, consulates, and permanent missions to international organizations. However, the exact ranking can fluctuate based on the opening or closing of missions by various countries.

According to the Global Diplomacy Index by the Lowy Institute, which tracks the number of diplomatic missions maintained by countries around the world, Turkey has been consistently ranked among the top countries in terms of diplomatic representation. However, the exact position (7th) may vary slightly depending on the most recent data and the criteria used for counting missions.

Given that Turkey is indeed one of the most represented countries globally but the exact ranking might not always be 7th, the claim is generally accurate but not precise.

Minimum wage has increased 5 times during the past 10 years in Azerbaijan,mostly false,az,Minimum wage has increased 5 times during the past 10 years in Azerbaijan.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the minimum wage has increased 5 times during the past 10 years in Azerbaijan, we need to look at historical data on minimum wage changes in the country over the specified period.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, the minimum wage in Azerbaijan has indeed seen several increases over the past decade. For instance:
- In 2013, the minimum wage was increased.
- In 2017, there was another increase.
- In 2019, the minimum wage was raised twice.
- In 2020, there was another increase.

This totals to five increases over the past 10 years, which aligns with the claim.

Specifically, we need to verify Turkey's global and European economic rankings at the time the party came to power and its current rankings.

1. **Global Ranking:**
   - When the party came to power (2002), Turkey was ranked around 21st-22nd in the world economy based on GDP (nominal).
   - As of recent data, Turkey is ranked around 19th-20th in the world economy based on GDP (nominal).

2. **European Ranking:**
   - In 2002, Turkey was not among the top 10 largest economies in Europe.
   - Currently, Turkey is often ranked around 7th-8th largest economy in Europe based on GDP (nominal).

Given these points:
- The claim that Turkey was ranked 26th in the world economy when the party came to power is not accurate; it was closer to 21st-22nd.
- The claim that Turkey is now the 16th largest economic power in the world is also not accurate; it is around 19th-20th.
- The claim that Turkey is the 6th largest economic power in Europe is slightly exaggerated; it is around 7th-8th.

Therefore, the claim contains some elements of truth but is largely exaggerated or inaccurate.

In some countries, governments have enacted laws and policies that protect the rights of homosexuals and actively work to prevent discrimination. In other countries, however, governments may have laws that discriminate against homosexuals, or they may fail to protect them from discrimination and violence.

Given the global context and the fact that there are still many places where governmental discrimination against homosexuals exists, the claim cannot be universally true.

They increased the purchase price of corn because they can no longer import it from abroad. When input prices have increased by 100%, how will a 25% increase help solve any problem?","To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. ""There is no situation that can be called 'good news.'""
   - This is a subjective statement and cannot be objectively verified as true or false. It reflects an opinion rather than a fact.

2. ""They increased the purchase price of corn because they can no longer import it from abroad.""
   - This statement can be true if there are indeed restrictions or issues preventing the import of corn, leading to an increase in domestic prices. However, without specific context or data, we cannot definitively verify this.

3. ""When input prices have increased by 100%, how will a 25% increase help solve any problem?""
   - This statement suggests that a 25% increase in the purchase price of corn is insufficient to offset a 100% increase in input prices. Mathematically, if input prices have doubled (100% increase), a 25% increase in the purchase price of corn may not fully compensate for the increased costs, which is a reasonable argument.

Given the mix of subjective opinion and reasonable argument based on economic principles, the claim is not entirely factual but has elements of truth in its reasoning.

1. The number of foreign partnerships in Turkey in 2002 was 4,400.
2. The number of foreign partnerships in Turkey today is around 60,000.

According to data from the Turkish Ministry of Trade and other reliable sources, the number of foreign partnerships in Turkey has indeed seen significant growth over the past two decades. In 2002, the number of foreign companies operating in Turkey was approximately 4,400. Recent reports and statistics indicate that the number of foreign companies in Turkey has grown to around 60,000.

"Sanayi, ağır sanayi, yerli sanayi... Şu an Türkiye üretmiyor, borca dayalı tüketim içerisinde.",false,tr,"Industry, heavy industry, domestic industry... Currently, Turkey is not producing; it is engaged in debt-based consumption.","To evaluate the claim that ""Turkey is not producing; it is engaged in debt-based consumption,"" we need to consider several factors, including Turkey's industrial output, economic indicators, and debt levels.

1. **Industrial Output**: Turkey has a diverse industrial sector, including automotive, textiles, electronics, and machinery. According to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute and other economic reports, Turkey continues to have significant industrial production. For example, the automotive industry is one of the largest in Europe, and Turkey is a major exporter of textiles and electronics.

2. **Economic Indicators**: Turkey's GDP growth has been volatile, but the country has shown periods of significant economic growth. However, it has also faced economic challenges, including high inflation and currency depreciation.

3. **Debt Levels**: Turkey has experienced increasing levels of both public and private debt. The country has had to rely on external borrowing to finance its deficits, and this has led to concerns about debt sustainability. The Turkish lira has also faced significant depreciation, which has exacerbated debt repayment issues.

4. **Consumption Patterns**: There has been a trend of increased consumption in Turkey, partly fueled by credit expansion. This has led to concerns about the sustainability of growth driven by consumption rather than production.

Given these points, the claim that Turkey is ""not producing"" is an overstatement, as the country does have a substantial industrial base and continues to produce goods for both domestic use and export. However, the concern about debt-based consumption is valid, as Turkey has seen rising debt levels and consumption patterns that are not fully supported by domestic production.

1. **Life Expectancy at Birth**: This is a statistical measure indicating the average number of years a newborn is expected to live, assuming that current mortality rates remain constant throughout their lifetime.

2. **OECD Countries**: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organization with 38 member countries, most of which are high-income economies with a high Human Development Index (HDI).

3. **Comparison with the Country in Question**: The claim states that the country in question has not reached the life expectancy at birth of OECD countries and is not expected to reach it in its current state.

To evaluate this claim, we would need to:

- Compare the life expectancy at birth of the country in question with the average life expectancy at birth of OECD countries.
- Assess whether there are projections or expert opinions indicating that the country is not expected to reach the OECD average in its current state.

Without specific data, we can make a general assessment based on known trends:

- Many non-OECD countries, especially those with lower income levels or higher rates of poverty, often have lower life expectancies compared to OECD countries.
- If the country in question is a developing nation or has significant health, economic, or social challenges, it is plausible that its life expectancy at birth is lower than the OECD average and may not be expected to reach it soon.

Given these considerations, the claim seems plausible but would need specific data for a precise evaluation. However, based on general trends and the context provided:

1. **Data Source**: Reliable sources such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States or similar organizations in other countries provide annual reports on traffic fatalities.

2. **Trend Analysis**: We need to compare the number of traffic fatalities from 15 years ago to the most recent data available. For instance, if the number of fatalities was 40,000 fifteen years ago and is now 28,000, this would represent a 30% reduction.

3. **Contextual Factors**: Consider any significant changes in traffic laws, vehicle safety standards, or other factors that could have influenced the reduction in fatalities.

Without specific data at hand, we can only hypothesize based on general trends. Historically, many developed countries have seen a decline in traffic fatalities due to improved vehicle safety, better road infrastructure, and stricter traffic laws.

Given these considerations, if the trend data supports a significant reduction in traffic fatalities over the past 15 years, the claim could be considered accurate. However, without exact figures, we should be cautious.

If the increase in unemployment is minimal or within a margin that is generally considered insignificant, the claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True.' Conversely, if the increase is substantial or statistically significant, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False.'

Without specific data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the phrasing ""not very noticeable,"" it suggests a subjective assessment that the change is minor.

1. **Historical Context**: The AK Party (Justice and Development Party) came to power in Turkey in 2002. We need to check the tourism statistics from around that time.
2. **Tourism Statistics**: According to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism:
   - In the early 2000s, Turkey received approximately 11-12 million tourists annually.
   - By 2014, the number of tourists visiting Turkey had increased to around 36 million.
3. **Impact of Policies**: The AK Party implemented various policies to boost tourism, including infrastructure development, marketing campaigns, and improving international relations.

Given this information, the claim that the number of tourists increased from around 11-12 million to 36 million during the AK Party's tenure is supported by the data.

If the participation rates in bar association elections consistently fall within the 40%-45% range and occasionally reach up to 50%, the claim would be accurate. However, if the rates are significantly different, the claim would be less accurate.

Assuming we have data showing that participation rates are indeed within the 40%-45% range and sometimes reach up to 50%, the claim would be 'True'. If the rates are generally within this range but not always, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the rates are sometimes within this range but often outside it, it could be 'Half True'. If the rates rarely fall within this range, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data to confirm or refute the claim, we can only make a reasoned judgment based on the information provided. Given the phrasing ""around 40%-45%, at most approximately 50%,"" it suggests a general trend rather than an absolute statement.

1. **Project Details**: The project referred to is likely the ""Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project,"" which aims to transfer water from Turkey to Northern Cyprus (TRNC) via an undersea pipeline. This project was completed in 2015 and is designed to supply drinking and irrigation water.

2. **Capacity and Projections**: The pipeline has a capacity of delivering approximately 75 million cubic meters of water annually. This amount is intended to meet the current and future water needs of Northern Cyprus, including drinking water, until 2050.

3. **Sustainability and Challenges**: While the project is designed to meet the water needs, factors such as maintenance, political stability, and environmental changes could impact its long-term success. However, the claim is based on the project's design and intended capacity.

Given the information available, the claim that the project will meet all of the TRNC's drinking water needs by 2050 is based on the project's current capacity and projections. However, it does not account for potential future challenges that could affect its success.

"Biz Rusya’nın bir numaralı doğalgaz tüketicisiyiz. Türkiye, gerektiğinde doğalgazı çok farklı yerlerden temin yoluna da gidebilir.",false,tr,We are Russia's number one natural gas consumer. Turkey can also seek to procure natural gas from very different sources when necessary.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. Whether Turkey is Russia's number one natural gas consumer.
2. Whether Turkey can seek to procure natural gas from different sources when necessary.

1. **Turkey as Russia's number one natural gas consumer:**
   - As of recent data, the largest consumers of Russian natural gas are typically European countries, with Germany historically being one of the largest importers. Turkey is indeed a significant consumer of Russian natural gas, but it is not the largest. Other countries in Europe, such as Germany and Italy, have traditionally imported more Russian gas than Turkey.

2. **Turkey's ability to procure natural gas from different sources:**
   - Turkey has been diversifying its natural gas sources. It imports gas from countries like Azerbaijan, Iran, and through LNG (liquefied natural gas) from various global suppliers. Turkey has also been investing in infrastructure to support this diversification, such as LNG terminals and pipelines like TANAP (Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline).

Given these points, the claim that Turkey is Russia's number one natural gas consumer is not accurate, but the claim that Turkey can seek to procure natural gas from different sources is accurate.

Barmek Holding is a Turkish company that was involved in the management of electricity distribution in certain regions, such as Azerbaijan. There have been various reports and controversies regarding their performance and management practices. However, the term ""completely destroyed"" is quite strong and implies total and absolute failure or ruin.

Given that there might be criticisms and issues related to Barmek's management, but not necessarily to the extent of ""completely destroying"" the energy sector, the claim seems exaggerated.

1. **Agricultural Growth Data**: We need to look at the actual growth statistics in the agricultural sector over the past 15 years. This includes metrics like crop yields, production volumes, and economic value.

2. **Comparison with Other Sectors**: The claim also states that this growth is comparable to growth in ""every other area."" This requires an analysis of growth in other sectors such as technology, manufacturing, services, etc.

3. **Economic Reports and Studies**: Reliable sources such as government reports, economic studies, and data from international organizations like the World Bank or FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) can provide insights into these growth metrics.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general trends and available information:

- **Agricultural Growth**: While there has been significant growth in agriculture in many regions, a 3-4 times increase over 15 years is quite substantial and may not be universally applicable.
- **Other Sectors**: Growth in sectors like technology and services has often outpaced agricultural growth, especially in developing economies.

Given these considerations, the claim seems to be an overstatement, particularly the part about growth being uniform across all sectors.

This would mean that every single member of the previous administration has been replaced with new individuals.

If the entire administration has been replaced, the claim would be 'True'. If most but not all members have been replaced, it would be 'Mostly True'. If about half have been replaced, it would be 'Half True'. If only a few members have been replaced, it would be 'Mostly False'. If no significant changes have been made, it would be 'False'.

Without specific information on the composition of the Presidential Administration, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the phrasing ""completely new composition,"" it suggests a total overhaul, which is a rare occurrence.

1. High-tech products make up one-third of Israel's exports to China.
2. The proportion of high-tech products in the overall exports of the country making the claim is not even five percent.

Let's break down the claim:

1. **High-tech products make up one-third of Israel's exports to China**: According to various reports and trade data, Israel's high-tech sector is a significant part of its exports, especially to countries like China. It is plausible that high-tech products could constitute a substantial portion of Israel's exports to China, potentially around one-third.

2. **The proportion of high-tech products in our exports is not even five percent**: This part of the claim suggests that the overall exports of the country making the claim (which is not Israel) have a very low proportion of high-tech products. If the country in question is one where high-tech exports are indeed a small fraction of total exports, this could be accurate.

Given that the claim juxtaposes Israel's high-tech export proportion to China with another country's overall export proportion, and assuming the second country has a low high-tech export percentage, the claim could be seen as highlighting a disparity.

Azerbaijan is always invited to organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation and G20,mostly false,az,Azerbaijan is always invited to organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation and G20.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan is always invited to organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation and G20,"" we need to examine Azerbaijan's participation and invitations to these specific organizations.

1. **Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)**:
   - The SCO is a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance. Azerbaijan is not a full member of the SCO. However, Azerbaijan has participated in some SCO events and has expressed interest in closer cooperation with the organization. Azerbaijan has been involved as a dialogue partner, but this does not equate to being ""always invited"" to all SCO activities.

2. **G20**:
   - The G20 is an international forum for governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union. Azerbaijan is not a member of the G20. Occasionally, non-member countries are invited to G20 meetings, but Azerbaijan is not a regular invitee. Invitations to non-member countries are typically extended based on specific agendas or geopolitical considerations, and Azerbaijan has not been a consistent invitee.

Given this information, the claim that Azerbaijan is ""always invited"" to organizations like the SCO and G20 is not accurate. Azerbaijan has some level of engagement with the SCO but is not a regular participant in G20 meetings.

1. The initial amount of social assistance was indeed 2 billion liras.
2. The current amount of social assistance is now 38 billion liras annually.
3. The time frame over which this increase occurred.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these figures, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the figures are accurate and the increase is correctly stated, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies or context missing, it might be 'Mostly True'. If there are significant inaccuracies or misleading elements, it could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, I cannot definitively categorize it. However, if we assume the figures are accurate and the context is correct, the claim would be:

This information can vary widely depending on the country, the time period, and the specific conditions being referred to as ""sick.""

Without access to specific data, it is challenging to verify the exact number of sick prisoners. However, given the general context that prisons often have significant health issues due to overcrowding, poor sanitation, and limited access to medical care, it is plausible that there could be a substantial number of sick prisoners.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact number, the claim could be considered somewhat plausible but not definitively accurate.

1. **Identify the UN Report**: The United Nations publishes various reports, such as the Human Development Report, World Happiness Report, and others. Each report has its own criteria and indices.

2. **Check the Latest Data**: Look at the most recent version of the relevant UN report to see if Azerbaijan is listed in a high-index category.

3. **Definition of 'High-Index'**: Understand what ""high-index"" means in the context of the report. For example, in the Human Development Report, countries are classified into Very High, High, Medium, and Low Human Development categories.

Without specific details about the report and the criteria, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the Human Development Index (HDI) from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Azerbaijan has been classified in the ""High Human Development"" category in recent years.

1. **2017 Trade Volume**: The claim states that the bilateral trade volume was around 154 million dollars in 2017.
2. **2018 Trade Volume**: The claim states that the trade volume exceeded 1 billion dollars in the first 9 months of 2018.

Without access to the specific trade data from reliable sources such as government trade reports, international trade databases, or credible news sources, it is not possible to definitively verify the accuracy of these figures.

However, if we assume the data provided in the claim is accurate, the statement would be 'True'. If there is any discrepancy in the figures, the accuracy would vary accordingly.

As of the most recent data available:

- Turkey's unemployment rate has been relatively high, often fluctuating around 10-14% in recent years.
- Germany's unemployment rate has been relatively low, typically around 3-5%.
- England (part of the United Kingdom) has also had a relatively low unemployment rate, generally around 4-5%.
- Spain has had a higher unemployment rate compared to Germany and England, often around 13-15%.

Given these figures, the claim that there is ""even more unemployment in Germany, England, and Spain"" compared to Turkey is not accurate for Germany and England, but it is somewhat accurate for Spain.

Her 100 dolarlık dış borç için ülkelerin kasasında ne kadar döviz rezervi var ona bakmışlar. Türkiye’de 16 dolar. Borcuna göre kasasında en az para olan ülke Türkiye. (Gelişmekte olan piyasa ekonomileri içerisinde),true,tr,"They looked at how much foreign exchange reserves countries have in their treasuries for every 100 dollars of external debt. In Turkey, it is 16 dollars. Turkey is the country with the least amount of money in its treasury relative to its debt (among emerging market economies).","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific figures regarding Turkey's foreign exchange reserves relative to its external debt and compare them with other emerging market economies.

1. **Foreign Exchange Reserves**: These are assets held by a central bank in foreign currencies, which can include bonds, treasury bills, and other government securities.

2. **External Debt**: This is the total debt a country owes to foreign creditors.

3. **Ratio Calculation**: The claim states that Turkey has $16 in foreign exchange reserves for every $100 of external debt, which translates to a ratio of 0.16.

4. **Comparison with Other Emerging Markets**: To validate the claim that Turkey has the least amount of money in its treasury relative to its debt among emerging market economies, we need to compare this ratio with those of other countries classified as emerging markets.

Based on the latest available data from credible sources such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Turkey's foreign exchange reserves relative to its external debt have indeed been reported to be low. However, the exact ranking can fluctuate based on recent economic changes, debt repayments, and reserve accumulations.

Given the information available up to the knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Turkey has been noted for having a relatively low ratio of foreign exchange reserves to external debt among emerging markets. While it is challenging to definitively state it is the absolute lowest without the most current comparative data, the claim aligns closely with reported trends.

Neither Demirel nor Ecevit had the slightest contribution to this.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the historical context and contributions to the Marmaray project in Istanbul.

The Marmaray project is a major transportation infrastructure project in Istanbul, Turkey, which includes an undersea rail tunnel connecting the European and Asian sides of the city. The project was officially inaugurated on October 29, 2013.

1. **Initiation and Planning**: The idea of a rail tunnel under the Bosphorus dates back to the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. However, the modern Marmaray project was first proposed in the 1980s and gained momentum in the 1990s.

2. **Political Contributions**:
   - **Süleyman Demirel**: He served as Prime Minister and President of Turkey at various times. While he was in office during the early discussions of the project, there is no significant evidence that he played a direct role in the actual construction phase of the Marmaray.
   - **Bülent Ecevit**: He also served as Prime Minister of Turkey multiple times. Similar to Demirel, Ecevit was in office during the early stages of the project but did not have a direct role in the construction phase.

3. **Construction and Completion**: The actual construction of the Marmaray project began in 2004 and was completed in 2013. The project was carried out under the administration of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Given this context, the claim that neither Demirel nor Ecevit had the slightest contribution to the actual construction of the Marmaray project is accurate. The project was indeed completed under the administration of the AKP.

This would include looking at infrastructure projects, healthcare services, educational investments, and other public services.

Without access to specific and comprehensive data comparing the level of services received by each province, it is challenging to definitively verify this claim. However, if there are credible sources or government reports that rank provinces based on the services received and Hatay is indeed in the top 5, the claim could be considered accurate.

Türkiye 16 yıl aradan sonra canlı hayvan ve et ithal ediyor.,false,tr,Turkey is importing live animals and meat after a 16-year hiatus.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey is importing live animals and meat after a 16-year hiatus,"" we need to verify the historical context and current status of Turkey's import policies regarding live animals and meat.

1. **Historical Context**: Research indicates that Turkey has had periods of restricting and allowing imports of live animals and meat. These policies often change due to domestic production levels, disease outbreaks, and economic considerations.

2. **Recent Developments**: In recent years, Turkey has indeed resumed importing live animals and meat to meet domestic demand and stabilize prices. However, the exact duration of any hiatus would need to be verified through official trade records and government announcements.

3. **Verification**: If we find credible sources confirming that Turkey had a specific 16-year period without importing live animals and meat, and that this has recently changed, the claim would be accurate. If the hiatus was shorter or longer, or if there were intermittent imports during this period, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Given the complexity and the need for precise historical data, the claim as stated may not fully capture the nuances of Turkey's import policies over the past 16 years.

Nüfusun yüzde 50’si kendi seçtiği belediye başkanı tarafından yönetilmiyor.,mostly true,tr,50% of the population is not governed by the mayor they elected.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""50% of the population is not governed by the mayor they elected,"" we need to consider the context and the electoral system in place.

1. **Electoral System**: In most democratic systems, mayors are elected by a plurality or majority of the votes. This means that the mayor is chosen by the candidate who receives the most votes, even if they do not receive more than 50% of the total votes cast. In such cases, it is possible that a significant portion of the population did not vote for the winning candidate.

2. **Population Distribution**: The claim implies that half of the population did not vote for the current mayor. This could be true in a closely contested election where the winning candidate received just over 50% of the votes, or in a multi-candidate race where the winning candidate received less than 50% of the total votes.

3. **Governance**: The term ""governed by"" suggests that the mayor has authority over the entire population of the city, regardless of who they voted for. This is generally true in a mayoral system, where the elected mayor governs the entire city.

Given these considerations, the claim can be seen as a generalization that might hold true in many cases, especially in competitive elections or those with multiple candidates. However, it is not universally true for all elections and all cities.

Kadına karşı şiddeti önlemede tek başına eğitim de bir şey ifade etmiyor. Tahsil arttıkça dayağın dozu da artıyor,false,tr,"Education alone does not mean anything in preventing violence against women. As education levels increase, the severity of the violence also increases.","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the relationship between education and violence against women. Research on this topic shows mixed results, but there are some general trends and findings that can help us assess the claim.

1. **Education and Attitudes Towards Violence**: Higher levels of education are generally associated with more progressive attitudes towards gender equality and less tolerance for violence against women. Educated individuals are more likely to be aware of the legal and social unacceptability of such violence.

2. **Economic and Social Factors**: Education often correlates with better economic opportunities and social status, which can reduce stressors that might lead to violence. However, in some contexts, increased education can lead to shifts in power dynamics within relationships, potentially leading to conflict.

3. **Severity of Violence**: There is no consistent evidence to suggest that the severity of violence increases with higher education levels. In fact, many studies indicate that higher education levels are associated with lower rates of severe violence.

Given these points, the claim that ""education alone does not mean anything in preventing violence against women"" is an oversimplification. Education is a significant factor, though not the only one, in preventing violence. The assertion that ""as education levels increase, the severity of the violence also increases"" is not supported by the majority of research findings.

In this context, Turkey is one of the countries where exchange rates have risen to a reasonable level.","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Foreign Exchange Increase in Developing Countries**: It is generally true that foreign exchange rates can fluctuate significantly in developing countries due to various economic factors, including inflation, trade balances, and foreign investment.

2. **Dollar Rising**: The value of the US dollar can rise due to various factors such as US economic policies, interest rates, and global economic conditions. This can affect exchange rates globally.

3. **Turkey's Exchange Rates**: Turkey has experienced significant fluctuations in its exchange rates, particularly with the Turkish lira depreciating against the US dollar in recent years. This depreciation has been influenced by factors such as high inflation, political instability, and economic policies.

4. **Reasonable Level**: The term ""reasonable level"" is subjective and can vary depending on the context. However, given the significant depreciation of the Turkish lira, it may not be accurate to describe the current exchange rates as ""reasonable"" without further context.

Considering these points, the claim that ""Turkey is one of the countries where exchange rates have risen to a reasonable level"" is misleading. While it is true that exchange rates have risen, describing them as ""reasonable"" is debatable.

Türkiye dünyayı en az kirleten ülkeler arasında.,mostly true,tr,Turkey is among the countries that pollute the world the least.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Turkey is among the countries that pollute the world the least,"" we need to consider various metrics of pollution, such as greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, waste management, and other environmental indicators.

1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: According to data from the Global Carbon Atlas and other sources, Turkey is among the top 20 countries in terms of CO2 emissions. This suggests that Turkey is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions.

2. **Air Quality**: Turkey has faced challenges with air quality, particularly in urban areas. Reports from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) have indicated that air pollution levels in some Turkish cities exceed recommended limits.

3. **Waste Management**: Turkey has made progress in waste management, but it still faces issues with recycling rates and waste disposal practices compared to some other countries.

4. **Environmental Policies**: Turkey has been making efforts to improve its environmental policies and has ratified international agreements like the Paris Agreement. However, the implementation and effectiveness of these policies can vary.

Given these points, while Turkey has made some strides in environmental protection, it is not accurate to say it is among the countries that pollute the world the least, especially considering its significant greenhouse gas emissions and air quality issues.

1. **The Promise to Increase Employment**: Did the entity in question (likely a government or political party) make a promise to increase employment?
2. **Breaking the Unemployment Record**: Did the unemployment rate reach a record high under their tenure?

If both components are verified as true, the claim would be 'True'. If one component is true and the other is not, it would be 'Half True'. If neither component is true, it would be 'False'. If the promise was made but the unemployment record was not broken, it would be 'Mostly False'. If the unemployment record was broken but no promise was made, it would also be 'Mostly False'.

Without specific data or context, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the statement, it suggests a scenario where a promise was made but not fulfilled, leading to a worse outcome.

Üniversite mezunu her dört gençten biri işsiz.,mostly true,tr,One out of every four university graduates is unemployed.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""One out of every four university graduates is unemployed,"" we need to consider the most recent and reliable data on graduate unemployment rates. This data can vary significantly by country, economic conditions, and the time period in question.

For example, in some countries, the unemployment rate for university graduates might be lower than 25%, while in others, it could be higher. Additionally, economic downturns or booms can significantly affect these rates.

Without specific data to reference, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general trends and typical unemployment rates for university graduates in many developed countries, the claim seems to be an overestimation. Graduate unemployment rates are often reported to be lower than 25%.

1. **Source of Data**: The claim should be backed by a reliable and recent survey or study that represents the population accurately.
2. **Sample Size and Representation**: The survey should have a large and representative sample size to generalize the findings to the entire population.
3. **Survey Methodology**: The methodology used to gather the data should be sound and unbiased.

Without specific information about the source, sample size, and methodology, it is challenging to verify the claim. However, such a high percentage (98%) is unusually large and would typically require strong evidence to support it.

As of recent years, the share of e-commerce in total retail sales in China has been around 25-30%. However, the claim specifies ""total trade,"" which could include both retail and wholesale. If we consider total trade, the percentage might be lower, but 16% seems plausible.

2. **Developing Countries**: The share of e-commerce in developing countries varies widely. Some developing countries have higher e-commerce penetration, while others have much lower. A range of 6-7% could be a reasonable average, but it is difficult to generalize for all developing countries.

3. **Turkey**: According to recent data, Turkey's e-commerce share in total retail sales has been growing but is still relatively low compared to more developed markets. As of the latest reports, it is around 4-5%. The claim of 1.5% seems outdated or underestimated.

Without specific data on the current interest rate and historical rates, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent data and historical context, we can make an educated guess.

If the current interest rate is indeed the highest ever recorded by the Central Bank, the claim would be 'True'. If it is among the highest but not the absolute highest, it might be 'Mostly True'. If it is high but there have been higher rates in the past, it could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'. If the current rate is not particularly high compared to historical rates, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to how one might assess it.

1. **Number of citizens with disabilities capable of working**: The claim states that there are nearly 1.85 million citizens with disabilities in Turkey who are capable of working. This figure would need to be verified against official statistics from Turkish government sources or reputable organizations that track disability and employment data.

2. **Number of employed individuals with disabilities**: The claim also states that the number of employed individuals with disabilities does not even reach a total of 200,000. Again, this figure would need to be verified against official employment statistics.

Without access to the most recent and accurate data from reliable sources such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) or relevant government departments, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim.

1. **Global Economic Data**: According to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), the average growth rate of developing countries can vary year by year. For instance, in recent years, the average growth rate for developing countries (excluding China and India) has typically ranged between 2% to 3%.

2. **Comparison**: If the average growth rate of developing countries excluding China and India is around 2% to 3%, then a 4% growth rate would indeed be more than twice the lower end of this range (2%) and slightly more than twice the upper end (3%).

Given this context, the claim that ""With a 4% growth rate, we grew more than twice the average of developing countries excluding China and India"" is generally accurate.

The WHO has set guidelines for various pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3). For instance, the WHO guideline for PM2.5 is an annual mean of 5 µg/m³ and a 24-hour mean of 15 µg/m³.

To verify the claim, we would need specific data on the air pollution levels in Bursa. If recent measurements show that the levels of a particular pollutant (e.g., PM2.5) in Bursa are indeed 10 times higher than the WHO's recommended limits, the claim would be true. However, without specific data, we cannot definitively confirm or refute the claim.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we can only assess the plausibility based on general knowledge. Air pollution levels in some cities can indeed exceed WHO guidelines by significant margins, but claiming a specific factor like ""10 times"" requires precise data.

1. **Stagnation**: Economic stagnation refers to a prolonged period of slow economic growth. In 2014, global economic growth was moderate. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported a global growth rate of 3.4%, which was an improvement from the previous year but still below pre-crisis levels. Some regions, like the Eurozone, experienced slower growth, which could be seen as stagnation.

2. **Inflation**: Inflation rates varied by country in 2014. In the United States, inflation was relatively low, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increasing by about 1.6%. In the Eurozone, inflation was also low, leading to concerns about deflation rather than inflation. However, some emerging markets experienced higher inflation rates.

3. **Unemployment**: Unemployment rates also varied. In the United States, the unemployment rate decreased from 6.7% in December 2013 to 5.6% in December 2014, indicating an improvement. In the Eurozone, unemployment remained high, particularly in countries like Greece and Spain.

4. **Debts**: Global debt levels continued to rise in 2014. Both public and private debt increased in many countries, driven by low-interest rates and ongoing fiscal deficits.

Given this information, the claim that all these factors ""escalated"" in 2014 is not entirely accurate. While debt levels did increase, inflation was generally low, and unemployment rates improved in some major economies like the United States. Economic growth was moderate, with some regions experiencing stagnation.

   - The average debt-to-GDP ratio for European Union countries is significantly higher. For instance, in 2022, the EU average was around 88%, which is roughly three times Turkey's ratio.

2. **Budget Deficit Comparison:**
   - The claim also states that the budget deficits of European countries are three times those of Turkey.
   - Turkey's budget deficit has varied, but in recent years it has been around 3-4% of GDP.
   - The budget deficits of European countries also vary widely. Some countries have deficits higher than Turkey's, while others have lower deficits. The average budget deficit in the EU has been around 3-4% of GDP, similar to Turkey's.

Given this information:

- The first part of the claim about the debt-to-GDP ratio is accurate.
- The second part of the claim about budget deficits is not accurate, as the average budget deficit in the EU is not three times that of Turkey.

Onlar (Suriyeli sığınmacılar) gelmeden önce petrolün fiyatı ne kadardı? Varili 100 doların üzerindeydi. Şimdi ne kadar? 50 dolar civarında.,true,tr,'What was the price of oil before they (Syrian refugees) arrived? It was over $100 per barrel. How much is it now? Around $50.',"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the historical prices of oil and the timeline of the Syrian refugee crisis.

1. **Historical Oil Prices**:
   - Before the Syrian refugee crisis escalated (around 2011), oil prices were indeed over $100 per barrel. For example, in 2011, the average price of Brent crude oil was around $111 per barrel.
   - By 2014, oil prices were still relatively high, averaging around $99 per barrel.

2. **Syrian Refugee Crisis Timeline**:
   - The Syrian civil war began in 2011, leading to a significant increase in the number of refugees over the following years.
   - The refugee crisis became particularly acute around 2014-2015, with large numbers of refugees fleeing to Europe and other regions.

3. **Oil Prices Around 2015**:
   - By mid-2014, oil prices began to decline sharply due to various factors, including increased oil production in the United States (shale oil boom), OPEC's decision not to cut production, and a slowdown in global economic growth.
   - By early 2015, oil prices had dropped to around $50 per barrel and fluctuated around that level for some time.

**Analysis**:
- The claim that oil prices were over $100 per barrel before the Syrian refugees arrived is accurate for the period before 2014.
- The claim that oil prices were around $50 per barrel at the time of the statement (assuming it was made around 2015) is also accurate.
- However, the implication that the arrival of Syrian refugees caused the drop in oil prices is misleading. The decline in oil prices was primarily due to market dynamics, including supply and demand factors, rather than the refugee crisis.

**Conclusion**:
The factual components of the claim regarding oil prices are correct, but the implied causation between the arrival of Syrian refugees and the drop in oil prices is incorrect.

2009 yılından beri İsrail’le en yüksek ticaret yaşandı.,true,tr,"Since 2009, the highest trade has occurred with Israel.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Since 2009, the highest trade has occurred with Israel,"" we need to consider the context and the specific countries involved in trade. Generally, the highest trade volumes for most countries are with major global economies such as the United States, China, the European Union, and others. Israel, while a significant trading partner for some countries, is not typically the highest trading partner for most countries.

Without specific data or context about which country or region's trade is being referred to, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge of global trade patterns, it is unlikely that Israel has been the highest trade partner for most countries since 2009.

"Türkiye´nin eğitime ayırdığı pay milli gelirin yüzde 5,8´inden fazladır. Bu oranla biz Avrupa´da eğitime en fazla kaynak ayıran ülkeyiz. Türkiye´den daha fazla eğitime kaynak ayıran ülke yok.",false,tr,"The share Turkey allocates to education is more than 5.8% of the national income. With this ratio, we are the country in Europe that allocates the most resources to education. There is no country that allocates more resources to education than Turkey.","To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether Turkey allocates more than 5.8% of its national income to education.
2. Whether this allocation is the highest in Europe.

According to data from the OECD and other international organizations, the percentage of national income (GDP) that countries allocate to education can vary. As of recent data, several European countries, including Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, allocate a significant portion of their GDP to education, often around or above 6%.

For instance, Denmark has historically allocated around 6-7% of its GDP to education, which would be higher than the 5.8% claimed for Turkey. Similarly, other Nordic countries also have high education spending relative to their GDP.

Given this information, the claim that Turkey allocates more resources to education than any other country in Europe is not accurate.

1. The number of EU member countries: As of 2023, the European Union has 27 member countries, not 28. The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020.

2. The ranking of the country in question: We need to check the most recent data on the general government budget balance for EU countries to see if the country in question is indeed ranked 4th.

Given that the claim references 28 EU member countries, which is incorrect, and without specific data to verify the exact ranking, the claim cannot be fully accurate.

Bir milyon 350 bin Suriyeli var ve hiçbir kontrol ve kayıt yok,mostly true,tr,There are 1 million 350 thousand Syrians and there is no control or registration.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There are 1 million 350 thousand Syrians and there is no control or registration,"" we need to break it down into two parts: the number of Syrians and the statement about control or registration.

1. **Number of Syrians**: The number of Syrians in a given country or region can vary widely depending on the context. For example, Turkey hosts a large number of Syrian refugees, with estimates often cited around 3.6 million as of recent years. In other countries, the numbers can be significantly lower. The figure of 1 million 350 thousand could be accurate in a specific context, but it is not universally applicable.

2. **Control or Registration**: Most countries hosting significant numbers of Syrian refugees have some form of control or registration system in place. For instance, Turkey has a comprehensive registration system for Syrian refugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) also plays a significant role in registering and providing assistance to Syrian refugees in various countries.

Given these points, the claim that there is ""no control or registration"" is generally inaccurate, as most host countries and international organizations have mechanisms to manage and register refugees.

IMF’ye borç veren bir ülke olduk,mostly false,tr,We have become a country that lends to the IMF.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have become a country that lends to the IMF,"" we need to consider the context and the specifics of the country's relationship with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

1. **IMF Lending and Borrowing Dynamics**: The IMF is an international organization that provides financial assistance to member countries facing economic difficulties. Countries can either be borrowers (receiving financial assistance) or lenders (providing financial resources to the IMF).

2. **IMF Quotas and Contributions**: Member countries contribute to the IMF's financial resources through a system of quotas, which are based on their economic size and capacity. These contributions can be seen as a form of lending to the IMF, as they provide the financial pool from which the IMF can lend to other countries.

3. **Recent Trends**: In recent years, some countries that were traditionally borrowers have improved their economic situations and have become contributors to the IMF's resources. This shift can be seen as these countries transitioning from being borrowers to lenders.

4. **Specific Country Context**: Without specifying the country in question, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if the country in question has indeed moved from a position of borrowing from the IMF to contributing to its resources, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given these points, if the country in question has transitioned from borrowing to contributing to the IMF's resources, the claim can be considered ""True."" If the country is still primarily a borrower or has not significantly contributed to the IMF's resources, the claim would be ""False.""

**Assuming the country in question has indeed become a contributor to the IMF's resources:**

Real əməkhaqqının artım tempi inflyasiyanı iki-üç dəfə üstələyir,false,az,The growth rate of real wages exceeds inflation by two to three times.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The growth rate of real wages exceeds inflation by two to three times,"" we need to understand the relationship between real wages and inflation.

1. **Real Wages**: Real wages are adjusted for inflation and reflect the purchasing power of income. If real wages are increasing, it means that wages are growing faster than inflation, allowing workers to buy more goods and services.

2. **Inflation**: Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, eroding purchasing power.

For the claim to be true, the growth rate of real wages would need to be significantly higher than the rate of inflation, specifically by two to three times. This is a substantial difference and would imply a very strong increase in real wages relative to inflation.

In practice, the relationship between real wages and inflation can vary significantly based on economic conditions, labor market dynamics, and policy decisions. Historically, there have been periods where real wages have grown faster than inflation, but the magnitude of ""two to three times"" is quite large and not commonly observed over extended periods.

Given the variability and the specific magnitude mentioned in the claim, it is unlikely that real wages consistently grow at a rate two to three times higher than inflation.

"Türkiye, internet hızında Avrupa sonuncusu",true,tr,Turkey is the last in Europe in terms of internet speed.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Turkey is the last in Europe in terms of internet speed,"" we need to refer to reliable and recent data sources that rank countries based on their internet speeds. These sources could include reports from organizations like Ookla's Speedtest Global Index, Akamai's State of the Internet report, or other reputable internet speed ranking entities.

As of the latest available data, Turkey is not the last in Europe in terms of internet speed. While Turkey may not rank among the top countries in Europe for internet speed, it is not at the very bottom. Several other countries in Europe have slower average internet speeds than Turkey.

"Son 20 yılın en yüksek tek ayı geldi gıda enflasyonunda, %6,5’a yakın.",mostly false,tr,"The highest single month in the last 20 years has arrived in food inflation, close to 6.5%.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The highest single month in the last 20 years has arrived in food inflation, close to 6.5%,"" we need to verify historical data on food inflation rates over the past two decades.

1. **Historical Data Check**: We need to look at the monthly food inflation rates for the last 20 years. This data is typically available from government sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States or equivalent agencies in other countries.

2. **Comparison**: Once we have the data, we can identify the highest monthly food inflation rate within the last 20 years and see if it is close to 6.5%.

Without access to the specific data at this moment, I can provide a general approach:

- If the highest monthly food inflation rate in the last 20 years is indeed around 6.5%, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the highest rate is slightly different but still close to 6.5%, the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- If the highest rate is significantly different but there is some truth to the claim, it would be 'Half True'.
- If the highest rate is much lower or higher, making the claim misleading, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge, food inflation rates can vary significantly, and a 6.5% monthly rate would be unusually high.

The daily expenditure, which was 2.5 million lira in 2018, increased fourfold in 2019.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the information provided:

1. The daily expenditure of the Palace in 2019 was 10 million lira.
2. The annual expenditure in 2019 was 3.6 billion lira.
3. The daily expenditure in 2018 was 2.5 million lira.
4. The daily expenditure increased fourfold from 2018 to 2019.

First, let's verify the consistency of the daily and annual expenditures for 2019:
- If the daily expenditure in 2019 was 10 million lira, the annual expenditure would be:
  \( 10 \text{ million lira/day} \times 365 \text{ days/year} = 3.65 \text{ billion lira/year} \).
  This is very close to the reported 3.6 billion lira, so this part of the claim is consistent.

Next, let's check the increase from 2018 to 2019:
- The daily expenditure in 2018 was 2.5 million lira.
- If the daily expenditure increased fourfold in 2019, it would be:
  \( 2.5 \text{ million lira/day} \times 4 = 10 \text{ million lira/day} \).
  This matches the reported daily expenditure for 2019.

Given that all parts of the claim are consistent and accurate based on the provided data, the claim is 'True'.

"... (Türkiye) bir dönem dünyanın en önemli pamuk üreticilerinden birisiydik, şu anda dünyanın en önemli pamuk ithalatçılarından birisiyiz.",true,tr,"""Turkey was once one of the world's most important cotton producers, but now we are one of the world's most important cotton importers.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine historical and current data on Turkey's cotton production and importation.

1. **Historical Context**: Turkey has indeed been a significant cotton producer historically. The country has a long tradition of cotton cultivation, particularly in regions like the Aegean, Çukurova, and Southeastern Anatolia.

2. **Current Production**: In recent years, Turkey remains a major cotton producer, but its production has faced challenges. Factors such as water scarcity, high production costs, and competition from other crops have impacted domestic cotton production.

3. **Current Importation**: Turkey is also one of the largest importers of cotton. The textile and apparel industry in Turkey is substantial, and to meet the demand, the country imports a significant amount of cotton, particularly from the United States, Brazil, and other countries.

Given this context, the claim that Turkey was once one of the world's most important cotton producers is accurate. The statement that Turkey is now one of the world's most important cotton importers is also accurate. However, the claim might slightly exaggerate the shift by implying a complete transition from production to importation, whereas Turkey still produces a significant amount of cotton domestically.

1. **2003 Ranking**: We need to confirm if Turkey was indeed ranked 39th in 2003.
2. **Current Ranking**: We need to verify if Turkey is currently ranked 9th.

Without access to the specific data from these years, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on available information and typical sources for such rankings, it is unlikely that Turkey has made such a significant leap in infrastructure rankings over this period.

**Research Findings**:
- The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report is a common source for such rankings.
- Historical data from these reports would be needed to confirm the exact rankings for 2003 and the current year.

Without access to real-time data or specific regional pricing information, it is challenging to verify these exact figures. However, generally speaking, fuel prices can vary significantly based on location, subsidies, and market conditions. 

Given the significant price difference mentioned in the claim, it is plausible that there could be a discrepancy due to subsidies or tax differences between fuel for private yachts and agricultural diesel. However, without concrete data, we cannot definitively confirm the exact prices.

Çocuk gelinlerde dünya üçüncüsüyüz.,false,tr,We are third in the world for child brides.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are third in the world for child brides,"" we need to look at reliable data sources such as reports from international organizations like UNICEF, the United Nations, or other reputable institutions that track child marriage statistics globally.

According to UNICEF and other international reports, countries like India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria have some of the highest numbers of child brides. The ranking can vary depending on whether we are looking at absolute numbers or percentages of the population.

If the claim is referring to absolute numbers, India and Bangladesh are often at the top, with Nigeria also having a significant number of child brides. However, the third position can vary depending on the specific data set and year.

If the claim is referring to the percentage of child brides in the population, countries like Niger, Central African Republic, and Chad often rank highest.

Without specific data to confirm the exact ranking, it is challenging to definitively state the accuracy of the claim. However, based on general knowledge and available data, it is unlikely that the country making the claim is consistently ranked third in the world for child brides.

1. **Time Frame**: The AKP (Justice and Development Party) came to power in Turkey in 2002. Therefore, 12 years of AKP rule would place us around 2014.

2. **Poverty Statistics**: We need to verify the poverty statistics in Turkey around 2014. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) and other reliable sources, the poverty rate and the number of people living in poverty can be cross-checked.

3. **Definitions and Measurements**: The definition of poverty and the criteria used to measure it can vary. It's important to understand whether the claim refers to absolute poverty, relative poverty, or another measure.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, let's look at available statistics from credible sources around 2014:

- According to TurkStat, the poverty rate in Turkey has fluctuated over the years. In 2014, the relative poverty rate was around 22.4%, and the number of people living below the poverty line was significant but varied depending on the specific criteria used.

- Reports from international organizations like the World Bank and OECD also provide insights into poverty levels in Turkey during this period.

Based on the available data, it is plausible that the number of people living in poverty could be around 17 million, but this figure would need to be verified against specific reports from that time.

**Conclusion**: Without exact figures from a reliable source confirming the 17 million number, but considering the general trends and available data, the claim appears to be in the ballpark but may not be precise.

In previous meetings as well, as in the case of the last meeting in Australia, Davutoğlu should have continued this duty.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Role of the Prime Minister in G-20 Meetings**: The G-20 is an international forum for governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union.

2. **Historical Precedent**: The claim mentions that in previous meetings, specifically the last meeting in Australia, the Prime Minister (in this case, Ahmet Davutoğlu) represented the country. This suggests a precedent for the Prime Minister's attendance.

3. **Country-Specific Practices**: Different countries may have different practices regarding who represents them at G-20 meetings. For Turkey, it has often been the Prime Minister or the President.

Given these points, the claim that the office of the Prime Minister should administratively represent at the G-20 meetings aligns with the general practice and historical precedent mentioned. However, it is not an absolute rule and can vary based on the country's internal decisions.

Avropa Parlamentinin qarşısında Azərbaycanın xüsusi bir öhdəliyi yoxdur,false,az,Azerbaijan has no special obligation to the European Parliament.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Azerbaijan has no special obligation to the European Parliament,"" we need to consider the nature of the relationship between Azerbaijan and the European Parliament.

1. **European Parliament's Role**: The European Parliament is one of the legislative bodies of the European Union (EU). It represents the citizens of the EU member states and has legislative, supervisory, and budgetary responsibilities within the EU framework.

2. **Azerbaijan's Status**: Azerbaijan is not a member of the European Union. Therefore, it is not directly subject to the legislative authority of the European Parliament. However, Azerbaijan is a member of the Eastern Partnership, an initiative of the EU governing its relationship with the post-Soviet states of Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus.

3. **Agreements and Cooperation**: While Azerbaijan is not bound by EU laws, it does engage in various forms of cooperation with the EU, including political dialogue, economic cooperation, and agreements on issues such as energy and trade. These agreements may involve certain commitments, but they do not equate to a ""special obligation"" to the European Parliament itself.

4. **Diplomatic and Political Influence**: The European Parliament can pass resolutions and make statements regarding Azerbaijan, which can influence diplomatic relations and public opinion. However, these do not constitute binding obligations for Azerbaijan.

Given this context, the claim that ""Azerbaijan has no special obligation to the European Parliament"" is accurate in the sense that Azerbaijan is not legally bound by the European Parliament's decisions or directives, unlike EU member states.

1. **Istanbul is the 15th most populous city in the world**:
   - As of the latest data, Istanbul is one of the most populous cities globally, but its exact rank can vary depending on the source and the criteria used (city proper, metropolitan area, etc.). It is often ranked within the top 20, but not consistently at 15th.

2. **Producing a quarter of the GDP**:
   - Istanbul is a significant economic hub in Turkey, contributing a substantial portion of the country's GDP. Estimates suggest it contributes around 30% of Turkey's GDP, which aligns with the claim of ""a quarter.""

3. **Contributing 40% of the taxes**:
   - Istanbul is a major contributor to Turkey's tax revenue. While exact figures can vary, it is reasonable to state that Istanbul contributes a significant portion, often cited around 40%.

4. **If it were a country on its own, it would be one of the 25-30 largest economies in the world**:
   - Istanbul's economy is substantial. If it were a country, its GDP would place it among the top 30 economies globally, considering the GDP of countries around that rank.

Given the analysis, the claim is largely accurate but may have slight variations in specific figures or rankings. Therefore, the most appropriate classification is:

12 yılda 205 bin derslik inşa ettik.,true,tr,"In 12 years, we built 205 thousand classrooms.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In 12 years, we built 205 thousand classrooms,"" we need to verify the data regarding the number of classrooms built over a 12-year period. This would typically involve checking official records, government reports, or credible sources that track educational infrastructure development.

Without access to specific data or sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to assess such a statement:

1. **Check Official Reports**: Look for government or educational department reports that detail infrastructure projects over the past 12 years.
2. **Cross-Reference with News Articles**: News articles and press releases can provide additional context and verification.
3. **Consult Educational Statistics Databases**: Organizations like UNESCO or national statistics bureaus often have detailed records on educational infrastructure.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, I must refrain from making a definitive judgment.

1. **Historical Context**: We need to compare the current increase to previous increases in the Presidential budget to determine if it is indeed unprecedented.
2. **Verification of the 97% Increase**: We need to confirm whether the Presidential budget has actually been increased by 97%.
3. **Source and Credibility**: The claim should be verified against reliable sources such as government budget reports or credible news outlets.

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general knowledge and typical budgetary changes, a 97% increase in the Presidential budget would be highly unusual and likely to be widely reported if true.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim and the extraordinary nature of a 97% increase, it is reasonable to be skeptical.

Mikayil Jabbarov is the Minister of Economy of Azerbaijan, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments, including Azerbaijan's, announced various forms of state aid for employees affected by the crisis. If Jabbarov made a statement about state aid for employees, it would likely be documented in official government releases or credible news sources.

Without access to the specific statement and the context in which it was made, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if the statement aligns with known government policies and actions during the pandemic, it could be considered accurate.

Ahmet Davutoğlu’nu siyasete ben kazandırdım,true,tr,I brought Ahmet Davutoğlu into politics.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I brought Ahmet Davutoğlu into politics,"" we need to consider the context and the role of the person making the claim.

Ahmet Davutoğlu is a prominent Turkish politician who served as the Prime Minister of Turkey from 2014 to 2016. Before entering politics, he was an academic and a foreign policy advisor. His entry into active politics is often attributed to his close association with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the President of Turkey, who appointed him as the Chief Advisor to the Prime Minister in 2003 and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2009.

Given this background, if the claim is made by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, it would be considered accurate because Erdoğan played a significant role in bringing Davutoğlu into the political arena and appointing him to key positions.

In the last two months, the number of people who have become unemployed is 1 million 300 thousand. 400 thousand people have been looking for a job for a year but cannot find one.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the provided information:

1. **Total Unemployed People**: 6 million 200 thousand (6,200,000)
2. **Newly Unemployed in the Last Two Months**: 1 million 300 thousand (1,300,000)
3. **People Looking for a Job for a Year**: 400 thousand (400,000)

The claim states:
- There are 6.2 million unemployed people.
- In the last two months, 1.3 million people have become unemployed.
- 400 thousand people have been looking for a job for a year but cannot find one.

To verify the claim, we need to ensure that these numbers are consistent and plausible within the context provided. 

1. **Total Unemployed**: The claim of 6.2 million unemployed people is a specific figure.
2. **Newly Unemployed**: The addition of 1.3 million newly unemployed people in the last two months should be part of the total 6.2 million.
3. **Long-term Unemployed**: The 400 thousand people looking for a job for a year should also be part of the total 6.2 million.

Given that the numbers provided do not contradict each other and seem to fit logically within the context of the total unemployment figure, the claim appears to be consistent and accurate based on the information given.

Many countries have implemented e-visa systems to facilitate easier travel for tourists. For instance, countries like India, Australia, and Kenya have well-established e-visa systems.

1. **Nature of the Amendment**: What changes does the amendment introduce? Does it increase the cost of legal services, reduce the availability of pro bono work, or impose additional barriers to accessing legal aid?

2. **Impact on Low-Income Families**: How do these changes specifically affect low-income families? Are there any studies, reports, or expert opinions that highlight the difficulties faced by low-income families due to this amendment?

Without specific details about the amendment and its direct impact, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if the amendment increases costs or reduces access to legal services, it is reasonable to infer that low-income families would face difficulties.

Without specific data or evidence to confirm or refute these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is being made in good faith and there is no evidence to the contrary, we might lean towards a certain level of truthfulness.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to fully verify or disprove the claim, the most cautious and balanced approach would be to consider it as 'Half True'. This acknowledges that the claim could be partially accurate but also leaves room for the possibility that it might not be entirely correct.

1. Industrial production in October increased by 4.6% compared to the same month of the previous year.
2. This increase has brought industrial production to its highest level since 2005.

Without access to the specific data on industrial production for October and historical records, I cannot definitively verify these points. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and both points are correct, the claim would be 'True'.

If only one of the points is correct, the claim would be 'Half True'. If neither point is correct, the claim would be 'False'. If the increase is close to 4.6% but not exactly, or if the level is near but not the highest since 2005, the claim would be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the specifics.

1. **Role of PACE Rapporteur**: The PACE rapporteur is responsible for reporting on specific issues and making recommendations. Their role is generally to observe, report, and suggest improvements rather than to issue threats.

2. **Evidence of Threats**: If there is documented evidence of the PACE rapporteur making statements or taking actions that can be reasonably interpreted as threats towards Azerbaijan, this would support the claim. Conversely, if the rapporteur's actions are consistent with their mandate of observation and reporting without any threatening language or behavior, the claim would be false.

3. **Official Statements and Reports**: Reviewing official statements, reports, and actions taken by the PACE rapporteur regarding Azerbaijan would provide clarity. If these documents show a pattern of threats, the claim could be considered true or mostly true. If they show criticism or recommendations without threats, the claim would be false or mostly false.

Without specific evidence or context indicating that the PACE rapporteur has indeed issued threats towards Azerbaijan, the claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the rapporteur's role and actions.

The number of voters has almost doubled, but we only increased it by 50.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the key points mentioned:

1. **Population and Voters at the Time of the Initial Increase:**
   - Population: 59 million
   - Voters: 29 million

2. **Current Population and Voters:**
   - Population: 80 million
   - Voters: 59 million (including those abroad)

3. **Increase in Number of Deputies:**
   - Initial increase: 100 deputies
   - Recent increase: 50 deputies

### Verification:

1. **Population and Voters at the Time of the Initial Increase:**
   - The population of Turkey around the late 1990s was approximately 59 million.
   - The number of voters being 29 million seems plausible given the population size and typical voter registration rates.

2. **Current Population and Voters:**
   - The current population of Turkey is around 80 million.
   - The number of voters being 59 million, including those abroad, is consistent with recent data.

3. **Increase in Number of Deputies:**
   - The number of deputies in the Turkish Grand National Assembly was increased by 100 in the past.
   - Recently, the number of deputies was increased by 50.

### Analysis:

- The claim that the number of voters has almost doubled from 29 million to 59 million is accurate.
- The claim that the population increased from 59 million to 80 million is also accurate.
- The claim that the number of deputies was increased by 100 initially and then by 50 recently is accurate.

1. **Historical Trust Levels**: Various reports and surveys from the past have indicated that trust in the judiciary in Turkey was relatively high, often cited in the range of 60-70%. For instance, surveys conducted by organizations like the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation (TESEV) in the early 2000s showed higher levels of trust in the judiciary.

2. **Current Trust Levels**: More recent surveys and reports indicate a significant decline in trust in the judiciary. For example, a 2021 survey by the Turkish polling company KONDA found that trust in the judiciary had fallen to around 20%. Other sources, such as reports from international organizations like Freedom House and Transparency International, also highlight a decline in public trust due to perceived political interference and lack of judicial independence.

Given this information, the claim appears to be supported by both historical and recent data.

Explanation: The relationship between population increase and socio-economic development is complex and context-dependent. In some cases, population growth can drive economic development by providing a larger workforce and creating greater demand for goods and services.

1. **UNICEF Reports**: UNICEF regularly publishes reports on the well-being of children globally, including happiness and life satisfaction. These reports often include comparative data across different countries.

2. **OECD PISA Reports**: The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) by the OECD also includes measures of student well-being and life satisfaction, which can provide insights into the happiness of 15-year-old children in various countries.

3. **Other Studies and Surveys**: Various other organizations and academic studies may also provide data on the happiness and well-being of children in different countries.

To verify the claim, we would need to check the most recent and relevant data from these sources. If recent reports or studies indicate that 15-year-old children in Turkey have the lowest levels of happiness compared to their peers in other countries, the claim could be considered accurate. However, if the data does not support this, the claim would be false.

Without specific data from these sources at hand, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general knowledge and the absence of widely publicized reports specifically stating that Turkish 15-year-olds are the unhappiest in the world, it is likely that the claim is an exaggeration or misinterpretation of available data.

2. **Japan**: Verify if Japan's stock market lost 20%.
3. **America**: Verify if the American stock market (e.g., S&P 500) lost 21%.
4. **UK**: Verify if the UK stock market (e.g., FTSE 100) lost 22%.
5. **Germany**: Verify if Germany's stock market (e.g., DAX) lost 26%.
6. **Italy**: Verify if Italy's stock market (e.g., FTSE MIB) lost 32%.
7. **Our loss**: Verify if the entity making the claim lost 17%.

Without access to historical stock market data for the specified period, I cannot definitively verify each percentage. However, assuming the data provided is accurate and the losses for each country are correctly stated, the claim would be evaluated as follows:

- The claim states that the Indian Stock Exchange lost 18%, while the entity making the claim lost 17%.
- The losses for Japan, America, the UK, Germany, and Italy are also specified.

If all the provided percentages are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies, it could be 'Mostly True'. If there are significant inaccuracies, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Restrictions on travel of Russian citizens of Armenian origin to Azerbaijan is a violation of conditions of agreement,mostly false,az,Restrictions on travel of Russian citizens of Armenian origin to Azerbaijan is a violation of conditions of agreement.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Restrictions on travel of Russian citizens of Armenian origin to Azerbaijan is a violation of conditions of agreement,"" we need to consider the specific agreements and treaties in place between the countries involved.

1. **Bilateral Agreements**: Russia and Azerbaijan have various bilateral agreements that facilitate travel and cooperation. However, these agreements often include clauses that allow for exceptions based on national security or other concerns.

2. **International Law**: Under international law, countries generally have the right to control entry into their territory and can impose restrictions for security reasons. This includes the right to deny entry to individuals based on their ethnicity if it is deemed a security risk, although such actions can be controversial and may be seen as discriminatory.

3. **Specific Agreements**: If there is a specific agreement between Russia and Azerbaijan that explicitly states that citizens of one country should not face discrimination based on ethnicity, then imposing such restrictions could be seen as a violation. However, without specific details of such an agreement, it is difficult to definitively state that the restrictions are a violation.

Given the general principles of international law and the typical content of bilateral agreements, the claim that such restrictions are a violation of the conditions of an agreement is not fully substantiated without more specific information.

1. **Paris Principles**: These are a set of international standards which frame and guide the work of national human rights institutions (NHRIs). They emphasize independence, a broad mandate based on universal human rights standards, adequate resources, and a pluralistic representation.

2. **Independent Operation**: This involves both legal frameworks that ensure independence and practical, real-world application of these frameworks.

If the Ombudsman’s work is indeed based on the Paris Principles and its independent operation is fully ensured in both legislation and practice, the claim would be 'True'. However, if there are any significant deviations or issues in either the adherence to the Paris Principles or the practical independence, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Given the information provided, without specific evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is accurate but not without potential for minor deviations or challenges in practice.

1. **Research and Verification**: 
   - Check the WHO's official statements, press releases, and reports.
   - Look for any specific mentions of Azerbaijan being highlighted as a model country in the context of COVID-19 management.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - Understand the criteria and context in which the WHO might label a country as a ""model"" in fighting coronavirus.
   - Compare Azerbaijan's COVID-19 response metrics (e.g., infection rates, vaccination rates, healthcare system response) with global standards and WHO recommendations.

3. **Cross-Referencing**:
   - Look for independent news reports or expert analyses that might corroborate or refute the claim.

Based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there is no widely recognized or documented instance where the WHO has officially labeled Azerbaijan as a ""model country"" in the fight against coronavirus. While Azerbaijan may have implemented effective measures, the specific claim that the WHO has called it a model country does not appear to be substantiated by official WHO sources.

Heydər Əliyevin hakimiyyəti dövründə təqsirsizlik prezumpsiyası təmin edildi,half true,az,"During Heydar Aliyev's rule, the presumption of innocence was ensured.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""During Heydar Aliyev's rule, the presumption of innocence was ensured,"" we need to consider the historical and political context of his leadership in Azerbaijan.

Heydar Aliyev served as the President of Azerbaijan from 1993 to 2003. His tenure was marked by significant political and economic changes, but also by allegations of authoritarianism, human rights abuses, and suppression of political opposition. The presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle of fair legal proceedings, meaning that an individual is considered innocent until proven guilty.

Several reports from international human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have documented concerns about the rule of law and judicial independence in Azerbaijan during Aliyev's presidency. These reports often highlighted issues such as politically motivated arrests, lack of fair trials, and pressure on the judiciary, which would undermine the presumption of innocence.

Given this context, it is unlikely that the presumption of innocence was consistently ensured during Heydar Aliyev's rule. While there may have been instances where legal proceedings adhered to this principle, the overall environment suggests significant deviations from it.

1. **Historical Context**: Terrorism, particularly related to the Kurdish insurgency and other groups, has been a persistent issue in Turkey for decades. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has been active since the 1980s, and while there have been periods of reduced activity, it is not accurate to say terrorism was completely eradicated in 2002.

2. **AKP's Rise to Power**: The Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in Turkey in 2002. Since then, there have been various periods of increased and decreased terrorist activity, including attacks by the PKK, ISIS, and other groups.

3. **Complexity of Terrorism**: The resurgence or decline of terrorism can be influenced by numerous factors, including political, social, and international dynamics. It is overly simplistic to attribute the revival of terrorism solely to the AKP's governance.

Given these points, the claim that terrorism was eradicated in 2002 and then revived with the AKP is an oversimplification and does not accurately reflect the complexities of the situation.

1. The claim states that the number of people seeking medical attention for psychological disorders has increased fourfold in the last 4 years.
2. It also states that the number has risen from 3 million to 9 million.

First, let's analyze the numerical increase:
- An increase from 3 million to 9 million is a threefold increase, not a fourfold increase. A fourfold increase would mean the number should have risen to 12 million (3 million * 4 = 12 million).

Given this discrepancy, the claim that the number has increased fourfold is incorrect based on the provided figures. However, the number has indeed increased significantly, from 3 million to 9 million, which is a threefold increase.

1. **Population Growth in Ankara**: Verify if the population in Ankara has been increasing over the last 8 years.

3. **Public Transportation Trends**: Assess if there is a trend showing a decrease in the number of passengers using public transportation in Ankara despite the population increase.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, it would suggest a significant drop in metro usage and a decrease in public transportation usage overall, despite population growth.

On dört yıllık AKP iktidarı döneminde 2 milyon esnaf ve sanatkar dükkanını kapattı.,false,tr,"During the fourteen-year rule of the AKP, 2 million tradesmen and artisans closed their shops.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""During the fourteen-year rule of the AKP, 2 million tradesmen and artisans closed their shops,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of the Claim**: The claim should ideally be backed by reliable data from credible sources such as government reports, independent studies, or reputable news organizations.

2. **Context**: The economic and political context during the AKP's rule, including any significant events that might have impacted tradesmen and artisans, such as economic crises, policy changes, or external factors.

3. **Verification**: Cross-referencing the claim with available statistics and reports from the relevant period.

Without access to specific data or sources, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge and the need for evidence to support such a specific and significant number, the claim appears to be questionable without further substantiation.

Azerbaijan is the country with the highest per capita population of IDPs and refugees in the world,mostly false,az,Azerbaijan is the country with the highest per capita population of IDPs and refugees in the world.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan is the country with the highest per capita population of IDPs and refugees in the world,"" we need to examine the available data on internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees globally.

Azerbaijan has a significant number of IDPs due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which has displaced many people within the country. However, other countries also have large populations of IDPs and refugees, such as Syria, Colombia, and South Sudan, which have experienced extensive internal displacement due to conflict and violence.

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), countries like Syria and Colombia have some of the highest numbers of IDPs. When considering per capita figures, smaller countries with significant displacement issues might have higher per capita rates.

Given this context, while Azerbaijan has a high per capita population of IDPs, it is not definitively the highest in the world. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

The transaction volume of both domestic and foreign investors also fell well below Turkey's potential.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The number of foreign transactions in mergers and acquisitions last year was at its lowest level in the past 8 years.
2. The transaction volume of both domestic and foreign investors fell well below Turkey's potential.

Without specific data from reliable sources such as financial reports, market analysis, or official statistics from the relevant year, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the number of foreign transactions was indeed at its lowest level in the past 8 years, this part of the claim would be true.
- If the transaction volume of both domestic and foreign investors fell well below Turkey's potential, this part of the claim would also be true.

Given that both parts of the claim need to be verified for a final judgment, and assuming the data is accurate, the claim would be considered 'True'. However, without concrete data, we can only make an educated guess.

1. **China**: The savings rate in China has historically been high. According to data from sources like the World Bank and OECD, China's gross savings rate has been around 45-50% in recent years. A 52% savings rate is slightly higher but within a plausible range.

2. **India**: India's savings rate has been around 30-35% in recent years, according to data from the World Bank and other financial institutions. A 35% savings rate is consistent with these figures.

3. **EU**: Savings rates in the EU vary significantly by country. For example, Germany has a relatively high savings rate, while countries like Greece and Spain have lower rates. The claim of 22%, 23%, or 24% is a reasonable approximation for the EU average, though it may not capture the full range of variation.

4. **Turkey**: Turkey's savings rate has been lower compared to the other countries mentioned. According to recent data, Turkey's savings rate has been around 13-15%, making the 13.4% figure accurate.

Given this information, the claim appears to be mostly accurate but slightly exaggerated in the case of China. Therefore, the claim is:

OPEC+ is an alliance of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil-producing nations, including Russia, that have agreed to coordinate their oil production policies to stabilize the global oil market.

OPEC+ has indeed made several agreements to reduce oil production, especially in response to market conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted global oil demand. These agreements are aimed at balancing supply and demand to support oil prices.

Given this context, if a country is a member of OPEC+ and has adhered to the production cuts agreed upon by the group, the claim that they have reduced oil production due to these commitments is accurate.

Parası değer kaybeden gelişmekte olan ülkelerin tamamı petrol üretenler.,half true,tr,All developing countries whose currency has depreciated are oil producers.,"To evaluate the claim ""All developing countries whose currency has depreciated are oil producers,"" we need to consider the following points:

1. **Currency Depreciation in Developing Countries**: Currency depreciation can occur due to various factors such as economic instability, inflation, political instability, trade imbalances, and external debt. It is not exclusive to oil-producing countries.

2. **Oil Production in Developing Countries**: While some developing countries are indeed oil producers (e.g., Nigeria, Venezuela), many others are not (e.g., Bangladesh, Nepal).

3. **Examples of Non-Oil Producing Developing Countries with Depreciated Currencies**: There are several developing countries whose currencies have depreciated but are not oil producers. For instance, Argentina and Turkey have experienced significant currency depreciation in recent years, but they are not major oil producers.

Given these points, the claim that ""All developing countries whose currency has depreciated are oil producers"" is overly broad and inaccurate. There are numerous examples of developing countries with depreciated currencies that do not produce oil.

Tarım sektöründe çalışan kadınların ise %90’ı kayıtsız çalışmaktadır.,mostly true,tr,"In Turkey, only 45% of the 8 million employed women are registered workers. In the agricultural sector, 90% of the women are unregistered workers.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the statistics provided about the employment status of women in Turkey, particularly focusing on the registration status of employed women and those in the agricultural sector.

1. **General Employment Registration**: The claim states that only 45% of the 8 million employed women in Turkey are registered workers. This implies that 55% of employed women are unregistered.

2. **Agricultural Sector**: The claim further states that in the agricultural sector, 90% of the women are unregistered workers.

To verify these statistics, we would typically refer to data from reliable sources such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), reports from international organizations like the International Labour Organization (ILO), or other credible research studies on employment in Turkey.

Based on available data and reports, it is known that a significant portion of women in Turkey, especially in the agricultural sector, work informally and are not registered. The percentage of unregistered workers in agriculture is indeed very high, often cited around 90%. Additionally, the overall registration rate for employed women in Turkey is relatively low, with many working in informal sectors.

Given this context, the claim aligns well with known data trends, though exact figures might vary slightly depending on the source and year of the data.

From last year to this year, it has risen from 3 million 103 thousand to 5.6.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the information provided:

1. The claim states that credit card debt has increased from ""3 million 103 thousand"" to ""5.6"" in a year.
2. The initial value is clearly stated as 3,103,000.
3. The final value is ambiguously stated as ""5.6."" This could imply 5.6 million, but it is not explicitly stated.

If we interpret ""5.6"" as 5.6 million, the increase would be from 3,103,000 to 5,600,000. This would be a significant increase and could be considered a true statement if the context is correct.

However, the claim lacks clarity and precision in the final value, making it difficult to definitively verify without additional context or clarification.

Türkiye'de asgari ücret 280 dolara indi. 280 dolarlık asgari ücret Avrupa'nın neresinde var?,mostly true,tr,The minimum wage in Turkey has dropped to 280 dollars. Where in Europe is there a minimum wage of 280 dollars?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the minimum wage in Turkey has dropped to 280 dollars and to compare it with minimum wages in Europe, we need to consider the most recent data available on minimum wages in both Turkey and European countries.

1. **Turkey's Minimum Wage**: As of the latest updates, Turkey's minimum wage is set in Turkish Lira (TRY). The exchange rate fluctuates, but as of recent data, the minimum wage in Turkey is approximately 8,506.80 TRY per month. Converting this to USD at an exchange rate of around 1 USD = 27 TRY (as of late 2023), the minimum wage in Turkey would be approximately 315 USD. This is higher than 280 USD.

2. **European Minimum Wages**: In Europe, minimum wages vary significantly by country. As of the latest data:
   - Countries like Luxembourg, Ireland, and the Netherlands have minimum wages well above 1,000 USD per month.
   - Eastern European countries like Bulgaria and Romania have lower minimum wages, but even these are generally above 300 USD per month.

Given this information, the claim that the minimum wage in Turkey has dropped to 280 dollars is not accurate based on the current exchange rates and the latest minimum wage figures. Additionally, there are no European countries with a minimum wage as low as 280 USD per month.

1. **Source of the Data**: Identify the source of the data that supports this claim. Is it from a reliable and authoritative source such as a government report, an independent audit, or a reputable news organization?

2. **Time Frame**: Understand the time frame over which this increase is said to have occurred. Is it over a year, several years, or another specific period?

3. **Context and Comparison**: Compare the non-tender procurement figures from the relevant periods to see if there is indeed a 71% increase. This involves looking at the actual numbers and calculations.

4. **Definitions and Scope**: Ensure that the term ""non-tender procurement"" is clearly defined and consistently used. Non-tender procurement can include various types of purchases, and the scope should be clear.

Without access to the specific data and context, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable source and the data has been accurately reported, we can make an informed judgment.

1. **Historical Data**: According to data from the World Bank and other environmental monitoring organizations, Azerbaijan's CO2 emissions have shown fluctuations over the years. There have been periods of increase and decrease, influenced by various factors such as economic activities, energy production methods, and policy changes.

2. **Recent Trends**: In recent years, Azerbaijan has made efforts to reduce its carbon footprint by investing in renewable energy sources and implementing policies aimed at reducing emissions. However, these efforts do not necessarily mean a constant decrease year over year.

3. **Verification**: To verify the claim, we would need to look at the most recent and comprehensive data available. If the data shows a consistent year-over-year decrease in CO2 emissions, the claim could be considered true. If the data shows fluctuations with some years of increase, the claim would be less accurate.

Based on the available information, it is unlikely that the amount of carbon dioxide emissions in Azerbaijan is ""constantly"" decreasing without any fluctuations.

1. **Research on Azerbaijan's Request for Aid**: 
   - Azerbaijan has been involved in international cooperation and has received support from various international organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, specific details about whether Azerbaijan formally requested aid from a particular list of 150 countries need to be verified.

2. **Verification of the List of 150 Countries**:
   - There is no widely recognized or official list of exactly 150 countries that have requested aid due to the coronavirus. The number of countries seeking aid has varied, and different sources may have different counts.

Given the lack of a specific, verifiable list of 150 countries and the fact that Azerbaijan has been involved in international aid efforts, the claim cannot be definitively proven or disproven based on the available information.

Without specific data from a reliable source such as government labor statistics or reputable economic reports, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, we can analyze the structure of the claim:

- The specific number mentioned is 1,662,000.
- The assertion that these are ""record numbers"" implies that this is the highest number of job losses recorded in a given period.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute these points, we cannot definitively categorize the claim as 'True' or 'False'. However, if we assume the numbers are accurate but lack context or comparison to historical data, the claim could be considered 'Half True'.

The claim states that the number of local newspapers was 1,950 five years ago and dropped to 1,050 in 2018.

1. **Number of Local Newspapers Five Years Ago**: The claim does not specify the exact year for ""five years ago,"" but if we assume the statement is made in 2018, then five years ago would be 2013. We need to verify if there were indeed 1,950 local newspapers in 2013.

2. **Number of Local Newspapers in 2018**: The claim states that the number dropped to 1,050 in 2018. We need to verify if this number is accurate for 2018.

Based on available data and reports, the number of local newspapers in the United States has been declining over the years. According to a report by the University of North Carolina's Hussman School of Journalism and Media, the number of local newspapers has indeed decreased significantly over the past decade.

However, specific numbers can vary depending on the source. The claim that the number dropped from 1,950 to 1,050 is a significant decline, and while the trend is accurate, the exact numbers may not be perfectly precise without specific verification from a reliable source.

Currently, three-quarters of the dormitories did not exist.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Before Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, three-quarters of today's universities did not exist. Currently, three-quarters of the dormitories did not exist,"" we need to examine the historical data on the establishment of universities and dormitories in Turkey.

1. **Universities**: 
   - Recep Tayyip Erdoğan became Prime Minister of Turkey in 2003 and later President in 2014.
   - According to available data, the number of universities in Turkey has significantly increased during Erdoğan's tenure. In 2002, there were around 76 universities in Turkey. As of recent years, this number has grown to over 200.
   - This suggests that a substantial number of universities were indeed established during Erdoğan's time in office, potentially supporting the claim that three-quarters of today's universities did not exist before him.

2. **Dormitories**:
   - The expansion of dormitory facilities has also been a focus of Erdoğan's administration, with significant investments in student housing.
   - However, specific data on the exact number of dormitories before and after Erdoğan's tenure is less readily available. The claim that three-quarters of current dormitories did not exist before Erdoğan would require detailed historical data on dormitory construction and capacity.

Given the substantial increase in the number of universities during Erdoğan's tenure, the claim about universities appears to be largely accurate. The claim about dormitories, while plausible given the government's focus on expanding student housing, lacks specific data for full verification.

1. **1915 Çanakkale Bridge**: Turkey has indeed been constructing a significant bridge project known as the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge. This bridge spans the Dardanelles Strait, which connects the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara.

2. **Length and Record**: The 1915 Çanakkale Bridge is set to be the world's longest suspension bridge by the length of its main span, which is 2,023 meters (6,637 feet). However, it is not the longest bridge overall in terms of total length.

3. **Location**: The bridge is over the Dardanelles Strait, not directly over the Sea of Marmara. The Dardanelles is a narrow strait in northwestern Turkey connecting the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara.

Given this information, the claim contains some inaccuracies regarding the specific body of water and the nature of the record being set. The bridge is indeed a significant project and will set a record, but it is not directly over the Sea of Marmara.

1. **Unemployment Rate in 2001**: The claim states that the unemployment rate was 8.4% during the peak of the crisis in 2001. This figure needs to be cross-checked with historical unemployment data for the country in question.

2. **Unemployment Rate in 2016**: The claim states that the unemployment rate had risen to 18% by 2016. This figure also needs to be verified against official statistics for that year.

3. **Unemployment Rate Among University Graduates in 2016**: The claim states that the unemployment rate among university graduates was 27.3% in 2016. This specific demographic data should be checked for accuracy.

Without access to the specific data sources or the country in question, it is challenging to definitively verify these figures. However, based on general knowledge and typical trends, the figures seem plausible but require confirmation.

In neighbouring countries average pension is approximately 70 AZN,mostly false,az,"We share first and second places in the post-Soviet space. In neighboring countries, the average pension is approximately 70 AZN.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""We share first and second places in the post-Soviet space.""
2. ""In neighboring countries, the average pension is approximately 70 AZN.""

### Part 1: ""We share first and second places in the post-Soviet space.""
This part of the claim is vague because it does not specify what metric or category is being referred to. It could be about economic growth, pension amounts, or any other measure. Without specific context, it's difficult to verify this statement.

### Part 2: ""In neighboring countries, the average pension is approximately 70 AZN.""
To verify this, we need to look at the average pension amounts in the neighboring countries of Azerbaijan, which are Armenia, Georgia, Iran, Russia, and Turkey. 

- **Armenia:** The average pension is around 44,000 AMD, which is approximately 90 AZN.
- **Georgia:** The average pension is around 240 GEL, which is approximately 150 AZN.
- **Iran:** The average pension varies, but it is generally higher than 70 AZN.
- **Russia:** The average pension is significantly higher than 70 AZN.
- **Turkey:** The average pension is also significantly higher than 70 AZN.

Based on this data, the claim that the average pension in neighboring countries is approximately 70 AZN is not accurate.

1. **Law on State Secrets**: Many countries have laws that classify certain information as state secrets, which can include military operations, locations, and other sensitive information. Disseminating such information without authorization can indeed be a violation of these laws.

2. **Footage in Military Units**: Footage taken within military units can potentially reveal sensitive information, such as troop movements, equipment, and strategies. If such footage is shared on social networks, it could be considered a breach of security protocols and state secrets.

3. **Context and Jurisdiction**: The specifics can vary by country. In some jurisdictions, any unauthorized dissemination of information from military units is strictly prohibited and considered a violation of state secrets laws.

Given these points, the claim that disseminating footage taken by citizens in military units on social networks is a violation of the ""Law on State Secrets"" is generally accurate, as such actions typically fall under unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.

There are questions that have not been answered for 20 months, three years.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The internal regulations stipulate that parliamentary questions must be answered within 15 days.
2. There are instances where questions have not been answered for 20 months or even three years.

If both points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If only one point is accurate, the claim would be 'Half True'. If neither point is accurate, the claim would be 'False'. If the points are somewhat accurate but not entirely, the claim could be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False'.

Without specific information or evidence to verify these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume the internal regulations indeed require a 15-day response time and there are documented cases of significant delays, the claim would likely be 'True'.

İşsizlik geldi yüzde 12’ye dayandı. Hiçbir kriz döneminde bu kadar yüksek işsizlik olmamıştı.,mostly false,tr,Unemployment has reached 12%. There has never been such high unemployment during any crisis period.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Unemployment has reached 12%. There has never been such high unemployment during any crisis period,"" we need to consider historical unemployment data during various crisis periods.

For example, during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the unemployment rate in the United States reached approximately 25%. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the unemployment rate in the United States peaked at around 14.8% in April 2020.

Given these historical precedents, the claim that there has never been such high unemployment during any crisis period is incorrect.

Türkiye’de özelleştirmelerin başladığı 1986'dan 2015'e dek 65 milyar dolarlık satış yapılmış. Bunun yüzde 87’sini oluşturan 57 milyar doları AKP döneminde yapılmıştır.,true,tr,"From 1986, when privatizations began in Turkey, until 2015, sales amounting to 65 billion dollars were made. Of this, 57 billion dollars, which constitutes 87%, were made during the AKP period.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The total amount of privatization sales in Turkey from 1986 to 2015.
2. The amount of privatization sales during the AKP period.
3. The percentage of total sales that occurred during the AKP period.

According to available data, the total amount of privatization sales in Turkey from 1986 to 2015 is approximately 65 billion dollars. The AKP (Justice and Development Party) came to power in 2002. From 2002 to 2015, the privatization sales amounted to approximately 57 billion dollars.

To calculate the percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{57 \text{ billion dollars}}{65 \text{ billion dollars}} \right) \times 100 \approx 87.69\% \]

This percentage is close to the 87% mentioned in the claim.

Given that the numbers and the percentage align closely with the claim, the statement is accurate.

If this event is indeed unprecedented in the history of the National Assembly, then the claim would be 'True'. However, if there have been previous instances where an opposition representative was elected as the deputy speaker, the claim would be 'False'. 

Without specific historical data or context about the National Assembly in question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the information provided and assuming no prior instances, the claim could be considered 'True'.

Komşularla ekonomimizi yüzde 8'den yüzde 32'ye çıkardık,mostly false,tr,We increased our economy with the neighbors from 8% to 32%.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We increased our economy with the neighbors from 8% to 32%,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Source**: The claim lacks context. It is unclear what specific economic metric is being referred to (e.g., trade volume, GDP growth, investment, etc.). Additionally, the source of the data is not provided, which makes it difficult to verify the accuracy.

2. **Time Frame**: The claim does not specify the time frame over which this increase occurred. Economic changes can vary significantly depending on whether the period in question is short-term or long-term.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Without comparative data or benchmarks, it is challenging to assess whether the increase from 8% to 32% is accurate or significant.

Given the lack of specific details and verifiable data, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim as 'True' or 'False'. However, the claim does suggest a significant increase, which could be plausible under certain conditions.

Vatan Partisi'nin oyları bütün Güneydoğu illerinde beş kat ile on kat arasında büyüdü.,half true,tr,The votes of the Vatan Party increased by five to ten times in all Southeastern provinces.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The votes of the Vatan Party increased by five to ten times in all Southeastern provinces,"" we would need to analyze the election data from the relevant time periods for all Southeastern provinces in Turkey. This would involve comparing the number of votes the Vatan Party received in a previous election to the number of votes received in a more recent election.

Without access to specific election data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on actual election results, we can consider the following:

1. **Scope of Increase**: The claim specifies an increase of ""five to ten times,"" which is a significant range. This would mean that if the Vatan Party received 1,000 votes in a previous election, they would need to receive between 5,000 and 10,000 votes in the subsequent election to meet this criterion.

2. **All Southeastern Provinces**: The claim states that this increase occurred in ""all Southeastern provinces."" This is a broad statement and would require consistent data across multiple provinces.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, we can only assess its plausibility based on general knowledge and trends. If the Vatan Party had a significant surge in popularity or a major event that led to increased support, such an increase might be possible. However, without concrete data, we cannot confirm the exact magnitude of the increase.

20% of Azerbaijan’s territories are under occupation,mostly false,az,20% of Azerbaijan’s territories are under occupation.,"The claim that ""20% of Azerbaijan’s territories are under occupation"" refers to the situation involving the Nagorno-Karabakh region and surrounding areas. Historically, this region has been a point of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Following the First Nagorno-Karabakh War in the early 1990s, Armenian forces occupied approximately 20% of Azerbaijan's internationally recognized territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts.

However, the situation changed significantly after the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. Azerbaijan regained control over a substantial portion of the territories that were previously occupied. As a result, the percentage of Azerbaijani territory under occupation has decreased.

Given the historical context and the recent changes in territorial control, the claim that ""20% of Azerbaijan’s territories are under occupation"" is outdated and no longer accurate.

"Türkiye Cumhuriyeti ordusu NATO’nun en büyük ordusu, yanılmıyorsam dünyanın da en büyük 3’üncü ordusudur.",false,tr,"The Turkish Republic's army is NATO's largest army and, if I'm not mistaken, the world's third largest army.","To evaluate the claim, we need to look at two parts: the size of the Turkish Republic's army within NATO and its size globally.

1. **NATO's Largest Army**: The Turkish Armed Forces are indeed one of the largest in NATO, but they are not the largest. The United States has the largest military within NATO by a significant margin. Turkey typically ranks second in terms of active military personnel within NATO.

2. **World's Third Largest Army**: Globally, the largest armies by active personnel are typically China, India, and the United States. Turkey does not rank third; it is usually within the top 10 but not in the top 3.

Given these points, the claim that the Turkish Republic's army is NATO's largest and the world's third largest is incorrect.

27. dönem yasama meclisinde kadın milletvekillerinin oranı %25 artmıştır.,false,tr,The proportion of female members of parliament in the 27th legislative term has increased by 25%.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""the proportion of female members of parliament in the 27th legislative term has increased by 25%,"" we need to compare the proportion of female members in the 27th legislative term to the previous term.

1. **Identify the proportion of female members in the previous term (26th legislative term):** Let's assume the proportion of female members in the 26th legislative term was X%.

2. **Identify the proportion of female members in the 27th legislative term:** Let's assume the proportion of female members in the 27th legislative term is Y%.

3. **Calculate the percentage increase:** The percentage increase in the proportion of female members can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{Y - X}{X} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Compare the calculated percentage increase to 25%:** If the calculated percentage increase is 25%, then the claim is true. If it is significantly different, the claim would be false or partially true.

Without the specific values of X and Y, we cannot definitively calculate the percentage increase. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data and the increase is indeed 25%, then:

If ""Fact Check"" has a history or documented instances of verifying statements made by the President regarding Azerbaijan’s army, then the claim would be considered 'True'. If they occasionally check such statements but not consistently, it might be 'Mostly True'. If they rarely or only sometimes check such statements, it could be 'Half True'. If there is little to no evidence of ""Fact Check"" verifying these specific statements, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific evidence or examples, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general practice of fact-checking organizations to verify statements made by public officials, it is plausible that they would check statements about significant topics such as a country's military.

“ASAN Xidmət” dünya üçün nümunədir,half true,az,"""ASAN Service is a model for the world.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""ASAN Service is a model for the world,"" we need to evaluate the context and evidence supporting this statement.

ASAN Service, which stands for ""Azerbaijan Service and Assessment Network,"" is a public service organization in Azerbaijan designed to simplify and improve the delivery of government services to citizens. It has received international recognition and several awards for its innovative approach to public service delivery, including the United Nations Public Service Award.

Factors supporting the claim:
1. **International Recognition**: ASAN Service has been acknowledged by international bodies, which suggests it has elements that could be considered exemplary.
2. **Awards and Accolades**: Winning prestigious awards like the UN Public Service Award indicates that the service has been evaluated positively on a global scale.
3. **Efficiency and Transparency**: The model emphasizes efficiency, transparency, and reducing corruption, which are universally desirable traits in public service.

Factors against the claim:
1. **Context-Specific Success**: While ASAN Service has been successful in Azerbaijan, the model's applicability and success in other countries with different administrative, cultural, and political contexts are not guaranteed.
2. **Scalability and Adaptability**: The model may need significant adjustments to be implemented effectively in other countries, which could limit its status as a universal model.

Given these points, the claim that ""ASAN Service is a model for the world"" is somewhat subjective and context-dependent. It has strong merits and recognition but may not be universally applicable without modifications.

"Ülke nüfusu 1980 yılından bu yana 35 milyon artarken, aynı tarihte 85 milyon olan hayvan varlığı 2016 yılında 53 milyona gerilemiş, 1960’da 28,7 milyon hektar olan mera alanları ise 2016 yılında 14,6 milyon hektara düşmüştür.",true,tr,"While the country's population has increased by 35 million since 1980, the livestock population, which was 85 million at the same time, decreased to 53 million in 2016, and the pasture areas, which were 28.7 million hectares in 1960, fell to 14.6 million hectares in 2016.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The country's population increased by 35 million since 1980.
2. The livestock population was 85 million in 1980 and decreased to 53 million in 2016.
3. The pasture areas were 28.7 million hectares in 1960 and fell to 14.6 million hectares in 2016.

Without access to specific data sources or databases to verify these exact figures, I can only provide a general assessment based on the plausibility and typical trends observed in population growth, livestock population changes, and pasture area reduction over time.

1. Population growth: Many countries have experienced significant population growth since 1980, so an increase of 35 million is plausible.
2. Livestock population: Changes in livestock numbers can be influenced by various factors, including economic shifts, changes in agricultural practices, and environmental policies. A decrease from 85 million to 53 million over 36 years is plausible.
3. Pasture areas: Reduction in pasture areas is consistent with trends of urbanization, agricultural intensification, and land use changes. A decrease from 28.7 million hectares to 14.6 million hectares over 56 years is plausible.

Given that these trends are generally consistent with known patterns, the claim appears to be plausible. However, without specific data verification, I cannot confirm the exact figures.

The absenteeism rate in Imam Hatip schools has reached thirty percent and is heading towards a record,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Absenteeism Rate Data**: We need to check if there is reliable data indicating that the absenteeism rate in Imam Hatip schools is indeed 30%.
2. **Comparison with Other Schools**: We need to confirm if Imam Hatip schools have the highest absenteeism rate compared to other types of schools.
3. **Trend Analysis**: We need to see if there is evidence showing that the absenteeism rate is increasing and heading towards a record.

Without access to specific and up-to-date data on absenteeism rates in Imam Hatip schools and other schools, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on credible sources and data, we can make an educated assessment.

1. **United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)**: Adopted in 2003 and came into force in 2005. This is a significant international treaty aimed at combating corruption.

2. **African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption**: Adopted in 2003 and came into force in 2006. This is another significant agreement focused on the African continent.

3. **Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption**: Although adopted in 1999, it continued to gain signatories and ratifications during this period, but it does not count as being signed between 2003 and 2006.

4. **Council of Europe Civil Law Convention on Corruption**: Similar to the Criminal Law Convention, it was adopted in 1999 and does not fall within the specified period.

5. **Inter-American Convention against Corruption**: Adopted in 1996, it does not fall within the specified period.

6. **OECD Anti-Bribery Convention**: Adopted in 1997, it does not fall within the specified period.

Given the information, it appears that only two significant international agreements specifically aimed at combating corruption were signed between 2003 and 2006: the UNCAC and the African Union Convention. 

Therefore, the claim that seven significant international agreements were signed in this period is not supported by the available evidence.

Formula 1 race brings great economic dividends to our country,mostly false,az,Formula 1 race brings great economic dividends to our country.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Formula 1 race brings great economic dividends to our country,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Economic Impact Studies**: Numerous studies have shown that hosting a Formula 1 race can have significant economic benefits for the host country or city. These benefits often include increased tourism, job creation, and heightened global visibility.

2. **Tourism Boost**: Formula 1 races attract a large number of international visitors, which can lead to increased spending in hotels, restaurants, and other local businesses.

3. **Media Exposure**: The global broadcast of Formula 1 races provides substantial media exposure, which can enhance the country's image and attract future tourists and investors.

4. **Infrastructure Development**: Hosting a Formula 1 race often necessitates improvements in infrastructure, such as roads and public transportation, which can have long-term benefits for the local economy.

5. **Costs and Investments**: It's important to note that hosting a Formula 1 race also involves significant costs, including the fees paid to Formula 1, infrastructure investments, and operational expenses. The net economic impact can vary depending on how these costs are managed and the extent of the benefits realized.

Given these points, while there are substantial economic benefits associated with hosting a Formula 1 race, the extent of these benefits can vary based on specific circumstances and how effectively the event is managed.

1. **1977 Elections**: The Republican People's Party (CHP) did indeed win the 1977 general elections in Turkey, securing the highest number of votes and seats in the parliament. This is often referred to as a significant victory for the CHP.

2. **Historic Victory**: The 1977 elections are considered a historic victory for the CHP because it was one of the few times in recent history that they managed to come in first place.

3. **Last 55 Years**: If we consider the statement made in 2023, 55 years back would be 1968. The 1977 election is within this timeframe, and it is true that the CHP has not had many significant victories since then.

4. **Current Level**: The claim states that the current level (presumably referring to the performance of the CHP in recent elections) is below the level reached in 1977. To verify this, we would need to compare the percentage of votes and the number of seats won by the CHP in the 1977 elections with their performance in the most recent elections.

Without specific recent election data, it is challenging to make a precise comparison. However, if we assume that the CHP's recent performance has not surpassed their 1977 results, the claim could be considered accurate.

1. The employment figure when the speaker's administration began (19.6 million people).
2. The current employment figure (28 million 80 thousand people).

Without access to the specific data or context (such as the country, the time period, and the source of the employment statistics), it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the speaker is referring to a specific and verifiable context, we can analyze the claim based on the provided numbers.

Given the numbers provided:
- Initial employment: 19.6 million
- Current employment: 28.08 million

The claim states that employment increased from 19.6 million to 28.08 million. This represents a significant increase in employment.

If these figures are accurate and verifiable through reliable sources, the claim would be 'True'. However, without the ability to verify these numbers directly, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim based on the provided data.

CMK uyarınca Cumhurbaşkanı’na hakaret tutuklama nedenleri arasında değil,mostly true,tr,"According to the Criminal Procedure Code, insulting the President is not among the reasons for detention.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to refer to the specific provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) relevant to the jurisdiction in question. The CPC outlines the grounds for detention, which typically include reasons such as preventing the suspect from fleeing, preventing the destruction of evidence, or preventing the commission of further crimes.

Insulting the President may be covered under specific laws related to defamation, sedition, or other offenses, but it is not typically listed as a standalone reason for detention in the CPC. Detention for such an offense would generally fall under broader categories like maintaining public order or preventing further offenses.

Given this context, the claim that ""insulting the President is not among the reasons for detention"" is generally accurate, as the CPC does not usually specify this as a distinct reason for detention.

Ermənilərin Dağlıq Qarabağa köçürülməsi müharibə cinayətidir,true,az,'The resettlement of Armenians to Nagorno-Karabakh is a war crime.',"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The resettlement of Armenians to Nagorno-Karabakh is a war crime,"" we need to consider international law and the specific context of Nagorno-Karabakh.

1. **International Law**: According to the Fourth Geneva Convention, the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into the territory it occupies is prohibited and considered a war crime. This is intended to prevent changes in the demographic composition of the occupied territory.

2. **Nagorno-Karabakh Context**: Nagorno-Karabakh is a disputed region with a complex history involving both Armenian and Azerbaijani claims. The region declared independence from Azerbaijan in the early 1990s, leading to a prolonged conflict. The international community, including the United Nations, generally recognizes Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan, despite its de facto control by ethnic Armenians.

3. **Resettlement Dynamics**: If Armenians are being resettled into Nagorno-Karabakh by Armenia, and if this area is considered occupied territory under international law, such actions could be interpreted as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that many Armenians have historically lived in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the region has a significant Armenian population.

Given these points, the claim hinges on the interpretation of international law and the specific circumstances of the resettlement. If the resettlement is seen as an attempt to alter the demographic balance in an occupied territory, it could be considered a war crime. However, the historical presence of Armenians in the region adds complexity to this assessment.

1. **Political History**: Over the past 50 years, Turkey has experienced both single-party governments and coalition governments. Notable single-party periods include the rule of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) from 2002 onwards, and earlier periods under the Democratic Party (DP) in the 1950s and the Motherland Party (ANAP) in the 1980s. Coalition governments were common in the 1990s and early 2000s.

2. **Economic Growth Rates**: To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the average annual GDP growth rates during these periods. Historical data shows that Turkey's economy grew significantly during the AKP's single-party rule, particularly in the early 2000s. Conversely, the 1990s, characterized by coalition governments, were marked by economic instability and lower growth rates.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Studies and economic reports often highlight that Turkey's economic performance has been more robust under stable, single-party governments compared to coalition periods, which were frequently associated with political instability and economic challenges.

Given this context, the claim that Turkey's growth rate under single-party governments is twice that of coalition periods appears to be supported by historical economic data and political analysis. However, the exact figure of ""twice"" might be an oversimplification, as growth rates can vary significantly year by year and are influenced by numerous factors beyond the type of government.

1. **International Assessments**: According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report, Azerbaijan has made significant improvements in its infrastructure, including roads. The country has invested heavily in road construction and modernization projects.

2. **Local Reports**: Local sources and government reports often highlight the progress in road infrastructure, citing new highways and improved road conditions in urban and rural areas.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Experts acknowledge that while there have been substantial improvements, there are still areas, particularly in rural regions, where road quality may not meet the highest standards.

Given this information, the claim that ""Roads in Azerbaijan are built with high quality"" is generally supported by evidence, but there are still some areas that may not fully meet the highest quality standards.

1. **Historical Context**: Turkey has experienced various curfews over the years, often due to political unrest, military coups, or security operations, especially in regions with significant Kurdish populations.

2. **Recent Events**: The term ""New Turkey"" is often associated with the period following the rise of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's leadership, starting in the early 2000s. Since then, there have been several instances of curfews, particularly in response to security concerns and political unrest.

3. **Specific Instances**: For example, in 2015 and 2016, there were curfews in southeastern Turkey due to clashes between Turkish security forces and Kurdish militants. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Turkey imposed curfews and lockdowns to control the spread of the virus.

Given this information, the claim that this is the first curfew in 22 years is not accurate, as there have been multiple curfews within this period.

1. The 12-month current account deficit is 51.6 billion dollars.
2. This deficit is almost 6% of GDP, and in similar economies, the ratio is almost one-third of that level.

Let's break it down:

1. **Current Account Deficit**: 
   - If the 12-month current account deficit is indeed 51.6 billion dollars, this part of the claim would be accurate. This information can typically be verified through official economic reports or data from financial institutions.

2. **Percentage of GDP**:
   - To verify if 51.6 billion dollars is almost 6% of GDP, we need to know the GDP. If the GDP is approximately 860 billion dollars (since 51.6 billion is 6% of 860 billion), then this part of the claim would be accurate.

3. **Comparison with Similar Economies**:
   - The claim states that in similar economies, the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP is almost one-third of 6%, which is around 2%. This requires a comparison with the current account deficits of economies that are considered similar. If similar economies have current account deficits around 2% of their GDP, this part of the claim would be accurate.

Without specific data to verify these points, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim. Assuming the figures provided are accurate and the comparison with similar economies holds true, the claim would be:

1. The previous highest participation in an EXPO event was 30.
2. The participation in EXPO 2016 Antalya has reached 43.

If both points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If one of the points is slightly off but the general idea is correct, it might be 'Mostly True'. If there are significant inaccuracies, it could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Without specific historical data on previous EXPO events and the exact participation numbers for EXPO 2016 Antalya, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the information provided:

- If the previous highest participation was indeed 30 and EXPO 2016 Antalya reached 43, the claim is 'True'.
- If the previous highest participation was close to 30 but not exactly 30, and EXPO 2016 Antalya reached 43, the claim could be 'Mostly True'.
- If the participation numbers are significantly different, the claim could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact numbers, the most cautious approach would be to consider the claim as 'Half True' due to the potential for minor inaccuracies in the exact figures.

This information can typically be found in reports from government labor departments, economic research institutions, or business associations.

Without access to the specific data for the previous year, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we consider general trends and available data from recent years, SMBs often represent a significant portion of employment in many economies. For instance, in the United States, SMBs have historically accounted for a substantial share of employment, though the exact percentage can vary.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact figure of 76 percent, the most prudent classification based on general knowledge and trends would be:

1. **Economic Indicators**: These typically include GDP growth, inflation rates, unemployment rates, trade balances, and other macroeconomic metrics.
2. **Peer Countries**: This term usually refers to countries with similar economic structures, regional proximity, or developmental stages.
3. **Normalization Period**: This term is vague and could refer to different time frames, such as post-2008 financial crisis recovery, post-2016 coup attempt recovery, or post-COVID-19 pandemic recovery.

Without specific data and a clear definition of the ""normalization period,"" it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on general knowledge:

- **GDP Growth**: Turkey has experienced periods of strong GDP growth, but also significant volatility.
- **Inflation**: Turkey has struggled with high inflation rates, especially in recent years.
- **Unemployment**: Turkey's unemployment rate has been relatively high compared to some peer countries.
- **Trade Balance**: Turkey often runs a trade deficit, which is not necessarily a positive differentiation.

Given these mixed results across different economic indicators, the claim that Turkey positively differentiated in all economic indicators compared to all peer countries is likely an overstatement.

1. **Legal and Regulatory Environment**: Azerbaijan has stringent laws and regulations governing the activities of NGOs. These include requirements for registration, reporting, and obtaining grants, which can be cumbersome and restrictive.

2. **Freedom of Operation**: Reports from international organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International indicate that NGOs in Azerbaijan often face significant challenges, including government interference, harassment, and restrictions on freedom of assembly and expression.

3. **Funding and Resources**: Access to funding, especially from foreign sources, is heavily regulated. This can limit the financial independence and operational capacity of NGOs.

4. **Political Climate**: The political environment in Azerbaijan is generally not conducive to the free and independent operation of NGOs, particularly those that are critical of the government or focus on human rights issues.

Given these points, the claim that ""Every kind of opportunity and condition has been created for the activities of NGOs in Azerbaijan"" does not align with the documented challenges and restrictions faced by these organizations.

1. Whether the General Manager of CHP (Republican People's Party) appeared on television discussing the Kurdish issue.
2. Whether he claimed to have 17 solution proposals.
3. Whether he mentioned the first proposal but forgot the second one during the broadcast.
4. Whether it was later revealed that the actual number of proposals was 19, and he did not remember this either.

Without specific evidence or a reliable source to confirm these details, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, based on the structure and nature of the claim, it appears to be a detailed anecdote that would require corroboration from a credible source such as a news report or official statement.

(Türkiye) 34 yıl boyunca ya 2 haneli ya da 3 haneli enflasyon dönemlerini yaşadı... tek haneli rakam 2004 yılında görüldü...2012 yılında enflasyonda ulaşılan rakamın son 44 yılın en düşük oranı,true,tr,Turkey experienced either double-digit or triple-digit inflation periods for 34 years... single-digit figures were seen in 2004... the inflation rate reached in 2012 was the lowest in the last 44 years.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the historical inflation data for Turkey. Here are the key points to check:

1. **Double-digit or triple-digit inflation for 34 years**: Turkey experienced high inflation rates for several decades, particularly from the 1970s through the early 2000s. This period is characterized by persistent double-digit and sometimes triple-digit inflation rates.

2. **Single-digit inflation in 2004**: According to historical data, Turkey managed to bring inflation down to single digits in 2004, marking a significant achievement in its economic history.

3. **Lowest inflation rate in 2012 in the last 44 years**: The inflation rate in 2012 was relatively low compared to previous decades. However, to confirm it was the lowest in 44 years, we need to compare it with the rates from the late 1960s onwards.

Based on historical data:
- Turkey did experience high inflation for an extended period, particularly from the 1970s to the early 2000s.
- The inflation rate did drop to single digits in 2004.
- The inflation rate in 2012 was low, but whether it was the lowest in 44 years requires precise historical comparison.

Given the general accuracy of the first two points and the relative accuracy of the third point, the claim is largely correct but may slightly overstate the precision of the 2012 figure.

Now, let's calculate the ratio of midwives in the EU compared to Turkey:

\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{836}{252} \approx 3.32 \]

The claim states that the number of midwives in EU countries is ""more than three times higher"" than in Turkey. The calculated ratio of approximately 3.32 supports this statement.

This council typically deals with cooperation and coordination among member states' railway systems.

1. **Council for Railway Transport of the CIS and Baltic States**: This organization includes member countries from the CIS and Baltic States, focusing on railway transport cooperation.
2. **First Place**: The term ""first place"" could refer to various metrics such as total railway network length, efficiency, volume of freight transported, or passenger numbers.

Without specific, up-to-date data on these metrics, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if the claim is made by a specific country or railway company, it would be prudent to check recent reports or official statements from the Council for Railway Transport of the CIS and Baltic States.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were reports from various countries where people were indeed quarantined in hotels, including some 4 and 5-star establishments. This was particularly true for travelers returning from abroad who were required to quarantine and for whom governments or health authorities arranged accommodations in hotels to ensure proper isolation.

However, this practice was not universal and varied widely depending on the country, the availability of facilities, and the specific circumstances. In many cases, people were quarantined in a range of accommodations, not exclusively 4 and 5-star hotels.

Given this context, the claim is somewhat accurate but not universally applicable.

1. **Global Humanitarian Assistance Report**: According to the Global Humanitarian Assistance Report, Turkey has been noted for its significant contributions to humanitarian aid, particularly in response to the Syrian refugee crisis. Turkey has hosted millions of refugees and provided substantial aid.

2. **Percentage of GDP**: Turkey often ranks high in terms of humanitarian aid as a percentage of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This metric shows the relative generosity of a country compared to its economic size.

3. **Total Aid Volume**: In absolute terms, countries like the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom often contribute more in total volume of humanitarian aid. However, Turkey's contributions are still substantial.

4. **Reports and Rankings**: Various reports and rankings, such as those from the Development Initiatives and the United Nations, have highlighted Turkey's significant role in humanitarian aid, often placing it among the top contributors.

Given these points, while Turkey may not be the largest donor in absolute terms, it is often recognized as one of the most generous when considering the proportion of its GDP and its substantial efforts in specific crises.

1. **Economic Concerns**: Many parents are worried about the economic future of their children due to rising costs of education, housing, and healthcare. Economic instability and job market uncertainties are common concerns.

2. **Environmental Issues**: Climate change and environmental degradation are significant worries for many parents, as these issues directly impact the future quality of life for their children.

3. **Social and Political Climate**: The current social and political climate, including issues like social justice, political instability, and global conflicts, also contribute to parental anxiety about the future.

4. **Surveys and Studies**: Numerous surveys and studies indicate that a significant number of parents are indeed concerned about the future their children will face. For example, a Pew Research Center survey might show that a majority of parents worry about various aspects of their children's future.

Given these points, it is clear that many parents today do have concerns about the future of their children. Therefore, the claim that ""Nowadays people are not scared about the future of their children"" is not accurate.

Nature parks increased tenfold. The number of national parks also increased.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part with available data:

1. **Wetlands Area Increase**: The claim states that the area of wetlands increased from 9 million hectares to 30 million hectares. This would be a significant increase, but it requires verification from reliable sources such as environmental reports, government data, or scientific studies.

2. **Nature Parks Increase**: The claim mentions that nature parks increased tenfold. This also needs to be verified with data from relevant authorities or environmental organizations.

3. **National Parks Increase**: The claim states that the number of national parks has increased. Again, this requires verification from authoritative sources.

### Verification Process:

- **Wetlands Data**: According to global environmental reports, wetlands have been under threat due to urbanization, agriculture, and climate change. However, some regions may have specific initiatives to restore or increase wetland areas. Verification from national or international environmental agencies is necessary.

- **Nature Parks and National Parks Data**: The increase in nature parks and national parks can be verified through government records or environmental organizations' reports.

### Analysis:

- If the data supports that the area of wetlands has indeed increased from 9 million to 30 million hectares, and nature parks and national parks have seen significant increases, the claim could be considered accurate.
- If the data shows that wetlands are generally decreasing globally or in the specific region in question, the claim would be misleading.

### Conclusion:

Without specific data to verify each part of the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general trends and the need for precise data, the claim appears to be an overstatement or misrepresentation of the broader situation.

1. The number of families making a living from tobacco in 2002 and 2015.
2. Whether Turkey became a net importer of tobacco starting from 2012.

1. **Number of Families Making a Living from Tobacco:**
   - In 2002, the claim states that 405,882 families were making a living from tobacco.
   - By 2015, this number had decreased sevenfold to 56,000.

   To verify this, we would need access to specific agricultural and economic data from Turkey for those years. However, it is known that the number of tobacco farmers in Turkey has significantly decreased over the years due to various factors, including government policies and market changes.

2. **Turkey as a Net Importer of Tobacco:**
   - The claim states that starting from 2012, Turkey became a net importer of tobacco.

   This can be verified by looking at trade data. Turkey has historically been a significant producer of tobacco, but changes in production, consumption, and trade policies could have led to it becoming a net importer.

Given the information available and the general trends in the tobacco industry in Turkey, the claim seems plausible. However, without specific data to confirm the exact numbers and the year Turkey became a net importer, there is some uncertainty.

According to the BLS, the number of workplace fatalities in the United States has varied over the years. For instance, in recent years, the annual number of workplace fatalities has been around 5,000. If we take an average of 5,000 fatalities per year, over 14 years, this would result in approximately 70,000 fatalities, which is significantly higher than the 17,000 mentioned in the claim.

However, if the claim is referring to a specific country with a lower rate of workplace fatalities or a specific industry, the numbers could be different. Without additional context or specific data, it is challenging to verify the exact number.

Given the general data available from the BLS and the significant discrepancy between the average annual fatalities and the claim, the statement appears to be an underestimation.

1. **Radiation from an X-ray Machine:**
   - A single chest X-ray typically delivers a dose of about 0.1 millisieverts (mSv).
   - Other types of X-rays, such as dental X-rays, deliver even lower doses, while more complex imaging like CT scans can deliver higher doses (e.g., a CT scan of the abdomen can deliver around 10 mSv).

2. **Radiation from a Nuclear Power Plant:**
   - The average annual radiation dose to the public living near a nuclear power plant is very low, typically less than 0.01 mSv per year. This is due to stringent safety regulations and shielding that minimize radiation exposure.

Given these figures, the radiation dose from a single X-ray (0.1 mSv) is indeed higher than the annual radiation dose received by the public from living near a nuclear power plant (less than 0.01 mSv).

1. **Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)**: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan are all members of the EAEU, which is an economic union that facilitates trade and economic cooperation among its member states. This indicates direct economic cooperation.

2. **Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)**: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan are members of the CSTO, a military alliance that involves defense cooperation and mutual security arrangements. This indicates direct military cooperation.

3. **Bilateral Relations**: Each of these countries has established diplomatic relations with Armenia, which often includes various forms of bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade, culture, and education.

Nikol Pashinyan became the Prime Minister of Armenia in May 2018 following a series of mass protests known as the ""Velvet Revolution."" These protests were largely peaceful and aimed at ending the long-standing rule of the Republican Party and its leader, Serzh Sargsyan. Sargsyan had been President of Armenia for two terms and then moved to the position of Prime Minister, which many saw as an attempt to retain power. The protests led to Sargsyan's resignation and Pashinyan's eventual election as Prime Minister by the Armenian parliament.

A coup d'état typically involves a sudden and violent overthrow of a government, often by a small group, such as the military. The events in Armenia in 2018 were characterized by widespread public demonstrations and civil disobedience rather than a violent overthrow by a small group.

Given this context, the claim that ""a coup d'état occurred and Pashinyan came to power"" is not accurate. The process was more of a peaceful revolution rather than a coup d'état.

The claim states that the number in 2015 increased by more than double compared to 2005, reaching 2,867,828.

1. **Identify the number of unsolved cases in 2005**: Let's denote this number as \( X \).

2. **Calculate double the number of unsolved cases in 2005**: This would be \( 2X \).

3. **Compare the 2015 number to double the 2005 number**: The claim states that the 2015 number (2,867,828) is more than double the 2005 number.

For the claim to be true, the following inequality must hold:
\[ 2,867,828 > 2X \]

This simplifies to:
\[ X < 1,433,914 \]

Therefore, if the number of unsolved cases in 2005 was less than 1,433,914, the claim would be true.

Without the exact number of unsolved cases in 2005, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and the number of unsolved cases in 2005 was indeed less than 1,433,914, then the claim would be true.

dünyada azalan et fiyatları Türkiye'de artmaya devam ediyor.,true,tr,"Meat prices are decreasing worldwide, but they continue to rise in Turkey.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Meat prices are decreasing worldwide, but they continue to rise in Turkey,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Global Meat Prices**: We need to verify if there is a general trend of decreasing meat prices worldwide. This can be influenced by various factors such as supply chain improvements, changes in demand, or economic conditions.

2. **Meat Prices in Turkey**: We need to check if meat prices in Turkey are indeed rising. This could be due to local economic conditions, inflation, supply chain issues, or other country-specific factors.

### Analysis:

- **Global Meat Prices**: According to recent reports and data from organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global meat prices can fluctuate based on various factors. While there might be periods of decline, it is not universally true that meat prices are consistently decreasing worldwide. The trend can vary by region and type of meat.

- **Meat Prices in Turkey**: Turkey has been experiencing high inflation rates, which can affect the prices of goods, including meat. Reports from Turkish statistical agencies and news sources indicate that food prices, including meat, have been rising due to economic challenges, currency devaluation, and other local factors.

### Conclusion:

Given the complexity and variability of global meat prices, it is not entirely accurate to state that meat prices are decreasing worldwide without specific data supporting a consistent global trend.

"Türkiye, karbon salımı en çok artan ülkelerden birisi, hiçbir tedbir alınmıyor.",true,tr,"Turkey is one of the countries with the fastest-growing carbon emissions, and no measures are being taken.","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two parts: whether Turkey is one of the countries with the fastest-growing carbon emissions, and whether no measures are being taken to address this.

1. **Fastest-Growing Carbon Emissions**: Turkey has indeed been experiencing significant growth in carbon emissions. According to various reports and data from international organizations like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Bank, Turkey's carbon emissions have been increasing rapidly due to its economic growth, industrialization, and energy consumption patterns.

2. **Measures Being Taken**: The claim that no measures are being taken is not entirely accurate. Turkey has been taking steps to address carbon emissions, although the effectiveness and scale of these measures can be debated. For instance, Turkey has ratified the Paris Agreement and has been working on increasing renewable energy capacity, improving energy efficiency, and implementing policies aimed at reducing emissions. However, critics argue that these measures are not sufficient or are not being implemented quickly enough to make a significant impact.

Given this information, the claim that ""Turkey is one of the countries with the fastest-growing carbon emissions, and no measures are being taken"" is an overstatement. While Turkey's emissions are growing rapidly, it is not accurate to say that no measures are being taken at all.

Dört yılda Schengen Vizesi için ödenen meblağ 140 milyon Euro,mostly true,tr,The amount paid for the Schengen Visa in four years is 140 million Euros.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The amount paid for the Schengen Visa in four years is 140 million Euros,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Visa Fee Structure**: The standard Schengen Visa fee is €80 for adults and €40 for children aged 6 to 12. Some categories of applicants are exempt from the fee or pay a reduced fee.

2. **Number of Visas Issued**: The total number of Schengen Visas issued annually varies. For example, in 2019, approximately 15 million Schengen Visas were issued.

3. **Calculation**: If we assume an average fee of €80 per visa and consider the number of visas issued over four years, we can estimate the total revenue.

   - If 15 million visas are issued annually, over four years, that would be 60 million visas.
   - At €80 per visa, the total amount would be 60 million visas * €80 = €4.8 billion.

Given these points, the claim that the amount paid for the Schengen Visa in four years is 140 million Euros seems significantly lower than the estimated revenue based on the number of visas issued and the standard fee.

Türkiye’deki son 10 yıl değerlendirildiğinde... uyuşturucu... en az yüzde 200 arttı,mostly true,tr,When the last 10 years in Turkey are evaluated... drug use... has increased by at least 200%.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that drug use in Turkey has increased by at least 200% over the last 10 years, we would need to consult reliable sources such as government reports, studies by reputable organizations, or data from international bodies like the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

Without access to specific data or sources, it is challenging to verify the exact percentage increase in drug use. However, if we assume that the claim is based on credible data, it could be considered accurate. On the other hand, if there is no supporting evidence or if the data contradicts the claim, it would be considered false.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I would categorize it as:

Geçen yılki yüzde 4’lük büyüme, birçok yükselen ekonominin iki katından fazla.",mostly false,tr,An average growth of 5.4% was achieved between 2010 and 2014. Last year's 4% growth is more than double that of many emerging economies.,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""An average growth of 5.4% was achieved between 2010 and 2014.""
2. ""Last year's 4% growth is more than double that of many emerging economies.""

For the first part, if the data shows that the average growth rate between 2010 and 2014 was indeed 5.4%, then this statement is accurate.

For the second part, we need to compare the 4% growth rate to the growth rates of many emerging economies. If many emerging economies had growth rates of 2% or less, then the statement would be accurate.

Without specific data to verify these claims, we can only assess the logical consistency and general plausibility based on typical economic growth rates. Emerging economies often have varied growth rates, but many do experience growth rates around 2% or less, especially during economic downturns or periods of instability.

Given that both parts of the claim seem plausible but without concrete data to fully verify, the most appropriate assessment would be:

Türkiye'nin yükseköğrenim görmüş nüfusunun yaklaşık yüzde 4'ü yurt dışına gitmiştir.,mostly true,tr,Approximately 4% of Turkey's population with higher education has gone abroad.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Approximately 4% of Turkey's population with higher education has gone abroad,"" we need to look at reliable data sources such as reports from Turkish statistical agencies, international migration studies, or research papers on the topic.

1. **Data from Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat)**: TurkStat provides detailed statistics on education and migration. Checking their reports on higher education and emigration rates would be essential.

2. **OECD Reports**: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) often publishes data on international migration and education. Their reports could provide insights into the percentage of educated individuals from Turkey who have moved abroad.

3. **Academic Research**: Studies conducted by universities or research institutions on brain drain and migration patterns in Turkey could offer relevant statistics.

Without access to these specific data sources at this moment, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge and trends observed in similar contexts, the figure of 4% does not seem implausible but requires verification.

Given the lack of immediate access to precise data, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Türkiye Avrupa'nın birinci tarımsal gücü haline geldi,true,tr,Turkey has become the leading agricultural power in Europe.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey has become the leading agricultural power in Europe,"" we need to consider various factors such as agricultural output, productivity, and economic impact.

1. **Agricultural Output**: Turkey is indeed one of the largest agricultural producers in Europe. It is a major producer of various crops such as hazelnuts, cherries, figs, apricots, and pomegranates. It also has significant production in cereals, fruits, and vegetables.

2. **Economic Impact**: Agriculture is a significant part of Turkey's economy, contributing a substantial portion to its GDP and employing a large segment of its population.

3. **Comparison with Other European Countries**: While Turkey is a major agricultural producer, other European countries like France, Germany, and Italy also have strong agricultural sectors. France, for example, is known for its extensive agricultural output and is often considered a leading agricultural power in Europe.

Given these points, while Turkey is certainly a major agricultural power in Europe, it is not definitively the leading one when considering the overall agricultural landscape and economic impact in comparison to other European countries.

1. **Definition of ""vast majority""**: Generally, ""vast majority"" implies a very large proportion, typically more than 75-80%.
2. **Evidence of support**: We would need data or statements from opposition members indicating their support for the president's speech.

Without specific data or evidence showing that more than 75-80% of the opposition has indeed supported the president's speech, it is difficult to verify the claim as ""True"" or ""Mostly True.""

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the claim appears to be an overstatement.

"Ülkemizi 16 yılda 3,5 kat büyüterek, gelişmekte olan ülkeler arasında en ileriye çıkarttık.",mostly false,tr,"By growing our country 3.5 times in 16 years, we have advanced it to the forefront among developing countries.","To evaluate the claim ""By growing our country 3.5 times in 16 years, we have advanced it to the forefront among developing countries,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Economic Growth Measurement**: The claim suggests that the country's economy has grown 3.5 times over 16 years. This can be measured using GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data. We would need to verify the GDP figures from a reliable source such as the World Bank or International Monetary Fund (IMF) to confirm this growth rate.

2. **Comparison with Other Developing Countries**: The claim also states that this growth has advanced the country to the forefront among developing countries. This requires a comparative analysis with other developing countries' growth rates over the same period. We would need to look at economic indicators such as GDP growth rates, GDP per capita, Human Development Index (HDI), and other relevant metrics.

3. **Context and Definition**: The term ""forefront among developing countries"" is somewhat subjective. It could mean leading in terms of economic size, growth rate, or overall development. Clarifying this context is essential for an accurate assessment.

Without specific data and context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general knowledge and typical economic growth patterns, a 3.5 times increase over 16 years is significant but not unprecedented. Many developing countries have experienced rapid growth, especially in Asia and Africa.

**Hypothetical Analysis**:
- If the country's GDP indeed grew 3.5 times in 16 years, it would imply an average annual growth rate of around 7.5%, which is high but achievable for rapidly developing economies.
- To be at the ""forefront,"" the country would need to be among the top performers in terms of growth and development indicators.

Given these considerations, and assuming the growth rate is accurate but the term ""forefront"" is somewhat subjective and potentially overstated:

Tek haneli enflasyonu Türkiye’de hemen birkaç yıl içerisinde gördük.,mostly true,tr,"When I started as the minister responsible for the Treasury in 2002, interest rates in Turkey were at 66%. Inflation was at 29%. The country had experienced double-digit inflation for 35 years. We saw single-digit inflation in Turkey within just a few years.","To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. **Interest Rates in 2002**: The claim states that interest rates in Turkey were at 66% in 2002.
2. **Inflation Rate in 2002**: The claim states that inflation was at 29% in 2002.
3. **Historical Inflation**: The claim states that Turkey had experienced double-digit inflation for 35 years.
4. **Single-Digit Inflation Achievement**: The claim states that Turkey achieved single-digit inflation within a few years after 2002.

### Verification:

1. **Interest Rates in 2002**:
   - In 2002, Turkey was indeed experiencing very high interest rates. The overnight lending rate was around 62% in early 2002, which is close to the 66% mentioned.

2. **Inflation Rate in 2002**:
   - According to historical data, Turkey's inflation rate in 2002 was approximately 29.7%, which aligns closely with the claim.

3. **Historical Inflation**:
   - Turkey had experienced high inflation rates for several decades. From the late 1970s through the early 2000s, Turkey's inflation was often in the double digits, and sometimes even higher.

4. **Single-Digit Inflation Achievement**:
   - By 2004, Turkey's inflation rate had dropped to single digits, reaching around 9.3%. This indicates that within a few years of 2002, Turkey did achieve single-digit inflation.

### Conclusion:
The claim is largely accurate based on historical economic data. The interest rates and inflation rates mentioned are close to the actual figures, and the historical context of prolonged high inflation is correct. Additionally, Turkey did achieve single-digit inflation within a few years.

1. **Number of Sports Clubs in Turkey**: The claim states that Turkey has over 13,000 sports clubs.
2. **Comparison with Developed Countries**: Developed countries typically have a higher number of sports clubs due to larger populations, more established sports infrastructures, and greater emphasis on sports and recreational activities.

For instance:
- **Germany**: As of recent data, Germany has over 90,000 sports clubs.
- **United Kingdom**: The UK has tens of thousands of sports clubs, with estimates often exceeding 150,000.
- **United States**: The US has a vast number of sports clubs, with estimates in the hundreds of thousands when including all types of sports and recreational clubs.

Given these comparisons, the claim that 13,000 sports clubs in Turkey is very low compared to developed countries appears to be accurate.

According to the World Bank, the global extreme poverty rate (people living on less than $1.90 a day) has seen significant reductions over the past few decades. In 2000, the global extreme poverty rate was approximately 28%. By 2019, this rate had decreased to around 9.2%. This represents a significant reduction, but not a tenfold decrease.

A tenfold decrease would imply that the poverty rate would need to be reduced to 2.8% (one-tenth of 28%). Since the actual reduction is from 28% to 9.2%, this is a substantial improvement but not to the extent claimed.

1. **Economic Growth Rate**: According to data from the World Bank and other economic sources, Turkey's GDP growth rate has varied significantly over the years. While there have been periods of high growth, the average growth rate over the past decade is closer to 3-4%, not consistently 5%.

2. **Energy Demand Increase**: Turkey's energy demand has indeed been increasing, and various reports, including those from the International Energy Agency (IEA), indicate that the annual increase in energy demand has been around 5-6% in recent years.

3. **Ambitious Climate Target**: Turkey has made commitments to combat climate change, including ratifying the Paris Agreement in 2021 and setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the ambition and effectiveness of these targets have been subjects of debate among experts.

Given these points, the claim contains some accurate information but also some exaggerations or inaccuracies, particularly regarding the economic growth rate.

2. **Context**: Understanding the specific conflict or situation being referred to, including the role of the opposition and other contributing factors.
3. **Verification**: Cross-referencing the claim with available statistics and reports on internally displaced persons (IDPs).

Without specific details about the conflict or opposition in question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the context involves a well-documented conflict where the opposition's activities are a significant factor in displacement, we can make an informed judgment.

For instance, in conflicts like the Syrian Civil War, opposition activities have indeed contributed to large-scale displacement, but attributing the displacement solely to the opposition without considering other factors (such as government actions, international interventions, etc.) would be misleading.

Given the complexity and the need for precise context, the claim might be an oversimplification but not entirely baseless.

2. **Transparency**: Were the election procedures and results openly available for scrutiny? Were there independent observers who could verify the process?
3. **International Compliance**: Did the elections meet international standards for democratic elections, as set by organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)?

Without specific information or evidence regarding the conduct of the April elections in question, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that there were credible reports from independent observers and international organizations confirming the democratic, transparent, and compliant nature of the elections, the claim could be considered accurate.

İham Əliyev Azərbaycanda etnik-dini tolerantlığın olduğunu deyib,mostly true,az,Ilham Aliyev has said that there is ethnic and religious tolerance in Azerbaijan.,"To evaluate the claim made by Ilham Aliyev regarding ethnic and religious tolerance in Azerbaijan, we need to consider various factors, including the country's policies, international reports, and the experiences of different ethnic and religious groups within Azerbaijan.

1. **Government Policies and Statements**: The Azerbaijani government officially promotes a narrative of ethnic and religious tolerance. Azerbaijan is a secular state with a majority Muslim population, and it has laws that protect religious freedom and the rights of ethnic minorities.

2. **International Reports**: Various international organizations, such as the U.S. Department of State and Human Rights Watch, have reported on the state of religious and ethnic tolerance in Azerbaijan. These reports often highlight both positive aspects and areas of concern. For example, while Azerbaijan generally allows the practice of different religions and has a history of relatively peaceful coexistence among various ethnic groups, there have been instances of discrimination and restrictions, particularly against political dissenters and certain religious groups.

3. **Ethnic and Religious Groups**: Azerbaijan is home to several ethnic minorities, including Lezgins, Talysh, Armenians, and others. The country also has a variety of religious communities, including Muslims (both Shia and Sunni), Christians, Jews, and others. While many of these groups coexist peacefully, there have been reports of tensions and discrimination, particularly against the Armenian minority due to the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Given this context, the claim that there is ethnic and religious tolerance in Azerbaijan is partially supported by the government's official stance and some positive aspects of coexistence. However, there are also documented instances of discrimination and restrictions that suggest the situation is not entirely as positive as the claim might imply.

1. **Check Recent Data**: Look up the latest food inflation statistics from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the UK, or equivalent bodies in other countries.
2. **Contextual Factors**: Consider the time frame and geographical location mentioned in the claim. Food inflation rates can vary significantly by country and over different periods.
3. **Cross-Verification**: Compare the claim with multiple sources to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Without access to real-time data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if the most recent and reliable data from a credible source confirms that food inflation is indeed at 16%, then the claim would be 'True'.

The labor force participation rate (LFPR) is the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking employment. Historically, the LFPR in the United States has fluctuated. For example, it peaked around 67.3% in early 2000 and has seen various changes since then.

As of recent data (up to 2023), the LFPR has not reached the peak levels seen in the early 2000s. It has been recovering from the lows experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic but has not surpassed historical highs.

Given this context, the claim that the labor force participation rate has reached an ""unprecedentedly high level"" is not accurate.

1. **Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic**: Known for its spa resorts and historical significance, Karlovy Vary is a popular tourist destination. However, it is not one of the most expensive cities in the Czech Republic. Real estate prices here are generally lower compared to major cities like Prague.

2. **Sulutəpə, Baku, Azerbaijan**: Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, has seen significant real estate development and price increases in recent years. Sulutəpə, being a suburb of Baku, might have lower prices compared to the city center but could still be relatively high due to its proximity to the capital.

Given these points, it is plausible that real estate prices in Karlovy Vary are cheaper than in Sulutəpə, considering the general trends in both regions.

The term ""fragile five"" was coined by Morgan Stanley in 2013 to describe five emerging market economies that were considered particularly vulnerable to external shocks, especially due to their reliance on foreign investment to finance growth. The original ""fragile five"" countries were:

1. Brazil
2. India
3. Indonesia
4. South Africa
5. Turkey

To evaluate the claim, we need to check if any of these countries have been replaced or if Turkey's status has changed since the term was introduced.

1. **Brazil**: Brazil has faced economic challenges but remains part of the original group.
2. **India**: India has shown significant economic improvement and is often no longer considered part of the ""fragile"" group.
3. **Indonesia**: Indonesia has also made economic strides and is sometimes excluded from the list in recent analyses.
4. **South Africa**: South Africa continues to face economic difficulties and is often still included in the group.
5. **Turkey**: Turkey has consistently faced economic and political challenges, maintaining its status as a vulnerable economy.

Given this information, it appears that Turkey is indeed the only country among the original ""fragile five"" that has consistently remained in discussions about economic vulnerability.

1. **Historical Context**: The European Parliament has indeed passed several resolutions concerning Azerbaijan, often focusing on human rights, democratic standards, and the rule of law. These resolutions have sometimes been critical of the Azerbaijani government.

2. **Nature of Resolutions**: Whether these resolutions are ""unfair"" is subjective and depends on one's perspective. From the viewpoint of the Azerbaijani government, these resolutions might be seen as unfair or biased. However, from the perspective of the European Parliament and many international observers, these resolutions are based on documented concerns about human rights and governance issues in Azerbaijan.

3. **Leading Role**: The term ""taken the lead"" implies that the European Parliament is the primary or most active body in this regard. While the European Parliament is indeed vocal, other international organizations and bodies, such as the United Nations and various human rights NGOs, also issue reports and statements about Azerbaijan.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but is also subjective and potentially biased. The European Parliament has been active in passing resolutions critical of Azerbaijan, but whether these are ""unfair"" is a matter of perspective.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been a prominent political figure in Turkey, serving as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and then as President from 2014 onwards. As of 2023, he has been President for more than 8 years. The claim specifies a 5.5-year term, which would place the event around early 2020.

To verify if Erdoğan exercised his veto power for the first time during this period, we would need to check historical records of his use of veto power. If it is confirmed that he did indeed veto a law for the first time during his 5.5-year term as President, the claim would be accurate.

Given the information available and the need for precise historical verification, the claim appears to be plausible but requires confirmation from reliable sources.

Öğrencilere sağlanan kredi ve burs imkânları 2002’den bu yana yüzde 789 oranında arttı.,mostly false,tr,The opportunities for loans and scholarships provided to students have increased by 789% since 2002.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The opportunities for loans and scholarships provided to students have increased by 789% since 2002,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. **Data on Loans and Scholarships in 2002**: We need to know the baseline number of opportunities for loans and scholarships available to students in 2002.
2. **Current Data on Loans and Scholarships**: We need the most recent data on the number of opportunities for loans and scholarships available to students.
3. **Calculation of Percentage Increase**: We need to calculate the percentage increase based on the data from 2002 and the most recent data.

Without access to specific data sources or statistical reports that confirm this exact percentage increase, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided and the need for specific data to substantiate the claim, the most appropriate response would be:

Bütün strateji regional layihələr Ermənistandan yan keçib,half true,az,All strategic regional projects have bypassed Armenia.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""All strategic regional projects have bypassed Armenia,"" we need to consider the context and specific examples of regional projects in the South Caucasus and surrounding areas.

1. **Energy Projects**: Major energy projects like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline and the Southern Gas Corridor, which includes the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum (BTE) gas pipeline, have indeed bypassed Armenia. These projects connect Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, and are significant for regional energy transportation.

2. **Transportation Projects**: The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway is another strategic project that bypasses Armenia, connecting Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, and providing a direct rail link between the Caspian Sea and Europe.

3. **Geopolitical Considerations**: Armenia's geopolitical situation, including its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh and its closed borders with Turkey, has contributed to its exclusion from these projects.

4. **Exceptions**: However, Armenia is involved in some regional initiatives, such as the North-South Road Corridor, which aims to connect Iran to Georgia through Armenia. Additionally, Armenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), which includes Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, and participates in various regional economic activities within this framework.

Given this context, while many significant regional projects have bypassed Armenia, it is not accurate to say that ""all"" strategic regional projects have done so.

1. **Turkey's Ranking for Alcoholic Beverage Prices in Europe**:
   - According to Eurostat, Turkey is indeed one of the most expensive countries in Europe for alcoholic beverages. However, the exact ranking can vary depending on the year and the specific data set used.

2. **Special Consumption Tax (ÖTV) Increases**:
   - Based on OECD data, the claim that the Special Consumption Tax (ÖTV) on rakı has increased by 443% and on beer by 365% over the past 10 years needs to be verified. If these figures are accurate, it would support the claim.

3. **Turkey's Global Ranking for Alcohol Tax Rates**:
   - The claim that Turkey ranks 6th in the world for the highest alcohol tax rates also needs to be verified against reliable sources such as OECD or other international tax comparison reports.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data verification, let's break down the claim:

- **Eurostat Data**: Turkey is indeed among the most expensive countries in Europe for alcoholic beverages, but the exact ranking (3rd) needs to be confirmed.
- **OECD Data on ÖTV Increases**: If the percentage increases (443% for rakı and 365% for beer) are accurate, this part of the claim holds.
- **Global Ranking for Alcohol Tax Rates**: Turkey's position as 6th in the world for the highest alcohol tax rates needs to be confirmed with up-to-date data.

Without access to the most current and specific data points, it is challenging to confirm every detail with absolute certainty. However, based on the general trends and available information, the claim appears to be largely accurate but may have some minor discrepancies in exact figures or rankings.

Can’t an MP have a Porsche?,mostly false,az,Can't a Member of Parliament have a Porsche?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Can't a Member of Parliament have a Porsche?"", we need to consider the context and the underlying assumptions.

1. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: There are no specific laws or regulations that prohibit a Member of Parliament (MP) from owning a Porsche or any other luxury vehicle. MPs, like any other citizens, have the right to purchase and own property, including cars, as long as they do so within the bounds of the law.

2. **Financial Capability**: MPs typically receive a salary and allowances that could potentially allow them to afford a luxury car like a Porsche, depending on their financial management and other sources of income.

3. **Public Perception and Ethical Scrutiny**: While legally permissible, owning a luxury car might attract public scrutiny or ethical questions, especially if the MP is perceived to be living extravagantly while representing constituents who may be facing economic hardships. However, this does not change the fact that they can legally own such a vehicle.

Given these points, the claim is factually accurate in a legal and practical sense, though it may be subject to public opinion and ethical debate.

1. **Global Context**: In various countries, 2019 saw significant judicial and legal reforms. For example:
   - In the United States, there were ongoing discussions and some legislative actions related to criminal justice reform, including the implementation of the First Step Act, which aimed to reduce recidivism and reform sentencing laws.
   - In the European Union, there were efforts to strengthen the rule of law and judicial independence in member states, particularly in response to concerns about judicial reforms in countries like Poland and Hungary.
   - In other regions, such as Latin America and Asia, there were also notable judicial reforms aimed at improving transparency, efficiency, and accountability in the legal system.

2. **Specific Examples**:
   - **United States**: The First Step Act, signed into law in December 2018, began to be implemented in 2019, marking a significant step in criminal justice reform.
   - **European Union**: The EU continued to address rule of law issues, particularly in Poland, where judicial reforms were seen as undermining judicial independence.
   - **Other Countries**: Various countries undertook reforms to address corruption, improve judicial efficiency, and enhance legal protections for citizens.

Given these examples, it is reasonable to say that 2019 was a year of notable judicial and legal reforms in various parts of the world. However, the extent and impact of these reforms varied by country and region.

People were forced to rely on roadways, and accidents increased.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific figures and context provided:

1. **Railway Passenger Numbers**:
   - The claim states that 74 million people were transported by railways in Turkey in 2002.
   - It also states that this number dropped to 46 million in 2013.

2. **Reliance on Roadways and Accidents**:
   - The claim suggests that due to the decrease in railway passengers, people were forced to rely on roadways, leading to an increase in accidents.

To verify these points, we would need access to official transportation statistics from Turkey for the years 2002 and 2013, as well as data on road traffic accidents for the same period.

Based on available data and historical context:
- The figures for railway passengers in Turkey have fluctuated over the years, but a significant drop from 74 million to 46 million would be notable and should be documented in official transportation reports.
- The correlation between decreased railway usage and increased road accidents is plausible but would require specific accident statistics to confirm.

Without access to the exact data, we can make an educated assessment based on the plausibility and available historical trends.

**Assessment**:
- The claim about the number of railway passengers seems plausible but needs verification.
- The correlation between decreased railway usage and increased road accidents is logical but also needs statistical backing.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact numbers and the correlation, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not fully substantiated.

1. The ratio of detainees to those in prisons was 54% in 2001.
2. The ratio has decreased to 14.5% today.
3. In the European Union, this ratio is over 20%.

Without access to specific data sources or statistics, I cannot definitively verify these numbers. However, I can provide an analysis based on the information given.

1. The claim that the ratio was 54% in 2001 seems specific and could be accurate if it is based on reliable data.
2. The decrease to 14.5% today also seems plausible if there have been significant changes in detention and prison policies over the years.
3. The statement that the ratio in the European Union is over 20% is a comparative claim that could be true if EU countries have different detention and prison systems.

Given that the claim provides specific figures and a comparative context, it appears to be well-structured and plausible. However, without concrete data to verify each point, I would rate the claim as 'Mostly True' because it seems largely accurate but may lack complete verification.

1. ""We have doubled the number of beds in hospitals since 2002.""
2. ""We currently have a capacity of 227,000 beds.""
3. ""We have also increased the number of qualified beds from 19,000 to 127,000.""

Let's analyze each part:

1. Doubling the number of beds since 2002:
   - If the number of beds has doubled, the number of beds in 2002 would have been around 113,500 (since 227,000 / 2 = 113,500).

2. Current capacity of 227,000 beds:
   - This is a straightforward statement that can be verified with current data.

3. Increase in qualified beds from 19,000 to 127,000:
   - This implies a significant increase in the number of qualified beds, which can be checked against historical and current data.

Without access to specific historical data and current statistics, it's challenging to verify these claims definitively. However, if we assume the numbers provided are accurate and based on reliable data sources, the claim appears to be consistent and plausible.

According to various reports, including statements from Azerbaijani officials and international news sources, Azerbaijan has indeed provided aid to multiple countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, Azerbaijan has sent medical supplies and financial assistance to countries such as Italy, China, Iran, and several others. Additionally, Azerbaijan has contributed to international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) to support global efforts against the pandemic.

Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Azerbaijan has provided aid to more than 10 countries during the coronavirus period.

The Southern Gas Corridor is a major initiative aimed at transporting gas from the Caspian region, specifically Azerbaijan, to Europe. The project includes several key components:
1. The South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) extension.
2. The Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP).
3. The Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP).

The total cost of the Southern Gas Corridor project has been estimated to be around $40 billion (USD), which is approximately 34-35 billion euros, depending on the exchange rate. This figure includes investments from various stakeholders, including international financial institutions, private companies, and governments.

Given that the claim states ""up to 50 billion euros,"" it appears to be an overestimation compared to the widely reported figures. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains some elements of truth.

(Türkiye) kişi başına düşen milli gelirde Japonya ve AB ortalamasının yüzde 50-60'ına ulaştı.,mostly false,tr,Turkey has reached 50-60% of Japan and the EU average in terms of per capita national income.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey has reached 50-60% of Japan and the EU average in terms of per capita national income,"" we need to compare the per capita national income (often measured as GDP per capita) of Turkey with that of Japan and the EU.

1. **Turkey's GDP per capita**: According to the World Bank, Turkey's GDP per capita in 2021 was approximately $9,539.

2. **Japan's GDP per capita**: According to the World Bank, Japan's GDP per capita in 2021 was approximately $39,285.

3. **EU's GDP per capita**: According to Eurostat, the EU's GDP per capita in 2021 was approximately €32,000, which is roughly $37,000 when converted to USD.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of Turkey's GDP per capita relative to Japan and the EU:

- **Relative to Japan**: 
  \[
  \frac{9,539}{39,285} \approx 0.243 \text{ or } 24.3\%
  \]

- **Relative to the EU**: 
  \[
  \frac{9,539}{37,000} \approx 0.258 \text{ or } 25.8\%
  \]

Turkey's GDP per capita is approximately 24.3% of Japan's and 25.8% of the EU's. This is significantly below the 50-60% range mentioned in the claim.

The whole world has determined this, the EU has determined this. International organizations have determined this,"" we need to consider various sources and reports on press freedom in Turkey.

1. **Press Freedom Rankings and Reports**:
   - **Reporters Without Borders (RSF)**: In their World Press Freedom Index, Turkey has consistently ranked poorly. For example, in 2022, Turkey was ranked 149th out of 180 countries, indicating significant issues with press freedom.
   - **Freedom House**: In their Freedom of the Press report, Turkey is often categorized as ""Not Free"" or ""Partly Free,"" highlighting severe restrictions on media and journalists.
   - **Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)**: CPJ has frequently reported on the imprisonment of journalists in Turkey, making it one of the top jailers of journalists globally.

2. **European Union (EU)**:
   - The EU has expressed concerns over press freedom in Turkey. In various reports and statements, the EU has criticized Turkey for its treatment of journalists and media outlets, particularly following the 2016 coup attempt and subsequent crackdowns.

3. **International Organizations**:
   - Various international human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have documented and criticized the Turkish government's actions against the press.

Given this information, the claim that there is no press freedom in Turkey is supported by multiple credible sources. However, the statement ""the whole world has determined this"" is a bit of an overstatement, as not every country or organization may have explicitly stated this. Nonetheless, the overwhelming consensus among major international bodies and reports supports the claim.

1. The number of honey forests in Turkey.
2. Turkey's ranking in global honey production.

1. **Number of Honey Forests in Turkey:**
   - According to various sources, Turkey has been actively increasing its number of honey forests. As of recent reports, Turkey has indeed established a significant number of honey forests, and the figure of 227 honey forests is consistent with the information available.

2. **Turkey's Ranking in Global Honey Production:**
   - Turkey is known to be one of the top producers of honey in the world. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other industry reports, Turkey is often cited as the second-largest honey producer globally, following China.

Given that both points in the claim are supported by available data, the claim appears to be accurate.

Without access to specific data and analysis for that period, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and comprehensive data, it could be considered 'True'.

1. **Air Quality Data**: Check recent air quality reports and data from reliable sources such as government environmental agencies, international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), or reputable environmental monitoring organizations.

2. **Health Impact Studies**: Look for studies or reports that specifically address the health impacts of air pollution in Bolu and Düzce provinces.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Consider statements or assessments from environmental scientists or public health experts regarding the air quality in these regions.

Without access to specific and up-to-date data, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if recent reports and expert analyses indicate that air pollution levels in these provinces are indeed high and pose a health risk, the claim could be considered accurate.

Merkez Bankası'nın rezervi 120 milyar dolar. Bu güç onları ürkütüyor.,mostly false,tr,The Central Bank's reserves are 120 billion dollars. This power scares them.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The Central Bank's reserves are 120 billion dollars.""
2. ""This power scares them.""

For the first part, the accuracy depends on the specific central bank being referred to and the most recent data available. Central bank reserves can fluctuate due to various factors such as foreign exchange interventions, changes in the value of reserve assets, and economic policies. Without specifying which central bank and the date of the data, it's challenging to verify this claim precisely.

For the second part, ""This power scares them,"" it is a subjective statement. It implies that someone is scared of the central bank's reserves, but it does not specify who ""they"" are. This makes it difficult to verify as it is based on interpretation and opinion rather than factual data.

Given the lack of specific information and the subjective nature of the second part of the claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize the entire statement as true or false.

1. **Global Poverty Thresholds**: The World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than $1.90 per day (adjusted for purchasing power parity, PPP). This threshold was updated from $1.25 per day in 2015, but for the context of 2012, the $1.25 per day threshold was commonly used.

2. **Poverty Statistics in 2012**: According to the World Bank and other global organizations, a significant number of people were living below the $1.25 per day threshold in 2012. The global poverty rate was around 12.7% in 2012, which translates to hundreds of millions of people living in extreme poverty.

3. **Verification**: Given the data from reputable sources like the World Bank, it is clear that there were indeed citizens living on less than $1.00 and $2.15 per day in 2012.

Based on this information, the claim that ""By the end of 2012, there were no citizens living on less than 1 dollar or 2.15 dollars"" is not supported by the data.

However, the effectiveness of sunlight in killing the virus depends on various factors such as the intensity and duration of exposure, the type of surface, and environmental conditions. Sunlight is not a guaranteed or immediate method for deactivating the virus, and it is not a substitute for other preventive measures like wearing masks, social distancing, and hand hygiene.

1. **Date and Announcement**: On August 25, 2019, there were indeed reports that Iran's Ministry of Intelligence announced the discovery of CIA spies. This aligns with the date and the nature of the announcement mentioned in the claim.

2. **Discovery of Spies**: The Iranian government has made several claims about uncovering espionage networks, including those allegedly linked to the CIA. There have been multiple instances where Iran has announced the capture of spies, and these announcements have been reported by various news outlets.

3. **Involvement of Armed Forces' Information Protection**: The claim mentions the involvement of the armed forces' information protection in identifying the spies. While specific details about the involvement of the armed forces are not always disclosed, it is plausible that such operations would involve multiple security agencies.

Given the complexity and sensitivity of such issues, it is often challenging to assert with absolute certainty that no cases have occurred, especially considering underreporting, lack of transparency, and potential biases in record-keeping. Human rights organizations frequently report instances of torture and inhumane treatment in various countries, even if official records do not reflect these cases.

Without specific data to confirm or refute the claim, it is prudent to approach it with caution. Therefore, based on the general understanding that such issues are often underreported or not officially acknowledged, the claim is likely to be inaccurate.

1. **Official Statements**: Turkish officials, including those from the Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB), have made statements in recent years indicating that Turkey has significantly increased its domestic production capabilities for defense equipment and ammunition. For example, in 2021, the head of the SSB, Ismail Demir, stated that Turkey meets around 70% of its defense needs domestically.

2. **Defense Industry Reports**: Reports from defense industry analysts and publications have noted Turkey's substantial investments in its defense sector, leading to increased self-sufficiency. Turkey has developed and produced a range of military equipment, including drones, tanks, and naval vessels, which supports the claim of high domestic production.

3. **Historical Context**: Over the past two decades, Turkey has made a concerted effort to reduce its reliance on foreign military imports. This has been driven by both strategic considerations and the desire to boost the national defense industry.

Given the consistency of these sources and the lack of significant contradictory evidence, the claim appears to be well-supported.

Ilham Aliyev sees the multiparty system as a fundamental principle of democratic development of Azerbaijan,mostly false,az,Ilham Aliyev sees the multiparty system as a fundamental principle of democratic development of Azerbaijan.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Ilham Aliyev sees the multiparty system as a fundamental principle of democratic development of Azerbaijan,"" we need to consider both his public statements and the actual political environment in Azerbaijan.

1. **Public Statements**: Ilham Aliyev, the President of Azerbaijan, has made statements supporting the idea of a multiparty system and democratic development. Officially, Azerbaijan is a republic with a multiparty system.

2. **Political Environment**: Despite these statements, the political environment in Azerbaijan has been criticized for lacking genuine democratic practices. Reports from international organizations like Freedom House and Human Rights Watch indicate that the country has significant issues with political freedoms, including restrictions on opposition parties, media censorship, and unfair electoral processes.

Given this context, while Aliyev may publicly endorse the concept of a multiparty system, the practical implementation and the political realities in Azerbaijan suggest a different picture.

After the launch of the ASAN Visa an increase of 1 million tourist visas have been witnessed in Azerbaijan,mostly false,az,"After the launch of the ASAN Visa, an increase of 1 million tourist visas has been witnessed in Azerbaijan.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""After the launch of the ASAN Visa, an increase of 1 million tourist visas has been witnessed in Azerbaijan,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The launch date of the ASAN Visa system.
2. The number of tourist visas issued before and after the launch.
3. Reliable sources or official statistics confirming the increase.

The ASAN Visa system was launched by Azerbaijan to simplify the process of obtaining a visa for tourists. If official statistics or credible sources confirm that there has indeed been an increase of 1 million tourist visas since the launch, the claim would be true. However, without specific data or sources, it is challenging to verify the exact number.

1. **Historical Context**: The Republic's history likely refers to a specific country, but without additional context, let's assume it refers to a country with a significant history of road construction.

2. **First Period (79 years)**: The claim states that only 6,000 kilometers of road were built in 79 years. This would need to be verified against historical records of road construction in the country in question.

3. **Second Period (12 years)**: The claim states that 17,000 kilometers of road were built in 12 years. This would also need to be verified against more recent records of road construction.

4. **Comparison**: The claim makes a direct comparison between the two periods, suggesting a significant increase in road construction in the more recent 12-year period.

To accurately assess the claim, we would need access to reliable historical and recent data on road construction in the country being referenced. Without specific data, we can only make a general assessment based on the plausibility of such a claim.

Given the significant difference in the numbers, it is plausible that advancements in technology, increased funding, and prioritization of infrastructure could lead to a substantial increase in road construction in a shorter period. However, without concrete data, we cannot definitively verify the claim.

1. The total number of people dismissed from public service by decree laws.
2. The number of those dismissed who were specifically from educational and higher education institutions.

If the total number of people dismissed is approximately 134,532 (since 41,705 is 31% of 134,532), and if it is confirmed that 41,705 of those dismissed were indeed from educational and higher education institutions, then the claim would be accurate.

"2002 yılından beri Türkiye ekonomisinin seyrine bakıldığı zaman, hedeflerin büyük oranda tutturulmuş olduğunu görüyoruz.",mostly false,tr,"When we look at the course of the Turkish economy since 2002, we see that the targets have largely been met.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""the targets have largely been met"" for the Turkish economy since 2002, we need to consider various economic indicators and targets set by the Turkish government over this period. 

1. **Economic Growth**: Turkey experienced significant economic growth in the early 2000s, with GDP growth rates often exceeding 5%. However, growth has been more volatile in recent years, with periods of recession and slower growth.

2. **Inflation**: Inflation has been a persistent issue. While it was brought under control in the early 2000s, it has surged again in recent years, reaching double digits.

3. **Unemployment**: Unemployment rates have fluctuated, with some periods of improvement but also significant increases, particularly in recent years.

4. **Currency Stability**: The Turkish lira has experienced significant depreciation, particularly in the last decade, which has affected economic stability.

5. **Foreign Investment**: There was a surge in foreign investment in the early 2000s, but political instability and economic challenges have reduced investor confidence in recent years.

6. **Government Debt**: Turkey managed to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio in the early 2000s, but it has been rising again in recent years.

Given these mixed results, it is clear that while some targets were met, particularly in the early years, many have not been sustained or achieved in recent years. Therefore, the claim that ""the targets have largely been met"" is an oversimplification.

"Berlin, Paris, Tokyo, Londra ne kadar güvenliyse Türkiye'nin şehirleri de o kadar güvenlidir.",mostly false,tr,"Turkey's cities are as safe as Berlin, Paris, Tokyo, and London.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Turkey's cities are as safe as Berlin, Paris, Tokyo, and London,"" we need to consider various factors such as crime rates, safety indices, and general perceptions of safety in these cities.

1. **Crime Rates**: Crime rates can vary significantly between cities and countries. For instance, Tokyo is often cited as one of the safest major cities in the world, with very low crime rates. Berlin, Paris, and London have higher crime rates compared to Tokyo but are generally considered safe by global standards. Turkish cities like Istanbul and Ankara have varying crime rates, and while they may be safe in many areas, they might not consistently match the safety levels of Tokyo.

2. **Safety Indices**: Various organizations and studies publish safety indices that rank cities based on factors like crime, healthcare, infrastructure, and personal safety. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Safe Cities Index, cities like Tokyo, London, and Paris often rank higher than major Turkish cities.

3. **Perception of Safety**: Public perception of safety can also differ. Tourists and residents might feel safer in some cities compared to others based on their experiences and media reports.

Given these considerations, while some Turkish cities may offer a level of safety comparable to Berlin, Paris, and London in certain aspects, they generally do not match the overall safety levels of Tokyo. Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization.

1. Whether air traffic in Diyarbakır has increased tenfold in the last 10 years.
2. Whether the number of people transported has increased from below 200,000 to over 2 million.

If both points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If one point is accurate but the other is not, it would be 'Half True'. If both points are somewhat accurate but not entirely, it could be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the degree of accuracy.

Without specific data to verify these points, we can only make an educated guess based on the information provided. However, for a definitive answer, we would need access to historical and current air traffic data for Diyarbakır.

Given the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on accurate data, it seems plausible that air traffic could have increased significantly over a decade, and an increase from below 200,000 to over 2 million would indeed represent a tenfold increase.

Azərbaycan Avropanın enerji təhlükəsizliyini təmin edən əsas ölkələrdən biridir,false,az,Azerbaijan is one of the main countries ensuring Europe's energy security.,"To evaluate the claim that ""Azerbaijan is one of the main countries ensuring Europe's energy security,"" we need to consider Azerbaijan's role in the European energy market.

1. **Energy Exports**: Azerbaijan is a significant exporter of oil and natural gas. The country has substantial reserves and has been developing its energy sector to increase exports to Europe.

2. **Infrastructure**: The Southern Gas Corridor, which includes the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), is a major infrastructure project that transports Caspian gas from Azerbaijan to Europe. This corridor is crucial for diversifying Europe's energy sources and reducing dependency on Russian gas.

3. **Market Share**: While Azerbaijan is an important supplier, it is not the largest. Countries like Russia, Norway, and Algeria have historically been more significant suppliers of natural gas to Europe. However, Azerbaijan's role has been growing, especially in the context of European efforts to diversify energy sources.

4. **Strategic Importance**: Given the geopolitical context and Europe's push for energy diversification, Azerbaijan's contribution is strategically significant, even if its market share is smaller compared to some other suppliers.

Considering these points, Azerbaijan plays a notable role in contributing to Europe's energy security, particularly through its natural gas exports and strategic infrastructure projects. However, it is not the largest or the only major player in this regard.

Son 17 ildə Azərbaycanda səhiyyə xərcləri 20 dəfəyədək artıb,mostly true,az,"In the last 17 years, healthcare expenditures in Azerbaijan have increased by up to 20 times.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that healthcare expenditures in Azerbaijan have increased by up to 20 times in the last 17 years, we need to examine reliable data sources such as government reports, international health expenditure databases, and credible news articles.

1. **Government Reports and Budgets**: Reviewing Azerbaijan's official budget reports over the past 17 years would provide concrete figures on healthcare spending.
2. **International Databases**: Organizations like the World Bank, WHO, and OECD often track healthcare expenditures by country and can provide historical data.
3. **News Articles and Analysis**: Credible news sources and economic analyses might discuss trends in healthcare spending in Azerbaijan.

Without access to these specific data points, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on credible sources, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the significant economic changes and development in Azerbaijan over the past two decades, a substantial increase in healthcare spending is plausible. However, an increase of up to 20 times is quite substantial and would need strong evidence to support it.

**Hypothetical Data Analysis**:
- If healthcare spending was $100 million 17 years ago, a 20-fold increase would mean it is now $2 billion.
- If healthcare spending was $200 million 17 years ago, a 20-fold increase would mean it is now $4 billion.

**Conclusion**:
Without specific data, we can only hypothesize. However, based on general economic trends and the significant nature of a 20-fold increase, it seems somewhat exaggerated but not entirely implausible.

"AKP’ye en çok oy çıkan yerler, deprem riskinin en yüksek olduğu yerler",mostly false,tr,The places where the AKP receives the most votes are the places with the highest earthquake risk.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The places where the AKP receives the most votes are the places with the highest earthquake risk,"" we need to consider both the voting patterns for the AKP (Justice and Development Party) in Turkey and the geographical distribution of earthquake risks.

1. **AKP Voting Patterns**: The AKP has historically received strong support in various regions of Turkey, including both urban and rural areas. Their support base is particularly strong in central Anatolia, parts of the Black Sea region, and southeastern Turkey.

2. **Earthquake Risk in Turkey**: Turkey is situated on several active fault lines, making it prone to earthquakes. The most significant earthquake risks are along the North Anatolian Fault (which affects areas like Istanbul and the Marmara region), the East Anatolian Fault, and the Aegean region.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - **Marmara Region**: This region, including Istanbul, has high earthquake risk but is politically diverse. The AKP has significant support here, but it is not uniformly dominant.
   - **Central Anatolia**: This region has strong AKP support but is not the highest in earthquake risk compared to the Marmara and Aegean regions.
   - **Eastern Anatolia**: This region has both high earthquake risk and significant AKP support, but it is not the only region with high earthquake risk.

Given this information, the claim oversimplifies the relationship between AKP voting patterns and earthquake risk areas. While there are overlaps, the highest earthquake risk areas are not exclusively or predominantly the places where the AKP receives the most votes.

We also had some fluctuations, around 1% to 2%.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details about the depreciation of the Iranian and Russian currencies, as well as the fluctuations mentioned.

1. **Iranian Currency Depreciation**: The Iranian rial has experienced significant depreciation over the years due to various factors, including economic sanctions and internal economic issues. A 48% loss in value is plausible, but it would need to be verified against specific time frames and data sources.

2. **Russian Currency Depreciation**: The Russian ruble has also faced depreciation, particularly during periods of economic sanctions and geopolitical tensions. A 13% loss in value is within a reasonable range for certain periods, but again, it would need to be verified against specific data.

3. **Fluctuations of 1% to 2%**: This part of the claim is vague without specifying which currency or time frame is being referred to. However, minor fluctuations of 1% to 2% are common in many currencies over short periods.

Given the general plausibility of the figures but the lack of specific time frames and data verification, the claim can be considered as having a basis in truth but lacking precise context.

1. The number of doctors per ten thousand people in OECD countries.
2. The number of doctors per ten thousand people in the country in question.
3. The number of doctors per ten thousand people in Greece.

According to the latest available data from the OECD, the average number of doctors per ten thousand people in OECD countries is indeed around 37. 

For the country in question, the claim states there are 17 doctors per ten thousand people. This figure would need to be verified against the most recent and reliable national health statistics.

For Greece, the claim states there are 72 doctors per ten thousand people. According to OECD data, Greece has one of the highest numbers of doctors per capita among OECD countries, and the figure of 72 is consistent with recent data.

Given that the numbers for OECD countries and Greece are accurate, and assuming the figure for the country in question is also accurate based on national statistics, the claim appears to be well-supported.

In most real-world scenarios, creating truly equal conditions for everyone is extremely challenging due to various factors such as socio-economic disparities, historical inequalities, access to resources, and individual differences. While efforts can be made to level the playing field, complete equality in conditions is rarely, if ever, fully realized.

Given this understanding, the claim is likely to be an overstatement.

The claim states that Turkey did not shrink during a serious balancing process due to increased exports and decreased imports, and that the last two quarterly growth figures support this.

1. **Increased Exports and Decreased Imports**: If Turkey indeed increased its exports and decreased its imports, this would generally contribute positively to the GDP, as net exports (exports minus imports) are a component of GDP calculation.

2. **Economic Growth Figures**: The claim mentions that the last two quarterly growth figures demonstrated that Turkey did not shrink. To verify this, we would need to look at the official GDP growth rates for the last two quarters. If these figures show positive growth, it would support the claim.

Without the specific data at hand, we can only make a general assessment based on typical economic principles and the structure of the claim.

- If the data shows positive GDP growth for the last two quarters, the claim would be supported.
- If the data shows negative GDP growth or contraction, the claim would be refuted.

Given the structure of the claim and assuming the data supports it:

1. **Democracy in Turkey**: The statement by Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu that ""There is no democracy in Turkey"" is a subjective political opinion. The state of democracy can be assessed through various lenses, including freedom of the press, judicial independence, and the fairness of elections. International organizations like Freedom House and The Economist Intelligence Unit have raised concerns about the state of democracy in Turkey, often rating it as ""partly free"" or a ""hybrid regime."" However, this is a nuanced issue and not an absolute fact.

2. **Election Participation Rates**: The claim that election participation rates in Europe are around 45%, 50%, 55% and that Turkey's participation rate is around 87% can be fact-checked with data. According to various sources, voter turnout in European countries varies widely. For example, in the 2019 European Parliament elections, the average turnout was about 50.66%. In national elections, turnout rates can be higher or lower depending on the country. Turkey's voter turnout in recent elections has indeed been high, often exceeding 80%.

Given these points:
- The statement about democracy is subjective and open to interpretation.
- The comparison of voter turnout rates is generally accurate.

Sərbəst toplaşma haqqında” Qanunda Konstitusiyaya zidd şərtlər sui-istifadəyə imkan yaradır,true,az,"The conditions in the ""Law on Freedom of Assembly"" that contradict the Constitution create opportunities for abuse.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The conditions in the 'Law on Freedom of Assembly' that contradict the Constitution create opportunities for abuse,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Constitutional Contradictions**: If the ""Law on Freedom of Assembly"" contains provisions that are in direct conflict with the Constitution, this could indeed create legal ambiguities and potential for misuse. Constitutions typically provide fundamental rights and freedoms, and any subordinate law that contradicts these rights can be problematic.

2. **Opportunities for Abuse**: When laws are not aligned with the Constitution, it can lead to arbitrary enforcement or selective application, which can be considered abuse. For example, authorities might exploit these contradictions to suppress dissent or target specific groups unfairly.

3. **Legal Precedents and Interpretations**: Courts often play a role in interpreting both the Constitution and any conflicting laws. If there are established legal precedents where courts have identified and addressed such contradictions, it would support the claim.

Given these considerations, if there are indeed conditions in the ""Law on Freedom of Assembly"" that contradict the Constitution, it is reasonable to assert that this creates opportunities for abuse. However, without specific examples or legal analysis, the extent of this abuse can vary.

Without specific information or access to legislative records, it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the claim.

1. **1975-1980 Period**: This period in Turkey was marked by significant political instability, economic challenges, and high inflation rates. The country faced a severe economic crisis, leading to high unemployment and low growth rates.

2. **2015-2020 Period**: This period also saw economic challenges, including a currency crisis in 2018, high inflation, and fluctuating growth rates. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 further exacerbated economic difficulties, leading to increased unemployment and negative growth.

To verify the claim, we would need to compare specific data points such as GDP growth rates and unemployment rates for both periods. However, based on historical context:

- The 1975-1980 period is widely recognized as one of the most challenging economic times in Turkey's history.
- The 2015-2020 period also faced significant economic issues, but it is debatable whether it was worse than the 1975-1980 period without specific data comparisons.

Given the historical context and the severity of the 1975-1980 economic crisis, the claim that the 2015-2020 period is the worst 5 years in Turkey's history, excluding 1975-1980, seems to be an overstatement.

1. **Food Production**: Azerbaijan has a diverse agricultural sector, producing grains, fruits, vegetables, and livestock. The country has made significant investments in agriculture to boost production.

2. **Imports**: Azerbaijan also imports food products to meet its population's needs. The balance between domestic production and imports is crucial for food security.

3. **Food Security Reports**: According to various international organizations, Azerbaijan generally maintains a stable food supply. However, like many countries, it can face challenges such as natural disasters, economic fluctuations, or geopolitical issues that might temporarily affect food availability.

4. **Recent Events**: Any recent events such as conflicts, economic sanctions, or natural disasters could impact the food supply. As of the latest information available, there have been no significant disruptions reported that would severely affect the food supply in Azerbaijan.

Considering these points, the claim that ""There is enough food supply in Azerbaijan"" appears to be generally accurate, though it is subject to change based on future events and ongoing conditions.

"YAP can call snap elections any time, the Constitution allows this",mostly false,az,"YAP can call snap elections any time, the Constitution allows this.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""YAP can call snap elections any time, the Constitution allows this,"" we need to consider the specific constitutional provisions and legal framework governing the calling of snap elections by YAP (presumably a political party or entity).

1. **Constitutional Provisions**: Constitutions typically outline the conditions under which snap elections can be called. This often involves specific procedures, such as a vote of no confidence, dissolution of parliament by the head of state, or other legal mechanisms. It is unlikely that any constitution would allow a political party to unilaterally call snap elections without following these procedures.

2. **Role of Political Parties**: Political parties themselves generally do not have the authority to call elections. This power usually resides with the head of state, head of government, or a legislative body, depending on the country's specific constitutional arrangements.

Given these points, the claim that ""YAP can call snap elections any time, the Constitution allows this"" is highly unlikely to be accurate without additional context or specific constitutional provisions that are exceptionally unusual.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Bizə siyahıtutma ilə bağlı irad tutan yoxdur,false,az,No one is criticizing us regarding the census.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""No one is criticizing us regarding the census,"" we need to consider whether there is any evidence of criticism about the census. If there is any criticism, the claim cannot be entirely true.

1. **True**: There is absolutely no criticism from any source.
2. **Mostly True**: There is very minimal or insignificant criticism.
3. **Half True**: There is a balanced amount of both criticism and support.
4. **Mostly False**: There is significant criticism, but not overwhelming.
5. **False**: There is substantial and widespread criticism.

Given that it is highly unlikely that there is zero criticism regarding a public matter like the census, the claim is likely not 'True'. The level of criticism would determine if it is 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Without specific evidence, but based on the general nature of public discourse, it is reasonable to assume that there is some level of criticism. Therefore, the claim ""No one is criticizing us regarding the census"" is likely to be inaccurate.

İnkişaf etmiş Avropa ölkələrindən qat-qat yaxşı vəziyyətdəyik,true,az,We are in a much better situation than developed European countries.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are in a much better situation than developed European countries,"" we need to consider various factors such as economic indicators, healthcare systems, quality of life, political stability, and other relevant metrics. 

1. **Economic Indicators**: Developed European countries generally have high GDP per capita, low unemployment rates, and strong social safety nets. If the country making the claim has lower GDP per capita or higher unemployment rates, the claim may not hold.

2. **Healthcare Systems**: Many developed European countries have robust healthcare systems with high life expectancy and low infant mortality rates. Comparing healthcare quality and accessibility is crucial.

3. **Quality of Life**: This includes factors like education, infrastructure, environmental quality, and social services. Developed European countries often rank high in global quality of life indices.

4. **Political Stability**: Developed European countries typically have stable political environments, which contribute to overall societal well-being.

Without specific data or context about the country making the claim, it is challenging to definitively assess the situation. However, given the general high standards in developed European countries across these metrics, the claim is likely to be an overstatement.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
dünyanın hiçbir ülkesinde Cumhurbaşkanı ayrı bir hukuksal korumaya bürünmüyor.,false,tr,In no country in the world does the President receive separate legal protection.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In no country in the world does the President receive separate legal protection,"" we need to consider the legal frameworks and protections afforded to presidents in various countries.

1. **United States**: The President has certain legal immunities while in office, such as protection from civil suits for actions taken in an official capacity.
2. **France**: The President enjoys immunity from prosecution during their term, except for cases of high treason.
3. **Russia**: The President has immunity from prosecution for actions taken while in office.
4. **Italy**: The President has immunity from prosecution for actions taken in the exercise of their duties.

These examples indicate that several countries do provide separate legal protections for their presidents, often in the form of immunity from prosecution for actions taken while in office.

"İzmir-İstanbul Otoyolu, 9 milyar, finans maliyetiyle birlikte 9 milyar... Türkiye’nin 1950 yılındaki milli gelirinden büyük.",mostly false,tr,"The İzmir-Istanbul Highway, with a cost of 9 billion including financing costs, is greater than Turkey's national income in 1950.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare the cost of the İzmir-Istanbul Highway with Turkey's national income in 1950.

1. **Cost of the İzmir-Istanbul Highway**: The claim states that the cost is 9 billion, including financing costs.

2. **Turkey's National Income in 1950**: According to historical economic data, Turkey's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1950 was approximately $2.9 billion (in 1950 USD).

Given that the cost of the highway is 9 billion (assuming this is in contemporary USD), and Turkey's national income in 1950 was $2.9 billion, the cost of the highway is indeed greater than Turkey's national income in 1950.

17 yılda depremle ilgili 58 araştırma önergesi vermişiz. (Parlamento olarak) AK Parti ve MHP milletvekilleri ‘hayır depremi araştırmaya gerek yok’ demişler.,half true,tr,"'In 17 years, we have submitted 58 research proposals related to earthquakes. (As Parliament) AK Party and MHP deputies have said 'no, there is no need to investigate the earthquake.''","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The number of research proposals related to earthquakes submitted in the past 17 years.
2. The voting behavior of AK Party and MHP deputies regarding these proposals.

If the claim is that 58 research proposals related to earthquakes were submitted and that AK Party and MHP deputies consistently voted against investigating these proposals, we need to check historical records of parliamentary activities, including proposal submissions and voting records.

Given the complexity and specificity of this claim, it would require access to detailed parliamentary records and voting data over the past 17 years. Without access to these records, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable data and there is no significant evidence to the contrary, we can make an educated assessment.

"Daxili işlər orqanlarında xidmətə qəbul şəffaflıq, aşkarlıq və ədalət prinsipləri əsasında keçirilir",half true,az,"Recruitment into the internal affairs bodies is conducted based on the principles of transparency, openness, and fairness.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Recruitment into the internal affairs bodies is conducted based on the principles of transparency, openness, and fairness,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Official Policies and Regulations**: Many countries have official policies that mandate recruitment processes in internal affairs bodies to be transparent, open, and fair. These policies are often documented in public records and official guidelines.

2. **Implementation and Practice**: Even if policies exist, the actual implementation can vary. There may be instances where recruitment processes are not as transparent, open, or fair as intended due to corruption, nepotism, or other factors.

3. **Public Perception and Reports**: Reports from watchdog organizations, media, and public perception can provide insights into whether the recruitment processes are genuinely transparent, open, and fair.

Given that the claim is a general statement and does not specify a particular country or context, it is challenging to definitively categorize it without more specific information. However, based on the general understanding that while many countries strive for these principles, the actual practice can sometimes fall short, the claim can be considered partially accurate.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
Çıkıyor siyasi parti başkanları ‘Dökülün sokağa’ diyor. Bunu demokratik hak gibi takdim ediyor. Böyle bir demokratik hak yok,false,tr,Political party leaders are saying 'Take to the streets.' They present this as a democratic right. There is no such democratic right.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context of democratic rights and the right to protest.

In many democratic countries, the right to peaceful assembly and protest is enshrined in law. For example, in the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution protects the right to peaceably assemble. Similarly, the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 11, protects the right to freedom of assembly and association.

However, the specifics can vary by country, and there may be legal restrictions on how and where protests can occur. These restrictions are typically in place to ensure public safety and order.

Given this context, the claim that ""There is no such democratic right"" to take to the streets is generally inaccurate because many democratic systems do recognize and protect the right to peaceful protest.

"...bu iktidar, ekonominin can suyu olan tasarrufları Türkiye Cumhuriyeti tarihinin en düşük seviyesine indirmiştir.",mostly false,tr,"This government has reduced the savings, which are the lifeblood of the economy, to the lowest level in the history of the Republic of Turkey.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""This government has reduced the savings, which are the lifeblood of the economy, to the lowest level in the history of the Republic of Turkey,"" we need to examine historical data on savings rates in Turkey.

1. **Historical Context**: The Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923. Therefore, the claim implies a comparison across nearly a century of economic data.
2. **Savings Rate Data**: Savings rates can be measured in various ways, such as household savings rates, national savings rates, or gross domestic savings as a percentage of GDP. Reliable sources for this data include the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
3. **Current Government**: The claim refers to the current government, which would need to be specified. As of the latest information, the government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been in power since 2003, with various economic policies implemented over the years.

To verify the claim, we would need to:
- Access historical savings rate data for Turkey.
- Compare the current savings rates to historical lows.
- Consider the context of economic policies and external factors influencing savings rates.

Without specific data at hand, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent trends and available data, we can make an informed judgment.

**Analysis**:
- If recent data shows a significant drop in savings rates to historically low levels, the claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If savings rates are low but not the lowest in history, the claim could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.
- If savings rates are not at historically low levels, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, a cautious approach would be to categorize the claim based on the likelihood of recent trends.

"760,000 people could be unemployed",mostly false,az,"760,000 people could be unemployed.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""760,000 people could be unemployed,"" we need to consider the context and the source of the information. The phrase ""could be"" indicates a possibility rather than a certainty, which makes the claim inherently speculative. 

If the claim is based on a credible source, such as a government report, economic forecast, or a study by a reputable organization, and if the number 760,000 is within a reasonable range given the context, then the claim could be considered accurate within the bounds of its speculative nature.

However, without specific context or source information, it's challenging to fully verify the claim. Given the speculative nature of the phrase ""could be,"" the claim is not asserting a definitive fact but rather a potential outcome.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Namizədlərin ən asan qeydiyyatı Azərbaycandadır,false,az,The easiest registration for candidates is in Azerbaijan.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The easiest registration for candidates is in Azerbaijan,"" we need to consider various factors such as the registration process, requirements, and comparisons with other countries.

1. **Registration Process**: The ease of registration can depend on the number of steps involved, the documentation required, and the time it takes to complete the process.
2. **Requirements**: This includes eligibility criteria, fees, and any other prerequisites that candidates must fulfill.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: To claim that Azerbaijan has the easiest registration, we would need to compare its process with those of other countries.

Without specific data or a comprehensive comparison of candidate registration processes across multiple countries, it is challenging to definitively state that Azerbaijan has the easiest registration process. 

Given the lack of detailed comparative information, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

Bir çox kateqoriyadan olan insanlar dövlət tərəfindən mənzillə təmin olunurlar,half true,az,People from many categories are provided with housing by the state.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""People from many categories are provided with housing by the state,"" we need to consider the context and the general practices of state-provided housing.

State-provided housing typically includes various programs aimed at different groups of people. These groups often include low-income families, the elderly, people with disabilities, veterans, and sometimes other specific categories such as victims of domestic violence or homeless individuals. The extent and specifics of these programs can vary significantly by country and even by region within a country.

Given that state-provided housing generally does cater to a variety of groups, the claim that ""People from many categories are provided with housing by the state"" is broadly accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Avrupa’da bir partinin yüzde 41 alması bir hayaldir.,false,tr,"In Europe, it is a dream for a party to receive 41 percent.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In Europe, it is a dream for a party to receive 41 percent,"" we need to consider the context of European political systems and election results.

1. **Political Systems**: Many European countries have multi-party systems, which often result in coalition governments. In such systems, it is less common for a single party to receive a very high percentage of the vote because the vote is typically spread across multiple parties.

2. **Election Results**: Historical election data from various European countries can provide insight. For example:
   - In Germany, the CDU/CSU received around 32.9% of the vote in the 2021 federal election.
   - In France, Emmanuel Macron's La République En Marche! received about 32.3% in the first round of the 2017 legislative elections.
   - In the UK, the Conservative Party received 43.6% of the vote in the 2019 general election, which is an exception but still within the realm of possibility.

3. **Exceptions**: There are instances where parties have received around or above 41%, but these are not the norm in most European countries with proportional representation or multi-party systems.

Given this context, the claim that it is a ""dream"" for a party to receive 41 percent is somewhat exaggerated but not entirely without basis. It is challenging but not impossible.

2002'den bugüne kadar öğrenci sayısı 1 buçuk milyondan 5 buçuk milyona yükseldi.,mostly true,tr,"Since 2002, the number of students has increased from 1.5 million to 5.5 million.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Since 2002, the number of students has increased from 1.5 million to 5.5 million,"" we need to verify the data regarding student numbers from 2002 to the present. 

Without specific data to confirm or refute the exact figures mentioned in the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, the increase from 1.5 million to 5.5 million represents a significant growth.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, but assuming it is based on accurate information, the claim appears plausible.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
Habur'dan Irak'a günde 7 bin TIR geçiyor.,false,tr,"7,000 trucks pass through Habur to Iraq daily.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""7,000 trucks pass through Habur to Iraq daily,"" we need to consider available data and reports on the traffic through the Habur border crossing between Turkey and Iraq.

The Habur border gate is one of the busiest land border crossings in the region, primarily used for commercial trade between Turkey and Iraq. However, the exact number of trucks passing through can vary based on economic conditions, political situations, and other factors.

As of the latest available data, the number of trucks passing through the Habur border crossing has been reported to be significant, but specific numbers can fluctuate. Some reports have indicated figures in the range of several thousand trucks per day, but consistently reaching 7,000 trucks daily would be on the higher end of these estimates.

Given the variability and the lack of consistent, up-to-date verification for the exact number of 7,000 trucks daily, the claim may be somewhat exaggerated but not entirely implausible.

"HDP, Türkiye’nin en yoksul mahallelerinden, İstanbul’un en fukara semtlerinden oy almıştır.",true,tr,HDP has received votes from Turkey's poorest neighborhoods and the most impoverished districts of Istanbul.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""HDP has received votes from Turkey's poorest neighborhoods and the most impoverished districts of Istanbul,"" we need to consider the voting patterns and demographics of the HDP (Peoples' Democratic Party) in Turkey.

1. **HDP's Voter Base**: The HDP is known for its strong support among Kurdish populations and left-leaning voters. It has also garnered support from various marginalized groups, including the economically disadvantaged.

2. **Geographical Support**: The HDP has significant support in southeastern Turkey, where many Kurdish people live, and these areas are often economically disadvantaged. Additionally, in major cities like Istanbul, the HDP has received votes from diverse districts, including some of the poorer neighborhoods.

3. **Election Data**: Analysis of election results and demographic data shows that the HDP has indeed received substantial support from economically disadvantaged areas, both in southeastern Turkey and in poorer districts of Istanbul.

Given this information, the claim aligns well with the known voting patterns and demographic support for the HDP.

Çelişkiye bakınız ki, Dünyada gıda ürünleri ucuzlarken, bizde artmaktadır.",mostly true,tr,"Food prices in the world have decreased by 20% in one year. Ironically, while food products are getting cheaper globally, they are increasing in our country.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. **Global Food Prices Decrease**: The claim states that food prices worldwide have decreased by 20% in one year. This would require verification from reliable sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the World Bank, or other reputable economic reports that track global food prices.

2. **Local Food Prices Increase**: The claim also states that while global food prices are decreasing, food prices in the specific country are increasing. This would require local data from national statistics agencies, economic reports, or other credible sources that track food prices within the country.

Without specific data to verify these points, we can only assess the claim based on general trends and available information up to the knowledge cutoff in 2023. Historically, food prices can vary significantly due to factors like local economic conditions, supply chain issues, inflation, and government policies.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data to confirm both parts of the claim, the most accurate assessment without further information would be:

1. **Vocational High Schools**: According to the latest data from the Turkish Ministry of National Education, vocational and technical education schools constitute a significant portion of the high school system. However, the exact percentage can vary slightly depending on the source and the year of the data.

2. **Imam Hatip Schools**: These are a specific type of vocational school with a focus on religious education. The proportion of imam hatip schools has been reported to be around 13-14% in various educational reports and statistics.

Given the available data, the claim that vocational high schools make up 44% and imam hatip schools make up around 13-14% seems to be in line with the general statistics, though exact figures can vary slightly.

1. **Presidential Residence**: The President of the United States resides in the White House, not a ""presidential palace.""
2. **Rent**: The President does not pay rent to live in the White House. The residence is provided as part of the office.
3. **Food Expenses**: While the President and their family do not pay for official state functions, they do pay for their personal groceries and meals.
4. **Guest Meals**: When guests visit the White House, the cost of meals for official events is covered by the government. However, personal guests' meals might be paid for by the President, but not necessarily at the rates of a 5-star hotel.

Given these points, the claim is largely incorrect.

OECD ülkeleri arasında işsizlik şampiyonuyuz.,false,tr,We are the champions of unemployment among OECD countries.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are the champions of unemployment among OECD countries,"" we need to verify the current unemployment rates among OECD countries and see if the country in question has the highest unemployment rate.

The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) regularly publishes unemployment statistics for its member countries. As of the most recent data, countries like Spain, Greece, and Turkey have historically had higher unemployment rates compared to other OECD countries. 

If the country making the claim is not one of these countries with the highest unemployment rates, then the claim would be inaccurate. 

Without specific data from the latest OECD reports, it is challenging to definitively confirm the claim. However, based on historical trends and typical unemployment rates among OECD countries, it is unlikely that a country not typically known for high unemployment would suddenly become the ""champion"" of unemployment.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there are credible sources or official statements from SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic) or relevant authorities confirming this pricing strategy.
2. **Context and Comparison**: Understand what the 20% lower price is being compared to. Is it compared to international prices, regional prices, or previous prices within Azerbaijan?
3. **Current Data**: Ensure that the information is up-to-date and reflects the current pricing strategy of SOCAR.

Without access to specific and current data, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable source or official statement, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

1. **CHP (Republican People's Party) Rule:**
   - The CHP was in power alone from the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 until 1950.
   - Ankara University was indeed established in 1946 during the CHP's rule.

2. **AK Party (Justice and Development Party) Rule:**
   - The AK Party has been in power since 2002.
   - During the first 13 years of AK Party rule (2002-2015), a significant number of universities were established. According to various sources, over 100 new universities were indeed established during this period.

Given these points, the claim that only Ankara University was established during the 25 years of CHP rule is accurate. Additionally, the claim that over 100 universities were established during the first 13 years of AK Party rule is also accurate.

This information is typically available through industry reports, financial statements, or market analysis from reputable sources.

Without access to the specific market share data for ""Pasha Insurance"" and ""Pasha Holding,"" it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date market data, it could be evaluated as follows:

- **True**: If verified data shows that ""Pasha Insurance"" and ""Pasha Holding"" together control more than 50% of the insurance market.
- **Mostly True**: If they control slightly less than 50%, but close enough that the claim is nearly accurate.
- **Half True**: If they control around 50%, but not definitively more.
- **Mostly False**: If they control a significant portion, but well below 50%.
- **False**: If they control a much smaller portion of the market, far from 50%.

1. **Council of Europe**: The Council of Europe has 47 member states, which include almost all European countries.
2. **Electronic Courts**: These are systems that allow judicial processes to be conducted electronically, including filing cases, accessing court documents, and other legal procedures.
3. **Mobile Application**: The claim specifies a mobile application, which means the system must be accessible via mobile devices.

To verify this claim, we would need to check:
- The introduction dates of similar mobile applications in other member states.
- Official announcements or records from the Council of Europe or relevant judicial bodies.

Without specific data or records to confirm or refute the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the statement is made by a credible source and no other member state has publicly contested it, we might lean towards it being accurate but with some caution due to the lack of concrete evidence.

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The claim is made in the context of a country with a very poor and worsening human rights record. This suggests that there are significant issues that need addressing.

2. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: From a moral and ethical standpoint, prioritizing human rights is generally seen as a fundamental responsibility of any government. Ensuring the protection and promotion of human rights can lead to a more just and equitable society.

3. **Practical Implications**: Making human rights the highest item on the agenda could potentially lead to significant improvements in the quality of life for citizens, reduce abuses, and foster a more stable and peaceful society.

4. **Counterarguments**: There could be arguments that other issues (such as economic development, security, or healthcare) might also be seen as top priorities, especially if they are directly impacting the population's well-being. However, many of these issues are often intertwined with human rights.

Given these points, the claim that ""our top priority should be to make human rights the highest item on the agenda"" in a country with a poor human rights record is strongly supported by ethical considerations and the potential positive impact on society.

"Yüzde 2,9 büyüme demek, esasında vatandaş fakirleşiyor demek.",mostly true,tr,A 2.9% growth actually means that citizens are becoming poorer.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A 2.9% growth actually means that citizens are becoming poorer,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Type of Growth**: The claim does not specify what kind of growth is being referred to. Typically, growth rates are discussed in terms of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth. A 2.9% GDP growth generally indicates that the economy is expanding.

2. **Population Growth**: If the population is growing at a rate higher than 2.9%, then per capita GDP (which is a better measure of individual wealth) might not be increasing, and citizens could indeed be becoming poorer on average.

3. **Inflation**: If inflation is higher than 2.9%, the real purchasing power of citizens could be decreasing, meaning that despite nominal growth, people could be becoming poorer in real terms.

4. **Income Distribution**: Even with a 2.9% GDP growth, if the benefits of growth are not evenly distributed and are concentrated among the wealthy, the average citizen might not see an improvement in their economic situation.

Given these considerations, the claim is context-dependent. Without additional information about population growth, inflation, and income distribution, it is not accurate to definitively state that a 2.9% growth means citizens are becoming poorer.

2. The current position of the National Education budget after the party came to power.
3. Whether half of the national budget is indeed allocated to National Education.

Without specific data on the budget allocations before and after the party came to power, and the exact percentage of the current budget allocated to National Education, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is exaggerated or lacks precise data, it would likely fall under 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the typical budget allocations in most countries, it is highly unlikely that half of a national budget is allocated to education, as other sectors such as defense, healthcare, and infrastructure also require significant funding.

"Her sene 1,6-1,7 milyon Z kuşağından yeni seçmen devreye giriyor",mostly false,tr,"Every year, 1.6-1.7 million new voters from Generation Z are entering the electorate.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Every year, 1.6-1.7 million new voters from Generation Z are entering the electorate,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Definition of Generation Z**: Generation Z typically includes individuals born from the mid-to-late 1990s to the early 2010s. For the purpose of voting, we are interested in those turning 18 each year.

2. **Population Data**: According to U.S. Census data and other demographic sources, the number of individuals turning 18 each year can be estimated. The U.S. Census Bureau provides annual population estimates by age, which can be used to approximate the number of new 18-year-olds.

3. **Estimates and Projections**: Various demographic studies and projections suggest that the number of individuals turning 18 each year in the U.S. is around 4 million. However, not all of these individuals are from Generation Z, as the older end of Generation Z is already in their mid-20s.

Given that Generation Z spans a range of birth years, and considering the number of individuals turning 18 each year, the estimate of 1.6-1.7 million new voters from Generation Z entering the electorate annually seems plausible but may be slightly conservative. The actual number could be higher, especially in the earlier years when more of Generation Z is reaching voting age.

The OSCE is an international organization that addresses a wide range of security-related concerns, including conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict rehabilitation. It often issues statements and comments on events in its member states, including Armenia.

Historically, the OSCE has commented on various events in Armenia, such as elections, political developments, and conflicts. For example, the OSCE has monitored elections in Armenia and issued reports and statements regarding their conduct. Additionally, the OSCE Minsk Group has been involved in mediating the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which involves Armenia.

Azərbaycanın iqtisadiyyatı Cənubi Qafqazın ümumi iqtisadiyyatının 75 %-ni təşkil edir,half true,az,Azerbaijan's economy constitutes 75% of the total economy of the South Caucasus.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan's economy constitutes 75% of the total economy of the South Caucasus,"" we need to look at the GDP figures of the countries in the South Caucasus region, which includes Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia.

As of the most recent data available:

1. **Azerbaijan**: The GDP of Azerbaijan is significantly bolstered by its oil and gas sector. According to the World Bank, Azerbaijan's GDP was approximately $54 billion in 2021.
2. **Armenia**: Armenia's GDP was around $13 billion in 2021.
3. **Georgia**: Georgia's GDP was approximately $18 billion in 2021.

Adding these figures together gives a total GDP for the South Caucasus region of about $85 billion.

To find the percentage of the total economy that Azerbaijan constitutes:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Azerbaijan's GDP}}{\text{Total GDP of South Caucasus}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{54}{85} \right) \times 100 \approx 63.5\% \]

Based on these calculations, Azerbaijan's economy constitutes approximately 63.5% of the total economy of the South Caucasus, not 75%.

1. **Global Real Growth Rate (2002-2012)**:
   - According to data from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global real GDP growth rate averaged around 2.7% during this period. This figure is generally consistent with various economic reports and analyses.

2. **Growth Rate of Islamic Countries (2002-2012)**:
   - Islamic countries, often referred to as members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), include a diverse range of economies. Some of these countries experienced significant growth due to factors like high oil prices, economic reforms, and increased foreign investment.
   - According to various economic reports and analyses, the average growth rate for many Islamic countries during this period was indeed higher than the global average. Specific data from sources like the Islamic Development Bank and other economic research institutions suggest that the average growth rate for these countries was around 5.4%.

Türkiye 1980’den bu yana dünyanın en büyük 20 ekonomisinden biridir.,true,tr,Turkey has been one of the world's 20 largest economies since 1980.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey has been one of the world's 20 largest economies since 1980,"" we need to examine historical economic data and rankings.

Turkey's economy has indeed been significant on a global scale, but its position within the top 20 economies has fluctuated over the years. According to data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Turkey has often been close to or within the top 20 economies by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in nominal terms. However, it has not consistently held a position within the top 20 every single year since 1980.

Given this fluctuation, the claim is not entirely accurate but has a basis in truth.

Half of those who go to court lose, and the other half win ... Despite this, in 2016, satisfaction with the judiciary was 52.4%.

1. **Satisfaction Rates with the Judiciary**: The claim states that satisfaction rates with the judiciary being very high does not seem possible because half of those who go to court lose, and the other half win. This is a logical assertion, but it does not account for the fact that satisfaction with the judiciary can be influenced by factors other than winning or losing a case. For example, people might be satisfied with the fairness, efficiency, or professionalism of the judiciary, regardless of the outcome of their specific case.

2. **2016 Satisfaction Rate**: The claim states that in 2016, satisfaction with the judiciary was 52.4%. This is a specific statistic that can be verified with data from surveys or studies conducted in that year.

3. **Interpretation of the Figure**: The claim concludes that a satisfaction rate of 52.4% is a good figure. This is a subjective interpretation, but it can be considered reasonable if we compare it to satisfaction rates in other sectors or countries.

Given these points, the claim makes a logical assertion about the nature of satisfaction rates, provides a specific statistic for 2016, and offers a subjective interpretation of that statistic. The assertion about the nature of satisfaction rates is somewhat simplistic but not entirely false. The specific statistic can be verified, and the interpretation is subjective but reasonable.

1. **Literacy Rates**: According to various sources, Azerbaijan has a high literacy rate, often reported to be over 99%. This suggests that illiteracy is not a significant issue in the country.

2. **Education System**: While Azerbaijan has made significant strides in improving its education system, it is unlikely that all problems related to education have been completely resolved. Issues such as quality of education, access to education in rural areas, and educational infrastructure can still present challenges.

3. **Government Initiatives**: The Azerbaijani government has implemented various reforms and initiatives to improve the education sector, which have had positive impacts. However, like in many countries, ongoing efforts are required to address new and existing challenges.

Given these points, the claim that ""problems related to education have been resolved"" is an overstatement, even though significant progress has been made. The claim that ""illiteracy has been eradicated"" is more accurate but should be considered in the context of the high literacy rate rather than absolute eradication.

1. **Economic Indicators**: Turkey has faced significant economic challenges in recent years, including high inflation, currency depreciation, and a large current account deficit. These indicators suggest economic instability.

2. **Poverty Levels**: There has been an increase in poverty levels in Turkey, exacerbated by the economic downturn and the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising inflation has eroded purchasing power, making it harder for citizens to afford basic goods and services.

3. **Investment Climate**: Turkey has seen fluctuations in foreign direct investment (FDI). Political instability, economic volatility, and concerns over the rule of law have deterred some investors. However, the government has also taken steps to attract investment through various incentives.

Given these points, the claim that ""economic indicators are alarming, our citizens are becoming increasingly impoverished, and Turkey is lacking in investment"" has a basis in reality but may not fully capture the complexity of the situation.

1. **Introduction of 200 TL**: The 200 TL banknote was indeed introduced on January 1, 2009.
2. **Exchange Rate in 2009**: The exchange rate of 1.52 USD per TL in 2009 is accurate. Therefore, 200 TL could buy approximately 131 USD (200 TL * 1.52 USD/TL = 304 USD, but this seems to be a mistake in the claim; it should be 200 TL / 1.52 TL/USD ≈ 131.58 USD).
3. **Current Exchange Rate**: The current exchange rate of 7.16 USD per TL is accurate. Therefore, 200 TL can buy approximately 27.93 USD (200 TL / 7.16 TL/USD ≈ 27.93 USD).
4. **Value Loss**: The claim states that the Turkish Lira has never lost this much value before. This part of the claim is subjective and would require historical data analysis to confirm. However, the significant depreciation from 1.52 USD/TL to 7.16 USD/TL is indeed a substantial loss in value.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, the most recent comprehensive data on drug use in Turkey might not be readily available. However, previous reports and studies have indicated varying rates of drug use, often depending on the specific substance and demographic being studied.

Given the lack of specific, up-to-date data to confirm or refute the exact figure of 2.7%, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

1. Whether the BM Commission for Establishing Facts was indeed founded upon the claimant's proposal.
2. Whether the Gaza attacks were officially reported for the first time in history due to the efforts of this commission.

First, there is no widely recognized entity known as the ""BM Commission for Establishing Facts."" This raises doubts about the existence of such a commission and whether it was founded upon the claimant's proposal.

Second, the Gaza attacks have been reported by various international organizations, media outlets, and human rights groups for many years. The United Nations, for example, has had multiple reports and investigations concerning Gaza, including the Goldstone Report in 2009, which investigated the Gaza conflict.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the existence of the BM Commission and the historical record of Gaza attacks being reported by other entities, the claim appears to be unfounded.

1. **Gasoline Prices**:
   - According to recent data from global fuel price tracking websites, Turkey's gasoline prices are generally higher than many European countries. Countries like Russia, Belarus, and Moldova typically have lower gasoline prices due to subsidies and lower taxes.
   - However, Turkey's gasoline prices are not among the lowest in Europe. In fact, they are often higher due to significant taxes and import costs.

2. **Electricity Prices**:
   - For electricity prices, Turkey's rates are relatively low compared to many Western European countries. However, they are not the 3rd lowest in Europe. Countries like Ukraine, Georgia, and some Balkan states often have lower electricity prices.

Given this information, the claim that Turkey has the cheapest gasoline in Europe after Russia, Belarus, and Moldova is inaccurate. Additionally, the claim about electricity prices being the 3rd lowest is also not supported by current data.

1. **Molotov cocktails were already considered weapons**: This is generally true. Molotov cocktails, which are improvised incendiary devices, have long been classified as weapons in many jurisdictions due to their potential for causing harm and destruction.

2. **Penalties were already foreseen for those who demonstrated with their faces covered**: This also holds true in many places. Laws against wearing masks or covering one's face during demonstrations have been in place in various countries to prevent anonymity that could facilitate illegal activities.

3. **The Internal Security Reform is not new**: This part of the claim is more ambiguous and context-dependent. If the reform in question refers to a specific legislative change, it might be new in the sense of being recently enacted, even if it builds on pre-existing laws.

2. **Context**: The claim should be evaluated in the context of the specific country or region it refers to, as economic conditions and policies vary widely.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on general trends observed in a specific context, we can make an educated guess.

Given that salaries and pensions typically increase over time due to inflation, cost of living adjustments, and economic growth, it is plausible that both could have increased multiple times over 15 years. However, the exact figures (7 times for salaries and 9 times for pensions) seem unusually high without specific context or data to support them.

1. **National Council of Democratic Forces (NCDF)**: This is a coalition of opposition parties and groups in Azerbaijan. They have, in the past, called for election boycotts due to concerns over electoral fairness and government repression.

2. **Boycotts**: There have been instances where the NCDF and other opposition groups have called for boycotts of elections. For example, in the 2018 presidential election, the NCDF and other opposition groups boycotted the election, citing a lack of democratic conditions.

3. **Participation of the Azerbaijani People**: While the NCDF and other opposition groups may call for boycotts, it does not necessarily mean that the entire Azerbaijani population follows suit. Voter turnout can still be significant despite such calls, as not all citizens align with the opposition or choose to boycott.

Given this context, the claim that ""The Azerbaijani people boycotted the elections together with the National Council"" suggests a unified action by the entire population, which is not accurate. While the NCDF and some segments of the population may have boycotted, it is not representative of the entire Azerbaijani people.

1. **Turgut Özal's Tenure**: Turgut Özal served as Prime Minister of Turkey from 1983 to 1989 and as President from 1989 until his death in 1993. During his time in office, Turkey experienced significant economic reforms and liberalization.

2. **Per Capita Income in the Early 1990s**: According to World Bank data, Turkey's GDP per capita in current US dollars was approximately $2,500 in 1990.

3. **Per Capita Income in 2002**: By 2002, just before the AK Party (Justice and Development Party) came to power, Turkey's GDP per capita in current US dollars was around $3,500.

Based on this data, the claim that per capita income had fallen by 2002 compared to the early 1990s is not supported by the available economic figures. In fact, the per capita income appears to have increased during this period.

This involves checking reliable sources for the most recent data on the number of universities and the population of each country.

1. **Turkey**: According to the Council of Higher Education in Turkey, there are approximately 207 universities. With a population of around 84 million, this gives approximately 2.46 universities per 1 million people, which is close to the stated 2.2.

2. **USA**: The United States has over 4,000 degree-granting institutions. With a population of about 331 million, this results in approximately 12.08 universities per 1 million people.

3. **Denmark**: Denmark has around 8 universities. With a population of about 5.8 million, this results in approximately 1.38 universities per 1 million people.

4. **Malaysia**: Malaysia has around 20 public universities and numerous private institutions, totaling over 100. With a population of about 32 million, this results in approximately 3.13 universities per 1 million people.

5. **Poland**: Poland has around 400 higher education institutions. With a population of about 38 million, this results in approximately 10.53 universities per 1 million people.

6. **Switzerland**: Switzerland has around 12 universities. With a population of about 8.6 million, this results in approximately 1.4 universities per 1 million people.

7. **Norway**: Norway has around 10 universities. With a population of about 5.4 million, this results in approximately 1.85 universities per 1 million people.

Based on this data, the claim is not entirely accurate. While the number of universities per 1 million people in Turkey is close to 2.2, the number does not exceed 10 in Denmark, Malaysia, Switzerland, and Norway. It does exceed 10 in the USA and Poland.

Avrupa ve ABD’deki uygulamalarda hiçbir gösteride maske kullanılamaz. Maske kullanan alıp götürülecek,mostly true,tr,"In practices in Europe and the USA, masks cannot be used in any demonstration. Anyone using a mask will be taken away.","The claim that ""In practices in Europe and the USA, masks cannot be used in any demonstration. Anyone using a mask will be taken away"" is not entirely accurate. The regulations regarding the use of masks in demonstrations vary significantly between different countries and even within different states or regions in the USA and Europe.

In some places, there are laws or regulations that restrict the use of masks during demonstrations to prevent anonymity that could facilitate illegal activities. For example, in some U.S. states, there are anti-mask laws that were originally enacted to combat the Ku Klux Klan. However, these laws are not uniformly enforced and can vary widely. In Europe, some countries have similar laws, but again, enforcement and specifics can differ.

However, it is not universally true that masks cannot be used in any demonstration in Europe and the USA, nor is it universally true that anyone using a mask will be taken away. There are many demonstrations where masks are allowed, especially in contexts like the COVID-19 pandemic where masks are worn for health reasons.

Diaspor Komitəsi: “ABŞ Konqresi Azərbaycan ərazilərinin işğal faktını tanıdı”,false,az,"The Diaspora Committee: ""The US Congress recognized the fact of the occupation of Azerbaijani territories.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The US Congress recognized the fact of the occupation of Azerbaijani territories,"" we need to examine the historical and political context, as well as any official statements or resolutions made by the US Congress.

1. **Historical Context**: The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region has been ongoing for decades. The region is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but it has been controlled by ethnic Armenian forces since a war in the early 1990s.

2. **US Congress Actions**: The US Congress has passed various resolutions and statements regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, these resolutions often focus on calls for peace, humanitarian aid, and negotiations rather than explicitly recognizing the occupation of Azerbaijani territories.

3. **Specific Resolutions**: There is no widely recognized resolution or official statement from the US Congress that explicitly uses the term ""occupation"" to describe the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. The language used in congressional documents tends to be more diplomatic and less definitive in terms of labeling the situation as an occupation.

Given this context, the claim that ""The US Congress recognized the fact of the occupation of Azerbaijani territories"" appears to be an overstatement or misinterpretation of the nuanced and diplomatic language typically used by the US Congress.

Eğitim bütçesinin yaklaşık yüzde 90'ını zorunlu harcamalar oluşturmaktadır.,mostly true,tr,Approximately 90% of the education budget consists of mandatory expenditures.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Approximately 90% of the education budget consists of mandatory expenditures,"" we need to understand the composition of the education budget and the definitions of mandatory and discretionary spending.

Mandatory expenditures are those that are required by law, such as salaries for tenured teachers, pensions, and other contractual obligations. Discretionary expenditures, on the other hand, are those that can be adjusted or changed based on budgetary decisions, such as funding for new programs, supplies, and infrastructure improvements.

The exact percentage of mandatory expenditures in the education budget can vary significantly depending on the country, state, or local government in question. However, in many cases, a large portion of the education budget is indeed allocated to mandatory expenditures, primarily due to salaries and benefits for staff.

Without specific data for a particular region or country, it is challenging to definitively confirm the 90% figure. However, it is generally understood that a substantial portion of education budgets is dedicated to mandatory costs.

Given this context, the claim that ""Approximately 90% of the education budget consists of mandatory expenditures"" is likely an overestimation but not entirely implausible. Therefore, the most accurate classification would be:

The Turkic Council was established by the Republic of Turkey under the leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan"" is not entirely accurate.

The Cooperation Council of Turkic-Speaking States, commonly known as the Turkic Council, was established in 2009. While Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was indeed a significant political figure in Turkey at that time, the establishment of the Turkic Council was a collaborative effort involving multiple Turkic-speaking countries. The idea of closer cooperation among Turkic states predates Erdoğan's leadership and the AK Party's rise to power in 2002. 

Therefore, the claim overstates Erdoğan's and the AK Party's exclusive role in the creation of the Turkic Council and overlooks the broader context of regional cooperation efforts.

Türkiye OECD ülkeleri arasında işsizlik oranını en hızlı azaltan ülke olmuştur,half true,tr,Turkey has become the country that has reduced the unemployment rate the fastest among OECD countries.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey has become the country that has reduced the unemployment rate the fastest among OECD countries,"" we need to examine recent data and reports from credible sources such as the OECD itself.

1. **OECD Data**: The OECD regularly publishes data on unemployment rates for its member countries. This data includes both the current unemployment rates and the changes over time.

2. **Recent Trends**: We need to look at the most recent trends in unemployment rates across all OECD countries. This includes identifying which countries have seen the most significant reductions in their unemployment rates over a specific period.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: By comparing Turkey's unemployment rate reduction with that of other OECD countries, we can determine if Turkey indeed has the fastest reduction.

Without access to the most recent and specific data, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, based on general knowledge and trends up to 2023, Turkey has faced significant economic challenges, including high inflation and currency devaluation, which typically complicate efforts to reduce unemployment rapidly.

Given these considerations, and without specific data to confirm the claim, it is prudent to approach the statement with skepticism.

Dilgam Asgarov and Shahbaz Guliyev are Azerbaijani citizens who were detained by Armenian forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Their case has been a point of contention between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

To verify the claim, we would need to check PACE's official records, statements, and resolutions to see if there has been any mention or action taken regarding Asgarov and Guliyev's imprisonment.

If PACE has indeed not made any statements or taken any actions regarding their imprisonment, the claim would be 'True'. If PACE has made some statements or taken some actions, but not to a significant extent, the claim could be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If PACE has been actively involved or vocal about the issue, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

1. **Percentage of Retirees Aged 55 and Above**: The claim states that nearly 80% of retirees are aged 55 and above. This is a general statement and can vary by country and specific retirement policies. However, it is reasonable to assume that a significant majority of retirees are indeed in this age group.

2. **Average Life Expectancy in Retirement in Turkey**: The claim states that the average life expectancy in retirement in Turkey is 17.5 years. According to OECD data, Turkey does have a lower life expectancy in retirement compared to many other OECD countries. The exact figure can vary slightly depending on the source, but 17.5 years is within a plausible range.

3. **Average Life Expectancy in Retirement in France and Greece**: The claim states that the average life expectancy in retirement is 25 years in France and 24 years in Greece. According to OECD data, these figures are generally accurate, as both countries have higher life expectancies in retirement compared to Turkey.

Given that the figures provided for Turkey, France, and Greece are consistent with available data, and the general statement about the age of retirees is reasonable, the claim appears to be largely accurate.

Türkiye toplam hasta sayısına göre ölüm oranı bakımından da Avrupa’daki en iyi ülke konumundadır,half true,tr,Turkey is also the best country in Europe in terms of the death rate relative to the total number of patients.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey is also the best country in Europe in terms of the death rate relative to the total number of patients,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Current Data**: The claim requires up-to-date statistics on death rates relative to the total number of patients (case fatality rate) for all European countries.
2. **Comparative Analysis**: We need to compare Turkey's case fatality rate with those of other European countries.
3. **Reliable Sources**: The data should come from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), or national health departments.

Without access to the most current and comprehensive data, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on historical data and trends, Turkey has had varying case fatality rates over time, and other European countries have also had low rates at different points.

Given the complexity and the need for precise, up-to-date information, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted without specific data.

We never hear about the situation in Germany, but even the deaf sultan hears about it in Turkey.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the statistics provided and the assertion about media coverage.

1. **Statistics on Domestic Violence-Related Deaths:**
   - **Turkey:** According to various reports and organizations monitoring gender-based violence, the number of women killed due to domestic violence in Turkey can vary. For instance, the We Will Stop Femicide Platform reported that 300 women were killed in Turkey in 2020. However, the specific number of 170 women killed in a given year would need to be verified against reliable sources for that particular year.
   - **Germany:** Similarly, statistics on domestic violence-related deaths in Germany can be found through official crime reports and organizations. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) in Germany reported that in 2019, 117 women were killed by their partners or ex-partners. The number 303 seems significantly higher than reported figures and would need verification.

2. **Media Coverage:**
   - The claim that the situation in Germany is not covered by the media while it is widely reported in Turkey is subjective and harder to quantify. Media coverage can vary widely based on the source, region, and specific incidents. However, both countries have had significant media coverage on domestic violence issues, though the extent and nature of the coverage can differ.

Given the discrepancies in the numbers provided and the subjective nature of the media coverage claim, the statement cannot be fully verified as accurate.

"Şimdi, Türkiye, net ihracatçıdır tarımda, ithalatçı değildir.",false,tr,"Now, Turkey is a net exporter in agriculture, not an importer.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey is a net exporter in agriculture, not an importer,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on Turkey's agricultural trade balance.

A net exporter means that the country exports more agricultural products than it imports. Conversely, a net importer means that the country imports more agricultural products than it exports.

According to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) and other relevant sources, Turkey has historically been a significant exporter of various agricultural products, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains. The country has a diverse agricultural sector and benefits from favorable climatic conditions for a wide range of crops.

Recent trade data indicates that Turkey continues to export a substantial amount of agricultural products. For example, in 2021, Turkey's agricultural exports were valued at approximately $25 billion, while agricultural imports were valued at around $17 billion. This suggests that Turkey has a positive trade balance in agriculture, meaning it exports more than it imports.

Given this information, the claim that ""Turkey is a net exporter in agriculture, not an importer"" appears to be accurate.

This is nearly 15% of the total gross consumption of 229 billion kWh.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the calculations and the context provided.

1. **Energy Loss Calculation**:
   - The claim states an energy loss of 32 billion kWh.
   - Total gross consumption is 229 billion kWh.

2. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - The percentage of energy loss is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Loss} = \left( \frac{\text{Energy Loss}}{\text{Total Gross Consumption}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Loss} = \left( \frac{32 \text{ billion kWh}}{229 \text{ billion kWh}} \right) \times 100 \approx 13.97\%
     \]

3. **Comparison with the Claim**:
   - The claim states that the energy loss is ""nearly 15%"".
   - The calculated percentage is approximately 13.97%, which is close to 14%, but not quite 15%.

Given that the calculated percentage (13.97%) is close to the claimed ""nearly 15%"", but not exactly 15%, the claim is somewhat accurate but slightly overstated.

1. **Global Context**: In most countries, especially developed ones, doctors' salaries in 1996 were significantly higher than $6.5 per month. For instance, in the United States, doctors' salaries were in the range of thousands of dollars per month.

2. **Specific Contexts**: There might be specific contexts, such as in certain developing countries or during periods of extreme economic hardship, where salaries could be unusually low. However, even in such cases, a monthly salary of $6.5 seems implausibly low for a professional like a doctor.

Given the general economic conditions and the professional status of doctors, the claim that doctors' monthly salary was $6.5 in 1996 is highly unlikely to be accurate.

One commonly referenced source for such statistics is the International Labour Organization (ILO) or national labor statistics from countries like the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). According to the ILO's Global Employment Trends for Youth report, the percentage of young people (typically defined as ages 15-24) who are not in employment, education, or training (NEET) varies by country and region. For example, in some regions, the NEET rate can be as high as 30%, while in others, it may be significantly lower.

In the United States, the NEET rate for young people has been reported to be around 12-15% in recent years, according to the BLS. However, this rate can fluctuate based on economic conditions and other factors.

Given that the claim states ""27 out of 100 young people,"" which translates to a 27% NEET rate, this figure seems higher than the average NEET rates reported for many developed countries but could be plausible for certain regions or under specific circumstances.

Without more specific context or data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general range of NEET rates observed globally, the claim appears to be somewhat exaggerated for many contexts but not entirely implausible for others.

2. **Human Development Index (HDI)**: Developed countries usually score high on the HDI, which includes factors like life expectancy, education, and per capita income.
3. **International Recognition**: Developed countries are often recognized by international organizations such as the United Nations, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund.

1. The number of promissory notes protested for non-payment in 2002 was 500 thousand.
2. The current number of protested promissory notes has reached exactly 1 million.

Without access to specific data sources or databases that track the number of protested promissory notes over time, it is challenging to definitively verify these figures. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, we can analyze the statement as follows:

- The claim provides specific figures for two different years: 2002 and the present.
- It states that the number of protested promissory notes has doubled from 500 thousand to 1 million.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute these numbers, we can only assess the claim based on the information provided. If the numbers are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If there is any discrepancy in the figures, the claim would be 'False' or somewhere in between.

1. **6th in the world in attracting tourists**: According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) data, the top countries by international tourist arrivals typically include France, Spain, the United States, China, Italy, and Turkey. If the country in question is indeed Turkey, then it is often ranked around 6th in recent years.

1. **OECD Countries' Progress**: Historically, many OECD countries have seen a gradual decline in infant mortality rates over several decades. For instance, from the 1960s to the 1990s, many OECD countries reduced their infant mortality rates significantly due to improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions.

2. **Turkey's Progress**: Turkey has indeed made significant strides in reducing its infant mortality rate, particularly in the last few decades. According to data from the World Bank and other sources, Turkey's infant mortality rate has dropped dramatically from around 43 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to about 9 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2019. This represents a substantial improvement over a relatively short period.

3. **Comparison**: If we compare the rate of improvement, Turkey's reduction in infant mortality over approximately 10-20 years is quite rapid compared to the historical reductions seen in many OECD countries over a longer period (30 years or more).

Given this context, the claim that Turkey achieved in 10 years what OECD countries achieved in approximately 30 years is largely supported by the data, though it may slightly oversimplify the complexities and variations among different countries.

4. **Reports from Credible Sources**: What do organizations like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, or the United Nations say about the state of freedom of assembly in the country?

Without specific information about the country in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, given that ""completely ensured"" is a very strong statement implying no restrictions or violations whatsoever, it is generally difficult for any country to meet this standard perfectly.

Azərbaycan Xəzər dənizində ən böyük donanmaya malikdir,true,az,Azerbaijan has the largest fleet in the Caspian Sea.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan has the largest fleet in the Caspian Sea,"" we need to consider the naval capabilities and fleet sizes of the countries bordering the Caspian Sea, which include Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan.

1. **Russia**: Russia is known to have a significant naval presence in the Caspian Sea, with the Caspian Flotilla being one of the most powerful naval forces in the region. The flotilla includes various warships, missile boats, and support vessels.

2. **Iran**: Iran also maintains a considerable naval force in the Caspian Sea, with a number of warships and patrol boats.

3. **Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan**: Both countries have smaller naval forces compared to Russia and Iran, but they have been modernizing and expanding their fleets in recent years.

4. **Azerbaijan**: Azerbaijan has been investing in its naval capabilities, but its fleet is generally considered smaller than that of Russia and Iran.

Given this context, it is unlikely that Azerbaijan has the largest fleet in the Caspian Sea. The largest and most powerful fleet in the region is generally attributed to Russia, followed by Iran.

1. **Support Law for Farmers**: The claim states that there is a law requiring that less than 1% of the national income should not be allocated to farmers. This implies that at least 1% of the national income should be allocated to farmers.

2. **National Income**: The national income is stated to be around 4.5 trillion.

3. **Calculation of 1%**: 1% of 4.5 trillion is indeed 45 billion.

4. **Current Allocation**: The claim states that only 16 billion has been allocated so far.

5. **Shortfall**: The difference between 45 billion and 16 billion is 29 billion.

Based on these points, the claim seems to be logically consistent if the law indeed mandates that at least 1% of the national income should be allocated to farmers. However, the accuracy of the claim hinges on the existence and specifics of such a law.

Assuming the law exists as described, the claim would be accurate. If the law does not exist or has different stipulations, the claim would be inaccurate.

Without specific data to verify this claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, it is generally observed that NGOs and non-profit organizations have been expanding their reach and impact over the years due to increased funding, awareness, and technological advancements.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the fatal work injury rate in 2002 was approximately 4.0 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers. Recent data from the BLS indicates that the fatal work injury rate has decreased over the years, but it is not as low as 6 deaths per 100,000 workers. For example, in 2020, the rate was around 3.4 per 100,000 workers.

1. **Quantitative Progress**: This could refer to measurable factors such as enrollment numbers, graduation rates, exam scores, and other statistical data. If there is evidence showing an increase in these metrics, it would support the claim of quantitative progress.

2. **Qualitative Progress**: This could refer to aspects such as the quality of education, student satisfaction, critical thinking skills, and overall educational experience. Evidence for qualitative progress might include improvements in curriculum, teaching methods, student feedback, and external evaluations.

Without specific data or evidence to support or refute these aspects, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if there are reports or studies indicating improvements in both areas, the claim could be considered more accurate.

1. **Electoral Threshold in Turkey**: Turkey has had a high electoral threshold of 10% for parliamentary representation, which has been a subject of debate for many years.

2. **AK Party's Position**: The Justice and Development Party (AK Party) has been in power since 2002. There have been instances where the AK Party has suggested discussing the electoral threshold, but concrete initiatives to lower it have been limited.

3. **Other Parties' Positions**: Various opposition parties, including the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), have also called for lowering the threshold. These calls have been part of their broader political platforms and public statements.

4. **Legislative Actions**: While discussions have occurred, actual legislative initiatives to lower the threshold have been sparse. The AK Party has occasionally brought up the topic for discussion, but no significant legislative action has been taken by any party to lower the threshold.

Given this context, the claim that no party, including the AK Party, has taken any initiative to lower the electoral threshold, but only the AK Party has called for it to be discussed, is not entirely accurate. Other parties have also called for lowering the threshold, and the AK Party's actions have been more about discussing rather than initiating concrete changes.

Hükumetlerimiz döneminde 9 milyon yeni kişiye iş sağlayarak istihdam rakamını 29 milyona yükselttik,mostly false,tr,"During our governments' tenure, we provided jobs to 9 million new people, raising the employment figure to 29 million.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key pieces of information:

1. The initial employment figure before the government's tenure.
2. The final employment figure after the government's tenure.

The claim states that 9 million new jobs were provided, raising the employment figure to 29 million. This implies that the initial employment figure was 20 million (29 million - 9 million).

If both the initial and final employment figures are accurate and verifiable, and the increase in employment is indeed 9 million, then the claim would be 'True'. However, if there are discrepancies in these numbers or if the context of the employment figures is misleading (e.g., including part-time jobs, temporary jobs, or other factors not specified), the rating could change.

Without specific data to verify these numbers, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim. Assuming the numbers provided are accurate and there are no misleading factors, the claim appears to be logically consistent.

1. **Source of Data**: The claim should be based on reliable economic data, such as GDP figures from a credible institution (e.g., government statistics bureau, central bank, or reputable economic research organization).

2. **Time Frame**: The six-month period mentioned should be clearly defined. For instance, is it the first half of the year, the last six months, or any other specific six-month period?

3. **Context**: The term ""economy"" typically refers to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A decrease of 2.7% in GDP over six months is significant and should be contextualized within broader economic trends, such as recession, economic downturn, or specific events impacting the economy.

Without specific data to verify the claim, we can only assess its plausibility based on general economic knowledge. A 2.7% decrease in GDP over six months is a notable decline, but not unprecedented, especially during periods of economic stress.

"Erdoğan döneminde alınan dış borç, ödedim dediği IMF borcunu 12'ye katladı.",mostly true,tr,The foreign debt incurred during Erdoğan's term has multiplied the IMF debt he claimed to have paid off by 12 times.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The foreign debt incurred during Erdoğan's term has multiplied the IMF debt he claimed to have paid off by 12 times,"" we need to examine the relevant data on Turkey's foreign debt and the IMF debt repayment.

1. **IMF Debt Repayment**: During Erdoğan's tenure, Turkey did indeed repay its debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). By 2013, Turkey had repaid the last installment of its IMF debt, which was approximately $23.5 billion.

2. **Foreign Debt Increase**: To verify the claim, we need to look at the increase in Turkey's foreign debt during Erdoğan's term. According to various financial reports and data from the Turkish Statistical Institute and the World Bank, Turkey's gross external debt has increased significantly over the years. As of recent data, Turkey's gross external debt is around $450 billion.

3. **Comparison**: If we compare the $23.5 billion IMF debt to the current $450 billion foreign debt:
   - $450 billion / $23.5 billion ≈ 19.15

This calculation shows that the foreign debt has increased to approximately 19 times the amount of the IMF debt that was repaid, not 12 times.

The dependence of the Azerbaijani economy on oil prices has sharply decreased,mostly false,az,The dependence of the Azerbaijani economy on oil prices has sharply decreased.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The dependence of the Azerbaijani economy on oil prices has sharply decreased,"" we need to consider several factors, including recent economic data, diversification efforts, and the current structure of the Azerbaijani economy.

1. **Economic Data**: Historically, Azerbaijan's economy has been heavily reliant on oil and gas exports. According to the World Bank and other economic reports, oil and gas have constituted a significant portion of the country's GDP, government revenue, and export earnings.

2. **Diversification Efforts**: In recent years, the Azerbaijani government has made efforts to diversify its economy. Initiatives have been launched to develop sectors such as agriculture, tourism, information technology, and manufacturing. The success of these initiatives can be measured by the share of non-oil sectors in GDP and exports.

3. **Current Structure**: Despite diversification efforts, the oil and gas sector still plays a crucial role in the Azerbaijani economy. While there may have been some reduction in dependence, it is unlikely that this dependence has ""sharply decreased"" without significant structural changes and a substantial increase in the contribution of non-oil sectors.

Based on the available information, while there have been efforts to reduce dependence on oil prices, the claim that this dependence has ""sharply decreased"" seems to be an overstatement.

In terms of agricultural growth in GDP, we are first in Europe and seventh in the world,"" we need to consider several factors, including agricultural output, GDP contribution, and growth rates.

1. **Agricultural Output and GDP Contribution**: Turkey is indeed one of the leading countries in Europe in terms of agricultural output. According to various reports, Turkey has a significant agricultural sector that contributes notably to its GDP. However, being ""number one"" can be subjective and depends on the metrics used (e.g., total output, efficiency, growth rate).

2. **Agricultural Growth in GDP**: When it comes to growth rates, Turkey has shown substantial growth in its agricultural sector. However, specific rankings can vary year by year and depend on the data source. The claim that Turkey is ""first in Europe"" and ""seventh in the world"" in terms of agricultural growth in GDP would need to be verified against the latest data from credible sources like the World Bank, FAO, or other international agricultural reports.

Given the available information, Turkey is indeed a major player in European agriculture, but the exact rankings can fluctuate. Therefore, the claim has some basis in truth but may not be entirely accurate in its specifics.

1. **International Observers**: Reports from international organizations such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union (EU) often provide assessments of the electoral process. Historically, these organizations have raised concerns about the fairness and transparency of elections in Azerbaijan, citing issues such as voter intimidation, lack of media freedom, and irregularities in vote counting.

2. **Local Reports**: Independent local observers and opposition parties in Azerbaijan have also frequently reported irregularities and undemocratic practices during elections, including ballot stuffing, pressure on voters, and restrictions on opposition candidates.

3. **Freedom House and Other NGOs**: Organizations like Freedom House, which monitor the state of democracy and human rights globally, have consistently rated Azerbaijan as ""Not Free"" in terms of political rights and civil liberties. They have highlighted the lack of a level playing field for all political actors in the country.

Given this context, while Ilham Aliyev may claim that the elections were held in a democratic environment, substantial evidence from credible international and local sources suggests otherwise.

1. The claim states that the labor force participation rate of women was 31.6% in November 2015.
2. It also claims that this rate is less than half of the labor force participation rate of men.

First, let's verify the labor force participation rate of women in November 2015. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the labor force participation rate for women in November 2015 was approximately 56.7%, not 31.6%.

Next, we need to check the labor force participation rate of men in November 2015. The BLS data indicates that the labor force participation rate for men in November 2015 was around 69.1%.

Now, let's compare the two rates:
- The labor force participation rate for women was 56.7%.
- The labor force participation rate for men was 69.1%.

To see if the women's rate is less than half of the men's rate:
- Half of the men's rate (69.1%) is approximately 34.55%.

Since 56.7% (women's rate) is significantly higher than 34.55% (half of men's rate), the claim that the women's rate is less than half of the men's rate is incorrect.

2. **Comparison with Other Countries, Especially in Europe**: This part of the claim requires a comparative analysis. We need to check if the 31% increase indeed places the country ahead of many European countries in terms of renewable energy production growth.

Without specific data and sources, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the 31% increase is accurate and significant, and considering that many European countries are leaders in renewable energy, surpassing ""many countries, especially in Europe"" might be an overstatement unless the increase is exceptionally high.

Currency reserves typically include foreign exchange reserves, gold reserves, and other reserve assets held by a country's central bank. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.

For most countries, it is uncommon for currency reserves to exceed GDP. Currency reserves are usually a fraction of GDP, often held to manage exchange rates, pay for imports, and service international debt. However, there are exceptions, such as small, resource-rich countries or financial hubs with significant reserves relative to their GDP.

Without specific data for the country in question, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, based on general economic principles and typical global patterns, the claim is likely to be inaccurate for most countries.

1. **Historical Context**: The statement suggests that in the past, only 10% of people could get into university. This could be true for certain countries or regions during specific periods, especially when higher education was less accessible.

2. **Current Context**: The claim that ""now no one is left out"" implies universal access to university education. While access to higher education has significantly increased globally, it is not accurate to say that no one is left out. There are still barriers such as financial constraints, academic requirements, and socio-economic factors that prevent some individuals from attending university.

Given these considerations, the claim is an exaggeration of the current situation. While access to higher education has improved, it is not universally accessible to everyone.

"1939-2002 kümüle büyüme oranı %263,1’dir. Bu 64 yılın ortalama büyüme oranı ise 4,1’dir. AK Parti Hükümetlerinin kümüle büyüme oranı %54,6’dır, ortalaması ise 4,9’dur.",half true,tr,"The cumulative growth rate from 1939 to 2002 is 263.1%. The average growth rate over these 64 years is 4.1%. The cumulative growth rate of the AK Party Governments is 54.6%, with an average of 4.9%.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the provided growth rates and their calculations.

1. **Cumulative Growth Rate from 1939 to 2002:**
   - The claim states a cumulative growth rate of 263.1% over 64 years.
   - To find the average annual growth rate, we use the formula for compound annual growth rate (CAGR):
     \[
     \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of years.
   - If the cumulative growth rate is 263.1%, the ending value is 3.631 times the beginning value.
     \[
     \text{CAGR} = \left( 3.631 \right)^{\frac{1}{64}} - 1 \approx 0.0187 \text{ or } 1.87\%
     \]
   - The claim states an average growth rate of 4.1%, which is significantly higher than 1.87%.

2. **Cumulative Growth Rate of the AK Party Governments:**
   - The claim states a cumulative growth rate of 54.6% with an average of 4.9%.
   - Without the specific number of years, we can't directly verify this, but we can check the consistency.
   - Assuming the AK Party has been in power for a certain number of years, we can use the CAGR formula again:
     \[
     \text{CAGR} = \left( 1.546 \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1
     \]
   - For example, if \( n \) is 10 years:
     \[
     \text{CAGR} = \left( 1.546 \right)^{\frac{1}{10}} - 1 \approx 0.044 \text{ or } 4.4\%
     \]
   - The claim of 4.9% average growth rate seems plausible but slightly higher than the calculated 4.4%.

Given the significant discrepancy in the first part of the claim and the slight inconsistency in the second part, the overall claim is not accurate.

"Merkez Bankası her zaman, enflasyon yıl sonu tahminlerini açıklıyor. Ben bugüne kadar Merkez Bankası'nın açıklamış olduğu enflasyon oranını tutturduğunu görmedim.",half true,tr,The Central Bank always announces year-end inflation forecasts. I have never seen the Central Bank's announced inflation rate match the actual rate.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the nature of economic forecasts and the historical performance of the Central Bank's inflation predictions.

1. **Nature of Economic Forecasts**: Economic forecasts, including inflation forecasts, are inherently uncertain. They are based on models that use current and historical data to predict future outcomes. Various unforeseen factors, such as geopolitical events, natural disasters, or sudden economic shifts, can cause actual inflation rates to deviate from forecasts.

2. **Historical Performance**: If we look at the historical performance of Central Banks around the world, it is common for actual inflation rates to differ from forecasted rates. This is because economic conditions are dynamic and can change rapidly, making precise predictions challenging.

3. **Absolute Matching**: The claim states that the announced inflation rate has never matched the actual rate. Given the complexity and variability of economic factors, it is highly likely that exact matches are rare. However, forecasts can still be close to actual rates, even if not exact.

Based on these points, the claim that the Central Bank's announced inflation rate has never matched the actual rate is likely accurate in the sense that exact matches are rare. However, without specific historical data to confirm that there has never been a match, we can reasonably conclude that the claim is mostly true.

"Türkiye havacılıkta dünyada 11., Avrupa’da 5. sıraya yükseldi. THY Avrupa’nın 2. büyük şirketi haline geldi.",mostly true,tr,Turkey has risen to 11th place in the world and 5th place in Europe in aviation. Turkish Airlines has become the 2nd largest company in Europe.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific rankings and positions mentioned for Turkey and Turkish Airlines in the aviation sector.

1. **Turkey's Global and European Aviation Ranking:**
   - The claim states that Turkey is 11th in the world and 5th in Europe in aviation. This could refer to various metrics such as passenger traffic, number of flights, or overall aviation infrastructure. The most reliable sources for such data are organizations like the International Air Transport Association (IATA) or the Airports Council International (ACI).

2. **Turkish Airlines' Ranking in Europe:**
   - The claim states that Turkish Airlines is the 2nd largest company in Europe. This could be based on fleet size, number of destinations, passenger numbers, or revenue. Again, data from IATA or other aviation industry reports would be the most reliable sources.

Without access to the most recent and specific data from these authoritative sources, it's challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, based on general knowledge and recent trends in the aviation industry, Turkish Airlines has indeed been one of the leading airlines in Europe, often ranking highly in various categories.

Given the information available and the need for precise data to make a definitive judgment, the claim appears to be plausible but may not be entirely accurate in all aspects.

"2014 yılında kadın cinayeti sayısı 281, 2015'in ilk 6.5 ayında ise 160 oldu.",mostly true,tr,"In 2014, the number of femicides was 281, while in the first 6.5 months of 2015, it was 160.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the statistics provided for femicides in 2014 and the first 6.5 months of 2015. This involves checking reliable sources such as government reports, official crime statistics, or reputable organizations that track femicide data.

Without access to specific data sources or verification from credible reports, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume the data is sourced from a reliable entity, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific data verification in this context, the best approach is to consider the plausibility based on typical reporting and trends in femicide statistics.

Vətəndaş üçün ən əlverişli ipoteka kreditləri tətbiq edilir,half true,az,The most favorable mortgage loans for citizens are being implemented.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The most favorable mortgage loans for citizens are being implemented,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of ""most favorable""**: This is subjective and can vary based on interest rates, terms, accessibility, and other conditions.
2. **Current mortgage loan offerings**: We need to compare the current mortgage loans being offered to historical data or to those in other regions or countries.
3. **Implementation status**: Are these loans actually being implemented, or are they just proposed or in the planning stages?

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent improvements or favorable conditions in mortgage loans compared to previous offerings, we might lean towards a positive assessment. Conversely, if there is no substantial evidence or if the claim is overly broad, it might be less accurate.

Given the lack of specific data and the subjective nature of ""most favorable,"" the claim seems to be somewhat optimistic but not fully verifiable.

"2017 yılında dünyada 1 milyar 322 milyon kişi seyahat etti, Türkiye 2017'de en çok turist çeken ülkeler sıralamasında 6. sırada yer alıyor.",half true,tr,"In 2017, 1 billion 322 million people traveled worldwide, and Turkey ranked 6th among the countries that attracted the most tourists in 2017.","To verify the claim, we need to check two main points:

1. The total number of international travelers in 2017.
2. Turkey's ranking among the countries that attracted the most tourists in 2017.

According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the number of international tourist arrivals worldwide in 2017 was approximately 1.323 billion. This aligns closely with the claim of 1 billion 322 million people.

Regarding Turkey's ranking, the UNWTO reported that Turkey was the 8th most visited country in 2017, not the 6th.

Given this information, the claim is not entirely accurate.

12 yılda üreticilerimize 70 milyar lira nakit hibe desteği sağladık.,true,tr,"Over 12 years, we have provided 70 billion lira in cash grants to our producers.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Over 12 years, we have provided 70 billion lira in cash grants to our producers,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. The time period: Confirm that the period in question is indeed 12 years.
2. The amount: Verify that 70 billion lira has been provided in cash grants.
3. The recipients: Ensure that the grants were specifically given to producers.

Without access to specific financial records or authoritative sources that confirm these details, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a credible source and there is no immediate evidence to the contrary, we might lean towards a cautious assessment.

Given the lack of specific evidence to either fully confirm or refute the claim, the most balanced approach would be to consider it as ""Half True,"" acknowledging that while the claim could be accurate, it requires further verification.

There is no widespread evidence to support the claim that the salaries of doctors serving COVID patients have been increased by 3-5 times. While some regions or institutions may have provided bonuses, hazard pay, or other forms of financial incentives to healthcare workers during the pandemic, a general increase of 3-5 times in salaries is not a verified or common practice.",false,False,False
Hatırlayın 2002 öncesini. Zarar eden bir PTT... Bugün PTT Genel Müdürlüğümüz yılda 200 milyon lira civarında kar ediyor.,mostly false,tr,"Remember the time before 2002. A PTT that was making losses... Today, our PTT General Directorate is making a profit of around 200 million lira per year.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the PTT (Post and Telegraph Organization) was making losses before 2002.
2. Whether the PTT General Directorate is currently making a profit of around 200 million lira per year.

Without specific financial records or credible sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the information provided is accurate based on historical context and typical financial reporting, we can make an educated guess.

Historically, many state-run postal services worldwide have faced financial difficulties, and it is plausible that the PTT was making losses before 2002. Additionally, if recent reports or financial statements indicate that the PTT General Directorate is now making a profit of around 200 million lira per year, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact figures, the claim appears to be plausible but not fully verifiable with the information at hand.
