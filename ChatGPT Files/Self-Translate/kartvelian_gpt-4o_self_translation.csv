სახელმწიფო ბიუჯეტის ხარჯვით ნაწილს ლარის გაუფასურებაზე გავლენა არ ჰქონია,mostly false,ka,The expenditure part of the state budget has not had an impact on the depreciation of the lari.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The expenditure part of the state budget has not had an impact on the depreciation of the lari,"" we need to consider several economic factors and the relationship between government spending and currency depreciation.

1. **Government Spending and Currency Value**: Generally, increased government spending can lead to higher inflation if it is not matched by increased revenue. Higher inflation can, in turn, lead to the depreciation of the national currency. However, the impact of government spending on currency value can be influenced by various factors, including the overall economic environment, monetary policy, and external economic conditions.

2. **Specific Context of the Lari**: The Georgian lari (GEL) has experienced fluctuations due to multiple factors, including external economic shocks, trade balances, and investor sentiment. While government spending is one factor, it is not the sole determinant of currency value.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: To definitively assess the claim, one would need empirical data showing the correlation (or lack thereof) between state budget expenditures and the lari's depreciation over a specific period. If such data shows no significant correlation, the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if there is a significant correlation, the claim would be false.

Given the complexity and the need for specific empirical data, without concrete evidence, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general economic principles, it is unlikely that government spending has no impact at all on currency depreciation.

აჭარაში 25 ათასი ბათილი ბიულეტენი არ დაფიქსირებულა,false,ka,"No 25,000 invalid ballots were recorded in Adjara.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""No 25,000 invalid ballots were recorded in Adjara,"" we need to verify the specific data regarding the number of invalid ballots recorded in the Adjara region during the relevant election period.

1. **Check Official Election Reports**: Review the official election results and reports from the relevant electoral commission or authority overseeing the elections in Adjara.
2. **Cross-Reference with Credible Sources**: Look for credible news reports, statements from election observers, or other authoritative sources that provide information on the number of invalid ballots.
3. **Contextual Analysis**: Consider the context in which the claim was made, including any potential political motivations or disputes that might influence the reporting of invalid ballots.

Without access to specific data or reports, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is being made in response to allegations or rumors about a high number of invalid ballots, and if no credible evidence supports the existence of 25,000 invalid ballots, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, the most cautious and reasonable conclusion based on the information provided would be:

The claim suggests that there has been illegal, coordinated action against Rustavi 2 by both the judiciary and the public.

1. **Judiciary Involvement**: There have been multiple legal battles involving Rustavi 2, including ownership disputes that have reached the Georgian Supreme Court. Some observers and international organizations have raised concerns about the independence and impartiality of the judiciary in these cases. However, proving that the judiciary's actions were illegal and coordinated specifically against Rustavi 2 requires substantial evidence.

2. **Public Involvement**: The claim also mentions coordinated action by the public. This is more ambiguous, as ""the public"" can refer to various groups, including government supporters, activists, or general public sentiment. Coordinated illegal action by the public would be difficult to substantiate without clear evidence of organized efforts.

Given the complexity and the need for concrete evidence to support the claim of illegal and coordinated actions by both the judiciary and the public, the statement appears to be an interpretation that may not be fully substantiated by available facts.

1. **Historical Context**: Historically, the outcomes of court disputes between businesses and the state can vary widely depending on the legal system, the specific laws in question, and the time period. In some eras and jurisdictions, the state may have had a stronger position, while in others, businesses might have had more favorable outcomes.

2. **Empirical Data**: There is no widely accepted empirical data or comprehensive study that supports the claim that the state is favored 99% of the time in such disputes. Legal outcomes are influenced by a multitude of factors including the specifics of the case, the evidence presented, the legal arguments, and the judicial interpretation of the law.

3. **Legal Precedents**: Legal precedents show that both businesses and the state have won significant cases. For example, in the United States, there have been landmark cases where businesses have prevailed against state regulations, and vice versa.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to support the extremely high percentage (99%) and the variability in legal outcomes, the claim appears to be an exaggeration.

1. **Historical Context**: Salary increases for political officeholders are often subject to legislative or regulatory controls. These controls can vary by country, state, or municipality.
2. **Specific Regulations**: In many jurisdictions, salary increases for political officeholders are indeed restricted by laws or regulations to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure transparency and fairness.
3. **Verification**: Without specific details about the jurisdiction or the exact nature of the restrictions, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, it is generally true that many places have some form of restriction on salary increases for political officeholders.

Given the general nature of the claim and the common practice of restricting salary increases for political officeholders, the claim appears to be broadly accurate.

1. **Initial Number of Employed People**: 525 thousand
2. **Final Number of Employed People**: 480 thousand
3. **Time Period**: From October to April

The claim is straightforward and does not provide any additional context or data that might affect its interpretation. Based on the information given:

1. Whether the Ministry of Infrastructure is indeed unable to utilize 50% of its budget.
2. Whether the high-speed highway remains unutilized.

Without specific data or evidence to verify these points, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some level of truth but may be exaggerated or lacking context, we might consider it to be partially accurate.

1. **Technological Advancements**: There have been numerous technological innovations in agriculture, including precision farming, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and advanced irrigation techniques. These technologies have significantly increased crop yields and efficiency.

2. **Productivity Improvements**: Over the past few decades, agricultural productivity has increased substantially. This is evident in the higher yields per hectare and the ability to produce more food with fewer resources.

3. **Sustainability Practices**: There has been a growing emphasis on sustainable farming practices, such as organic farming, conservation tillage, and integrated pest management. These practices aim to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture while maintaining productivity.

4. **Global Food Security**: While there are still challenges in achieving global food security, significant progress has been made in reducing hunger and improving food distribution systems. However, issues like climate change, soil degradation, and water scarcity continue to pose challenges.

Considering these points, the claim that ""We have significant progress in agriculture"" is well-supported by evidence of technological advancements, productivity improvements, and efforts towards sustainability. However, it is also important to acknowledge ongoing challenges.

1. **Source of Research**: The claim should be backed by credible research or surveys that measure public trust in the police over a specific period.
2. **Historical Context**: The phrase ""for the first time in these years"" implies a specific timeframe. We need to know if there have been previous declines in trust within that period.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Trust in institutions like the police can fluctuate. It's important to verify if this is indeed the first recorded decline within the stated period.

Without specific data or a clear timeframe, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent and credible research, it might be partially accurate but lacking context.

1. **External Shocks**: These are unexpected events that affect the economy from outside, such as global financial crises, commodity price fluctuations, or geopolitical events.

2. **Government Actions**: To verify if the government indeed reduced the budget deficit in 2014, we would need to look at historical budget data and government statements or policies from that year.

3. **Mitigation of External Shocks**: If the government explicitly stated that reducing the budget deficit was a strategy to mitigate external shocks, this would support the claim.

Without specific historical data or government statements from 2014, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim.

2. **No water availability**: Despite the network, there is no water supply.
3. **Dug-up streets since 2015**: This suggests ongoing or incomplete construction work related to the network since 2015.

Without specific data or reports confirming these points, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on some level of observable reality, we might consider it as follows:

- If there is indeed a network but no water supply, and if the streets have been dug up since 2015, the claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If there are discrepancies in any of these points, the claim could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

2. The role of the exchange rate in this change.

Without specific data on the national debt percentages and the influence of the exchange rate, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, we can analyze the structure of the statement.

1. **National Debt Change**: The claim states that the national debt was approximately 37% and has increased to 44%. This is a specific numerical change that can be verified with historical and current national debt data.

2. **Role of Exchange Rate**: The claim attributes a significant role to the exchange rate in the change of national debt. This is a more complex assertion, as national debt can be influenced by various factors including government spending, economic growth, and fiscal policies, in addition to exchange rates.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute these points, we can only assess the plausibility based on general knowledge. Exchange rates can indeed impact national debt, especially if a country has significant foreign-denominated debt. However, without concrete evidence, we cannot definitively state the extent of this impact.

Based on the structure and typical factors influencing national debt, the claim seems to mix verifiable data (debt percentages) with a more speculative assertion (role of exchange rate).

If there was indeed an increase in healthcare funding in 2017 but poverty also increased, this part of the claim could be considered accurate. However, this requires specific data on healthcare funding and poverty rates for that year.

Second, the statement that ""citizens are facing healthcare challenges"" is more general and subjective. It could be true even if healthcare funding increased, as funding alone does not necessarily resolve all healthcare challenges.

However, if we assume the numbers provided are accurate and there is no additional context that changes the interpretation, the claim appears to be straightforward and specific.

If there is evidence that all villages have indeed had their irrigation water issues resolved, the claim would be 'True'. If most but not all villages have had their issues resolved, it would be 'Mostly True'. If the resolution is only partial or applies to a significant number but not the majority, it would be 'Half True'. If only a few villages have had their issues resolved, it would be 'Mostly False'. If there is no evidence of resolution or the issues persist widely, it would be 'False'.

Without specific evidence or data to confirm the status across all villages, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim.

In many legal systems, the right to a jury trial is a fundamental right for defendants in criminal cases. This right is often enshrined in the constitution or legal statutes. For example, in the United States, the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury in criminal prosecutions.

However, there are exceptions and nuances:
1. **Waiver of Jury Trial**: A defendant can waive their right to a jury trial, opting instead for a bench trial (trial by judge).
2. **Plea Bargains**: Many cases are resolved through plea bargains, where the defendant pleads guilty in exchange for a lesser charge or sentence, thus bypassing a jury trial.
3. **Certain Offenses**: Some minor offenses may not qualify for a jury trial and can be adjudicated by a judge alone.

The prosecutor does not have the authority to unilaterally deny a defendant's right to a jury trial if the defendant insists on it and it is within their legal right. The prosecutor can, however, influence the process through plea negotiations or by filing charges that may not require a jury trial.

Given this context, the claim that ""No matter how much the defendant wished for his case to be heard by a jury, the prosecutor always..."" implies that the prosecutor has the power to override the defendant's wish for a jury trial, which is not accurate.

2. **Regional Economic Growth Rates**: The South Caucasus region, which includes Armenia and Azerbaijan, has had varied growth rates. For example, Armenia had a growth rate of around 5.7% in 2021, and Azerbaijan had a growth rate of around 5.6% in the same year. These rates are generally lower than Georgia's.

3. **European Union Economic Growth Rates**: The European Union's average GDP growth rate in 2021 was around 5.3%. This is also lower than Georgia's growth rate for the same period.

1. **Economic Data**: We need to look at the economic data from 2012 to the present, including inflation rates, currency exchange rates, and changes in salaries and pensions.

2. **Inflation and Cost of Living**: Inflation can erode the purchasing power of income, meaning that even if nominal salaries or pensions have increased, the real value (adjusted for inflation) might be lower.

3. **Currency Exchange Rates**: If the claim is about income in dollars, we need to consider the exchange rate fluctuations between the local currency and the US dollar. A significant depreciation of the local currency against the dollar would result in lower income in dollar terms.

4. **Specific Data on Teachers and Pensioners**: We need specific data on the income trends for teachers and pensioners over the period in question.

Given that the claim is about a broad group (tens of thousands) and spans a decade, it is plausible that many teachers and pensioners could indeed have a lower income in dollar terms due to the factors mentioned above. However, without specific data, it is challenging to verify the exact number.

Based on general economic trends and the likelihood of such a scenario given inflation and currency fluctuations, the claim seems plausible but not definitively verifiable without more precise data.

Several international organizations and assessments evaluate judicial systems worldwide, including Transparency International, the World Justice Project, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). These organizations often report on issues of corruption within the judiciary.

For example:
1. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) often includes assessments of judicial corruption as part of its broader evaluation of corruption in various countries.
2. The World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index evaluates factors such as the absence of corruption in the judiciary.
3. Reports from the UNODC and other international bodies have also highlighted issues of judicial corruption in various countries.

This typically involves looking at reports from international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), or national statistical agencies.

Without specific data at hand, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can outline the steps you would take to verify it:

1. **Obtain FDI Data for 2012 and the Current Year**: Look up the volume of direct foreign investments for the year 2012 and the most recent year available.
2. **Compare the Figures**: Calculate the percentage change in FDI volume from 2012 to the current year.
3. **Determine if the Volume has Doubled**: Check if the FDI volume in the current year is at least twice the volume in 2012.

If the data shows that the FDI volume in the current year is indeed twice or more than the volume in 2012, the claim would be 'True'. If it is close but not quite double, it might be 'Mostly True'. If it is significantly less than double, the claim could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on how far off it is.

1. **Illegally Crossing the State Border**: This typically refers to entering a country without proper authorization or documentation, violating immigration laws.

2. **Two Different Regimes**: This phrase is ambiguous. It could refer to different legal or administrative processes, enforcement mechanisms, or treatment of individuals based on specific criteria (e.g., country of origin, method of entry, etc.).

In many countries, there are indeed different legal and administrative processes for handling individuals who cross borders illegally. For example, some countries may have different procedures for asylum seekers versus those who are simply undocumented immigrants. Additionally, the treatment and legal consequences can vary based on factors such as the individual's nationality, the manner of entry, and the specific laws of the country in question.

2. **Data Verification**: Without specific data or context about the government's actions in the private sector, it is impossible to verify the claim.

2. **Germany**: The official campaign period is not strictly defined, but campaigns usually intensify in the last few months before the election. The official pre-election period is generally considered to be around three months.

3. **France**: The official campaign period for presidential elections is about two weeks before the first round of voting. However, unofficial campaigning can start much earlier.

This happened without an increase in income...","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Since 2012, the number of cars in Tbilisi has increased 2.5 times. This happened without an increase in income,"" we need to verify two key points:

1. The increase in the number of cars in Tbilisi since 2012.
2. The trend in income levels in Tbilisi over the same period.

### Point 1: Increase in the Number of Cars
- According to various reports and data from the Georgian government and other sources, the number of cars in Tbilisi has indeed increased significantly since 2012. Some sources indicate that the number of cars has more than doubled, which aligns with the claim of a 2.5 times increase.

### Point 2: Income Levels
- To verify the claim about income levels, we need to look at economic data for Tbilisi or Georgia as a whole. If the data shows that income levels have remained stagnant or have not increased significantly, then the claim holds. However, if there has been a noticeable increase in income levels, the claim would be inaccurate.

### Analysis
- If we assume that the number of cars has indeed increased 2.5 times, we need to cross-check this with income data. If income levels have increased, even modestly, the claim would be misleading.

Given the complexity and the need for precise economic data, without specific figures on income trends, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general trends and available data, it is likely that there has been some increase in income levels, even if not proportional to the increase in car ownership.

In France, the penalties for personal use of cannabis are generally much less severe. 

As of recent updates, the law typically imposes a fine for personal use. For instance, a fixed fine of 200 euros can be issued for personal use of cannabis. The penalties can be more severe if there are aggravating circumstances, but they do not reach the extreme levels mentioned in the claim.

For example, the railway's net profit..."", we need to consider the following points:

1. **Economic Interdependence**: Sectors of the economy are often interdependent. A downturn in the overall economy can lead to reduced consumer spending, lower business investment, and decreased demand for goods and services, which can affect various sectors, including transportation like railways.

2. **Railway Sector Impact**: The railway sector can be particularly sensitive to economic conditions. In a poor economy, there may be less freight to transport due to reduced industrial activity, and fewer passengers traveling for business or leisure, which can negatively impact the railway's net profit.

3. **Historical Evidence**: Historical data often shows that during economic recessions, transportation sectors, including railways, typically experience declines in revenue and profit. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, many transportation companies, including railways, reported significant drops in profit.

Given these points, the claim that the poor state of the economy can negatively impact other sectors, such as the railway's net profit, is generally supported by economic principles and historical evidence.

This data is typically provided by national labor statistics agencies or international organizations like the International Labour Organization (ILO).

1. **Check the Source**: Verify the claim against reliable sources such as government labor statistics or reports from reputable organizations.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Understand the overall unemployment rate and the distribution of unemployment across different age groups.
3. **Recent Trends**: Consider recent trends in youth unemployment, which can be influenced by economic conditions, educational attainment, and other factors.

Without specific data at hand, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general knowledge, young people often face higher unemployment rates compared to older age groups due to factors like less work experience and higher rates of job turnover.

**Hypothetical Analysis**:
- If young people aged 20 to 29 make up a significant portion but not exactly half, the claim might be ""Mostly True"" or ""Half True.""
- If they make up significantly less than half, the claim would be ""Mostly False"" or ""False.""

**Example Data**:
- If data shows that young people aged 20 to 29 make up around 40-45% of the unemployed, the claim could be ""Mostly True.""
- If they make up around 25-35%, the claim could be ""Half True.""
- If they make up less than 25%, the claim would likely be ""Mostly False"" or ""False.""

However, if we assume that there is credible evidence indicating that there were indeed violations, the claim would be considered 'True'. Conversely, if there is no evidence or if the evidence suggests that the process was conducted properly, the claim would be 'False'.

2. **Context**: The context of the CEC's actions, including any official statements, reports, or investigations, would be crucial in determining the validity of the claim.
3. **Evidence**: Any documented evidence or lack thereof supporting or refuting the comments about the CEC's actions.

1. **Historical Context**: The occupation of Georgian territories by Russia has been a significant international issue since the Russo-Georgian War in 2008. Various U.S. administrations have addressed this issue in different forms, including statements, resolutions, and sanctions.

2. **Budget Law Specifics**: If the claim refers to a specific budget law signed by President Trump that explicitly mentions the occupation of Georgian territories, we need to check if this was the first time such a mention was included in a U.S. budget law.

3. **Previous Instances**: Prior to Trump's administration, there have been multiple instances where the U.S. government, including Congress, has addressed the occupation of Georgian territories. For example, the U.S. Congress has passed resolutions condemning the occupation and supporting Georgia's territorial integrity.

Given this context, it is unlikely that the signing of a budget law by Trump was the first instance when the occupation of Georgian territories was addressed by the U.S. government.

In 2011, there were no significant military conflicts or wars involving Georgia that would result in a defeat. The most notable conflict involving Georgia in recent history was the Russo-Georgian War, which occurred in August 2008. This conflict resulted in a military defeat for Georgia and led to the loss of control over the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which declared independence with Russian support.

Given that the statement refers to 2011 and there were no major conflicts or defeats for Georgia in that year, the claim that Georgia was defeated in 2011 is indeed a distortion of the facts.

2. **If the new constitution does not include any such provisions and instead either maintains or expands the president's powers, then the claim would be true.**

Without specific details about the new constitution in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim, it asserts that the new constitution does not restrict the president's powers at all.

Given the phrasing ""It is false that the new constitution in any way restricts the powers of the president,"" if there is any restriction, no matter how minor, the claim would be false.

1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** The GDP is a primary indicator of an economy's health. We need to compare Georgia's GDP in 2012 with its GDP in recent years.

2. **Inflation and Real GDP:** It's also important to consider inflation and real GDP growth, as nominal GDP might increase due to inflation without reflecting real economic growth.

3. **Economic Reports and Data Sources:** Reliable sources such as the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) or the World Bank provide historical and current economic data.

Based on available data:

- In 2012, Georgia's nominal GDP was approximately $424 billion.

1. **Legal Framework**: Italy is a signatory to international maritime laws, including the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR). These conventions obligate signatory countries to assist vessels in distress, regardless of the nationality or status of the people on board.

2. **Recent Policies**: In recent years, Italy has implemented stricter immigration policies, including measures to limit the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in migrant rescues. However, these policies do not equate to a blanket prohibition on assisting migrant ships in distress.

3. **Operational Reality**: Italian coast guard and navy have continued to conduct rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea. While there have been instances of delayed or complicated rescues due to political and bureaucratic hurdles, outright prohibition is not in place.

4. **Public Statements and Actions**: Italian officials have sometimes made statements suggesting a tough stance on immigration, but these do not translate into a legal prohibition against rescuing migrants at sea.

Given this context, the claim that Italy's rescue services are prohibited from assisting migrant ships that have sunk is not accurate.

1. Whether Georgia's economy has decreased in dollar terms.
2. Whether the economy was raised from 4 billion to 16 billion dollars.

First, let's look at the claim that Georgia's economy has decreased in dollar terms. This would require current data on Georgia's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in dollar terms. If recent data shows a decline in GDP compared to previous years, this part of the claim could be true.

Second, the claim that the economy was raised from 4 billion to 16 billion dollars needs historical GDP data. If historical records show that Georgia's GDP increased from 4 billion to 16 billion dollars over a certain period, this part of the claim could also be true.

1. **Georgian Lari (GEL):**
   - We need to check the exchange rate data for the Georgian lari over the past few months to see if it has indeed depreciated by up to 6%.

2. **Turkish Lira (TRY):**
   - Similarly, we need to check the exchange rate data for the Turkish lira over the past few months to see if it has depreciated by 25%.

Given that the claim specifies ""recent months,"" we should look at data from the last 3-6 months.

**Research Steps:**
- Check reliable financial news sources or currency exchange rate databases for historical data on GEL and TRY.
- Compare the exchange rates from the specified period to determine the percentage change.

**Example Data Sources:**
- XE.com
- OANDA
- Central banks' official websites
- Financial news websites like Bloomberg or Reuters

**Hypothetical Data Analysis:**
- If the Georgian lari (GEL) was 3.0 GEL/USD three months ago and is now 3.18 GEL/USD, the depreciation would be:
  \[
  \left( \frac{3.18 - 3.0}{3.0} \right) \times 100 \approx 6\%
  \]
- If the Turkish lira (TRY) was 8.0 TRY/USD three months ago and is now 10.0 TRY/USD, the depreciation would be:
  \[
  \left( \frac{10.0 - 8.0}{8.0} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
  \]

**Conclusion:**
- If the actual data matches these hypothetical calculations, the claim would be accurate.

**Verification:**
- Without access to real-time data, I cannot definitively verify the exact percentages. However, based on historical trends and recent economic reports, the Turkish lira has indeed experienced significant depreciation, often around the claimed 25%. The Georgian lari's depreciation of up to 6% is also plausible but less frequently reported.

1. **Base Salary**: According to publicly available information, the base salary of a parliamentarian in Georgia is indeed around 2,000 lari.

2. **Take-Home Pay**: The take-home pay of 1,600 lari suggests that there are deductions amounting to 400 lari. This could be due to taxes, social security contributions, or other mandatory deductions. This is a plausible scenario.

3. **Bonuses**: The claim mentions bonuses but does not provide specific details. It is known that parliamentarians in many countries, including Georgia, may receive additional compensation in the form of bonuses, allowances, or other benefits. However, without specific details on the bonuses, it is difficult to fully verify this part of the claim.

Given the information available, the claim about the salary and take-home pay appears to be accurate, but the statement about bonuses is vague and lacks detail.

რუსთავის მერს პრემია შვებულებაში ყოფნის დროსაც აქვს აღებული,true,ka,The mayor of Rustavi has received a bonus even while on vacation.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The mayor of Rustavi has received a bonus even while on vacation,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. Whether the mayor of Rustavi did indeed receive a bonus.
2. Whether the mayor was on vacation at the time the bonus was received.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm these details, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verified information, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the mayor did receive a bonus and was on vacation at the time, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the mayor received a bonus but was not on vacation, the claim would be 'False'.
- If there are some elements of truth but not all details are accurate, it could fall into 'Mostly True', 'Half True', or 'Mostly False' depending on the specifics.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I must refrain from making a final judgment without further information.

1. Whether agriculture in 2011 was indeed 20% less than in 2003.
2. Whether there is growth in agriculture today (the current year).

Without specific data on agricultural output or productivity for the years 2003, 2011, and the current year, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate, we can analyze the statement based on the given information.

The claim consists of two parts:
- ""In 2011, our agriculture was 20% less than in 2003.""
- ""Today, there is growth in agriculture.""

If both parts are accurate based on available data, the claim would be 'True'. If one part is accurate and the other is not, it would be 'Half True'. If neither part is accurate, it would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most cautious approach is to consider it 'Half True' because it is plausible that one part of the statement could be accurate while the other might not be.

1. **Secretary of the Security Council's Role**: The Secretary of the Security Council typically serves as an administrative and procedural officer. They are responsible for organizing meetings, preparing documents, and ensuring the smooth operation of the council's activities. They do not have the authority to make policy decisions or speak on behalf of the council unless explicitly authorized to do so.

2. **Speaking on Behalf of the Council**: Generally, the President of the Security Council, who rotates monthly among the member states, is the one who speaks on behalf of the council. The Secretary does not have the inherent right to speak for the council unless given specific permission.

3. **Speaking on Behalf of an Individual Member**: The Secretary of the Security Council does not have the authority to speak on behalf of any individual member of the council, including the President or any other member state representative.

Given these points, the claim that ""The Secretary of the Security Council does not have the right to speak on behalf of the council. Nor does he have the right to speak on my behalf"" aligns with the general understanding of the Secretary's role and limitations.

Everything is proceeding in accordance with the law.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts: the demand for Biblical Freedom certificates and whether everything is proceeding in accordance with the law.

1. **High Demand for Biblical Freedom Certificates**: This part of the claim would require specific data or evidence showing that there is indeed a high demand for such certificates. Without concrete data or a reliable source, it's difficult to verify this statement.

2. **Proceeding in Accordance with the Law**: This part of the claim suggests that the issuance and use of Biblical Freedom certificates are legally compliant. This would require an understanding of the relevant laws and regulations governing such certificates. Again, without specific legal context or evidence, it's challenging to confirm this.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context to verify both parts of the claim, it is difficult to fully substantiate it. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

სამუშაო ადგილები პანდემიამდე შემცირდა,true,ka,Jobs decreased before the pandemic.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Jobs decreased before the pandemic,"" we need to examine employment trends leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020.

In the years leading up to the pandemic, particularly from 2010 to 2019, the United States experienced a period of economic expansion and job growth. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the unemployment rate steadily decreased, and the number of jobs increased during this period. For example, the unemployment rate fell from around 9.6% in 2010 to 3.5% by the end of 2019, indicating a strong labor market with increasing employment.

Given this context, the claim that ""Jobs decreased before the pandemic"" does not align with the available data, which shows a trend of job growth rather than a decrease.

2. **Cement Dust and Cancer Link**: We need scientific evidence linking cement dust exposure to higher cancer rates.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: We need to compare cancer rates in Kaspi with other regions to see if Kaspi indeed has the highest number of cancer cases.

Without specific data and scientific studies to support the claim, it is difficult to definitively assess its accuracy. However, based on the general understanding that cement dust can be harmful and potentially carcinogenic, but without concrete evidence that Kaspi has the highest number of cancer cases due to this factor, the claim seems speculative.

Public officials, including those like Ana Natsvlishvili, often have the right to express their opinions on legislative decisions, especially if they hold positions that involve oversight, advisory, or advocacy roles. 

In many democratic systems, public officials are expected to provide their professional opinions and assessments on legislative actions. This is part of the checks and balances that ensure accountability and transparency in governance. Therefore, saying that a public official does not have the right to comment on parliamentary decisions is generally incorrect.

However, the term ""presumptuous"" is subjective and can be interpreted differently depending on the context and the speaker's perspective. It implies that the official is overstepping their bounds, but this is a matter of opinion rather than a factual statement.

Given this analysis, the claim that ""The public official [Ana Natsvlishvili] does not have the right and is being very presumptuous when she talks about the parliament making an irresponsible decision"" is not accurate in a general sense.

Kakha Bendukidze, a prominent Georgian businessman and politician, was involved in various reforms and privatization efforts in Georgia. In 2011, the Agricultural University of Georgia was indeed transferred to the Knowledge Fund, an organization founded by Bendukidze, for a symbolic price of 1 lari. This move was part of a broader strategy to reform and improve the educational system in Georgia.

However, the term ""gifted"" might be misleading. The transfer was part of a privatization effort aimed at revitalizing the institution, and Bendukidze's Knowledge Fund invested significantly in the university's development. The valuation of the property at 200 million lari is also a point of contention, as property valuations can vary based on different factors and assessments.

Given these nuances, the claim contains elements of truth but lacks context and may be somewhat misleading in its presentation.

2. **Comparative Data**: We need to compare the trust ratings of the banking system in question with those of other European countries. This would involve looking at recent surveys or reports from reputable sources such as the European Central Bank, World Bank, or independent financial research firms.

3. **Context and Specificity**: The claim is somewhat broad and lacks specific details about which country or banking system is being referred to. It also does not specify the time frame or the exact metrics used to determine the trust rating.

Without specific data or a clear reference to a particular study or survey, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some credible source or recent survey, it might hold some truth.

1. **Different Mechanism**: The President's fund, often referred to as a discretionary or contingency fund, is indeed a different mechanism compared to regular government funds. It is typically allocated for specific purposes at the discretion of the President.

2. **Auditability**: The claim that its audit cannot be conducted is more contentious. In many democratic countries, all public funds, including the President's fund, are subject to some form of oversight and audit, even if the process is less transparent or more restricted compared to other funds. The extent and nature of the audit might vary, but it is generally not accurate to say that it cannot be audited at all.

Given these points, the claim is misleading because it suggests a complete lack of auditability, which is not typically the case.

1. Whether the method of calculating the subsistence minimum remains unchanged.
2. Whether the subsistence minimum itself does not increase.

### Analysis:

1. **Method of Calculation**:
   - The method of calculating the subsistence minimum can vary by country and over time. Governments may update the methodology to reflect changes in economic conditions, cost of living, or policy objectives. Therefore, it is not universally true that the method of calculation never changes.

2. **Subsistence Minimum Increase**:
   - The subsistence minimum is typically adjusted periodically to account for inflation, changes in the cost of living, and other economic factors. It is common for the subsistence minimum to increase over time to ensure it remains adequate for basic living standards.

Given these points, the claim that the method of calculating the subsistence minimum does not change and the subsistence minimum does not increase is generally inaccurate. Both the method of calculation and the subsistence minimum itself are subject to change.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the claim is not accurate in most contexts.

1. **Geopolitical Context**: The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia has significantly disrupted trade routes, economic stability, and production capacities in both countries. This disruption generally leads to a decrease in exports rather than an increase.

2. **Economic Sanctions**: Many countries, including those in the European Union and the United States, have imposed economic sanctions on Russia. These sanctions often result in reduced trade capabilities and restrictions on exports.

3. **Trade Data**: If we look at recent trade data, it would likely show a decrease in exports from Ukraine and Russia due to the conflict and sanctions. However, there could be specific cases where certain goods are still being exported to neighboring countries like Georgia, but this would not be the general trend.

4. **Alternative Trade Routes**: Some countries might seek alternative trade routes or partners due to the conflict, but this does not necessarily mean an increase in exports to Georgia specifically.

Given these points, the claim that the ongoing events are ""further encouraging"" exports from Ukraine and Russia to Georgia seems to be an overstatement and not aligned with the broader economic and geopolitical impacts of the conflict.

According to the latest OECD data, countries like Denmark, France, and Belgium often rank at the top in terms of tax burden. The exact ranking can vary slightly depending on the year and the specific metrics used, but it is generally consistent.

1. **Monetary Policy and Currency Depreciation**: When a central bank issues loans to commercial banks, it increases the money supply. An increased money supply can lead to inflationary pressures, which might contribute to the depreciation of the currency. However, this is just one of many factors that can influence currency value.

2. **Other Influencing Factors**: Currency depreciation can be influenced by a variety of factors including trade balances, foreign investment flows, political stability, global economic conditions, and market perceptions. It is rarely caused by a single factor.

3. **Context-Specific Information**: Without specific data on the Georgian economy, the National Bank's policies, and other concurrent economic conditions, it is difficult to attribute the depreciation of the lari solely to the loans issued by the National Bank.

„წელს პირველად მოხდა ვიზიტორების კლება“,half true,ka,"""This year, for the first time, there was a decrease in visitors.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. Whether there was indeed a decrease in visitors this year.
2. Whether this is the first time such a decrease has occurred.

Without specific data or historical records of visitor numbers, it is impossible to definitively verify these points. However, if we assume the statement is based on accurate data and historical records, we can evaluate it as follows:

- If there was a decrease in visitors this year and it is confirmed to be the first time this has happened, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there was a decrease in visitors this year but it is not the first time this has happened, the claim would be 'Mostly False'.
- If there was no decrease in visitors this year, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to verify these points, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the statement and assuming it is based on accurate data, I would lean towards:

2. Whether no bonuses have been issued at all in the current year.

Without specific data or evidence to confirm or refute these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate information, we can analyze it as follows:

- The claim states a decrease in bonuses and supplements in 2016-2017, which is a specific and verifiable statement.
- The claim also states that no bonuses have been issued at all in the current year, which is another specific and verifiable statement.

Given that both parts of the claim are specific and can be verified, and assuming the information provided is accurate, the claim would be considered 'True'. However, without concrete evidence, we cannot definitively confirm this.

1. **Age Pension Increase**: The claim states that the age pension increased by 60%.

2. **Monthly Expenditure Increase**: The claim states that the monthly expenditure on pensions increased by 28.3%.

If the age pension increased by 60%, we would expect the total expenditure on pensions to increase by a similar percentage, assuming the number of pensioners remains constant. However, the claim states that the monthly expenditure increased by only 28.3%, which is significantly less than 60%.

This discrepancy suggests that either the number of pensioners decreased, or there are other factors at play that are not accounted for in the claim. Without additional context or data, it is difficult to fully reconcile these figures.

Given the significant difference between the 60% increase in the age pension and the 28.3% increase in monthly expenditure, the claim appears to be misleading.

   - If Georgian Post indeed turned a profit in 2017, the claim would be accurate.
   - If Georgian Post did not turn a profit in 2017, the claim would be inaccurate.

2. **Evaluating the Claim:**
   - The claim states that Georgian Post was profitable in 2017, which directly addresses the financial status for that specific year.

Based on available information, if Georgian Post did turn a profit in 2017, the claim would be 'True'. If there is any ambiguity or partial correctness, the rating might vary.

2. **Private Sector Salaries**: Salaries in the private sector also tend to increase over time, often at a faster rate than in the public sector. This is due to market competition, performance-based incentives, and other factors.

3. **Comparison**: Historically, private sector salaries have generally been higher than public sector salaries, especially for higher-skilled and higher-paying jobs. However, public sector jobs often offer other benefits such as job security, pensions, and healthcare, which can make the overall compensation package competitive.

2. **Trends**: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, child poverty rates can fluctuate year by year. Recent reports (as of 2023) indicate that there has been a general trend of decreasing child poverty rates in many parts of the United States, including Georgia, due to various factors such as economic recovery, policy interventions, and social programs.

3. **Verification**: For instance, the Annie E. Casey Foundation's Kids Count Data Book often provides detailed statistics on child poverty rates. If their latest reports show a decrease in child poverty rates in Georgia, this would support the claim.

4. **Context**: It's also important to consider the broader context, such as economic conditions, employment rates, and the impact of federal and state policies on poverty.

1. **Socially Vulnerable Individuals**: Social vulnerability can be influenced by various factors such as economic downturns, unemployment rates, natural disasters, and public health crises (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic). If recent data shows an increase in these factors, it would support the claim.

2. **Beneficiaries of Free Canteens**: The usage of free canteens typically rises when more people face economic hardship. Data from organizations that run free canteens, such as food banks and community kitchens, would provide insight into whether there has been an increase in the number of beneficiaries.

Without specific data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given the context of recent global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to increased unemployment and economic instability, it is reasonable to infer that both social vulnerability and the need for free canteens have likely increased.

3. **Contextual Factors**: Consider any recent events that might have caused a spike in unemployment, such as economic downturns, natural disasters, or significant layoffs in major industries.

Without specific data at hand, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to approach this:

- If recent data shows that the number of new unemployed people in Georgia is indeed close to 100,000, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the number is significantly lower or higher, the claim would be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on the discrepancy.

Second, regarding the constitutional limitation, the Constitution of Georgia does not explicitly mandate a specific percentage of the budget to be allocated to education and science. Instead, it generally emphasizes the importance of education and the state's responsibility to support it, but without specifying a fixed percentage.

1. **Wine exports have decreased**: This part of the claim can be verified by looking at recent data on wine export volumes and values. If the data shows a decline in wine exports, this part of the claim is true.

2. **Market diversification mitigated the negative impact**: This part of the claim suggests that although wine exports decreased, the situation would have been worse without market diversification. To assess this, we need to examine if there has been an effort to diversify markets and if this diversification has indeed helped cushion the decline. This could be supported by data showing that while some markets saw a decline, others either remained stable or grew, thereby reducing the overall negative impact.

If both components are supported by evidence, the claim can be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If only one component is supported, it might be 'Half True'. If neither component is supported, it would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the hypothetical nature of this scenario and without specific data, we can make a reasoned judgment based on the logical coherence of the claim.

**Reasoned Judgment**:
- It is plausible that wine exports have decreased due to various factors such as economic downturns, trade restrictions, or changes in consumer preferences.
- Market diversification is a common strategy to mitigate risks, and it is reasonable to assume that it could have lessened the negative impact of decreased exports.

Based on this reasoning, the claim appears logically sound and likely to be accurate.

Giorgi Kvirikashvili served as the Prime Minister of Georgia from December 30, 2015, to June 13, 2018. Before becoming Prime Minister, he held various ministerial positions, including Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development and Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, being a Prime Minister or a minister does not necessarily require being a member of Parliament.

If the claim is that Giorgi Kvirikashvili has never been in Parliament since the day of his approval as Prime Minister, we need to check if he was a member of Parliament during his tenure as Prime Minister or at any point after his approval.

Based on available information, Giorgi Kvirikashvili was not a member of the Georgian Parliament during his tenure as Prime Minister. He was appointed to his ministerial and prime ministerial roles without being a sitting member of Parliament.

"1.7 მილიარდზე მეტია სახელფასო ხარჯი, ამის 20%-ით შემცირება ნიშნავს პენსიის 50 ლარით გაზრდას",mostly false,ka,"The salary expense is over 1.7 billion, reducing it by 20% means increasing the pension by 50 lari.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the information provided and perform some calculations.

1. **Current Salary Expense**: 1.7 billion (assuming the currency is lari for consistency).
2. **Reduction by 20%**: 
   - 20% of 1.7 billion = 0.2 * 1,700,000,000 = 340,000,000 lari.

3. **Amount Saved**: 
   - After reducing the salary expense by 20%, the amount saved is 340,000,000 lari.

4. **Increase in Pension**: 
   - The claim states that this reduction would allow for an increase in the pension by 50 lari.

To verify this, we need to know the total number of pensioners. Let's denote the number of pensioners as \( P \).

5. **Total Increase in Pension Expense**:
   - If each pensioner receives an additional 50 lari, the total increase in pension expense would be \( 50 \times P \).

6. **Equating the Savings to the Increase**:
   - The savings from the salary reduction (340,000,000 lari) should equal the total increase in pension expense.
   - Therefore, \( 340,000,000 = 50 \times P \).

7. **Solving for \( P \)**:
   - \( P = \frac{340,000,000}{50} = 6,800,000 \).

This means that if there are 6.8 million pensioners, the claim would be accurate. 

To assess the truthfulness of the claim, we need to compare this number with the actual number of pensioners. If the actual number of pensioners is close to 6.8 million, the claim is accurate. If it is significantly different, the claim would be less accurate.

Without the exact number of pensioners, we can only make a general assessment. Given that 6.8 million is a very large number, it is likely that the actual number of pensioners is different, making the claim less accurate.

1. **Economic Indicators**: We need to look at GDP growth, poverty rates, and other economic indicators since Georgian Dream came to power.
2. **Unemployment Rates**: We need to check the unemployment rates over the years to see if there has been an increase.
3. **National Debt**: We need to review the national budget and debt levels to see if there has been a significant increase.

### Economic Indicators
- **GDP Growth**: According to various sources, Georgia has experienced fluctuating GDP growth rates. While there have been periods of growth, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the economy.
- **Poverty Rates**: The poverty rate in Georgia has seen some fluctuations. While there have been efforts to reduce poverty, the results have been mixed, and some reports suggest that poverty remains a significant issue.

### Unemployment Rates
- **Unemployment**: The unemployment rate in Georgia has been a persistent issue. While there have been efforts to create jobs, the unemployment rate has not seen a significant decrease and, in some periods, has increased.

### National Debt
- **Budget and Debt**: Georgia's national debt has increased over the years. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue, leading to higher borrowing and increased debt levels.

### Conclusion
- **Impoverishment**: The claim that Georgian Dream has impoverished the country is subjective and depends on various factors. While there have been economic challenges, it is not entirely clear that the country is more impoverished solely due to Georgian Dream's policies.
- **Unemployment**: There is evidence to suggest that unemployment remains a significant issue, and in some periods, it has increased.
- **Debt**: The national debt has indeed increased, particularly due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Given the mixed evidence, the claim contains elements of truth but also lacks context and nuance.

1. ""Foreign investments also have a downside; investors take away dividends.""
2. ""Today, if we see that in 2013...""

### Part 1: ""Foreign investments also have a downside; investors take away dividends.""
- **True Aspect**: Foreign investors often receive dividends from their investments in a country. This is a standard practice in equity investments where shareholders, including foreign ones, are entitled to a share of the profits.
- **Downside Aspect**: The statement suggests that this is a downside because the dividends are repatriated to the investors' home countries, which could be seen as a loss of capital for the host country. This can be considered a downside from the perspective of national economic retention.

### Part 2: ""Today, if we see that in 2013...""
- This part of the statement is incomplete and lacks context. It does not provide any specific information or data to evaluate. Without additional context or completion, it is not possible to assess the truthfulness of this part.

Without access to these specific records, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume that the information provided is based on reliable sources or official documentation, we can evaluate the claim as follows:

- The claim specifies exact amounts for operational expenses for vehicles (480,000 GEL) and representative expenses (up to 45,000 GEL).
- The use of ""up to"" for representative expenses suggests a maximum limit rather than an exact figure.

2. **Investments**: We need to look at the data on investments in the energy sector during his tenure. If there was a significant increase in investments, it would support the claim.

Without specific data or evidence, we can only make a general assessment based on the information provided. The claim suggests that investments are a good measure of Kaladze's success, which is a reasonable assertion if investments indeed increased significantly during his tenure.

According to the World Bank, the global extreme poverty rate has indeed seen a significant decline over the past few decades. In 1990, the global extreme poverty rate was around 36%, and by 2015, it had fallen to about 10%. This represents a substantial decrease, and in terms of the proportion of the global population, it has more than halved.

However, the absolute number of people living in poverty can be influenced by population growth. While the proportion has halved, the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty has also decreased, but not necessarily by half.

Given this context, the claim is mostly accurate but could be slightly misleading if interpreted strictly in terms of absolute numbers rather than proportions.

These regulations can vary depending on the country and its parliamentary rules.

1. **General Parliamentary Practice**: In many parliamentary systems, ministers are indeed required to appear before Parliament to answer questions, provide reports, and participate in discussions. This is part of their accountability to the legislative body.

2. **Specific Regulations**: The claim mentions ""the regulations,"" implying there are specific rules that mandate this obligation. Without knowing the exact regulations being referred to, it's challenging to definitively confirm the claim.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: If we assume the context is a typical parliamentary system where ministers are accountable to Parliament, the claim would generally be accurate. However, the specificity of ""a meeting with the faction"" might not be universally applicable, as it could depend on the internal rules of the Parliament or the political system in question.

However, the claim presents two distinct figures:
1. An increase in tourist flows by 16%.
2. An increase in the number of visitors by 124%.

These figures seem inconsistent with each other, as a 124% increase in the number of visitors is significantly higher than a 16% increase in tourist flows. This discrepancy suggests that the claim may be inaccurate or misleading.

The EU-Georgia Association Agreement, which includes a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), is a significant step towards closer integration. The EU has acknowledged Georgia's progress in implementing reforms, although it has also pointed out areas needing improvement.

2. **Council of Europe**: The Council of Europe has also recognized Georgia's efforts towards European integration, particularly in terms of democratic reforms, human rights, and the rule of law. However, it has also highlighted ongoing challenges and areas where further progress is needed.

3. **Other International Organizations**: Other organizations, such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and various non-governmental organizations, have similarly noted Georgia's commitment to European integration while also pointing out specific issues that require attention.

1. **National Movement Context**: The Indian National Movement primarily refers to the period of struggle for independence from British rule, which spanned from the late 19th century to 1947.

2. **Budget and Foreign Debt**: During this period, the British colonial administration controlled the budget and financial policies of India. The budget did see significant changes, but attributing a sixfold increase specifically to foreign debt requires precise historical financial data.

3. **Historical Financial Data**: Historical records indicate that the British colonial administration did increase spending in various sectors, including infrastructure and military, often funded by both domestic revenues and foreign loans. However, a sixfold increase directly attributed to foreign debt is a specific claim that would need corroboration from detailed financial records of the time.

Given the complexity and the need for precise historical financial data to confirm such a specific claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize the statement without further detailed evidence.

1. **Current Account Deficit Decrease to 8.7%**: This requires verifying the actual data on the current account deficit. If recent statistics or reports confirm that the current account deficit has indeed decreased to 8.7%, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Impact on Lari Exchange Rate Stability**: The relationship between the current account deficit and the stability of the lari exchange rate is generally accepted in economic theory. A lower current account deficit can contribute to a more stable exchange rate by reducing the need for foreign borrowing and increasing investor confidence. However, exchange rate stability is influenced by multiple factors, including foreign investment, inflation, and political stability.

Given that the claim involves both a specific statistic and a general economic principle, we need to ensure both parts are accurate.

Assuming the data on the current account deficit is correct and acknowledging the generally accepted economic principle, the claim appears to be well-founded.

1. **True**: This would mean that the economic growth was entirely artificial and had no positive impact on the general population.
2. **Mostly True**: This would mean that the economic growth was largely artificial and had minimal positive impact on the general population.
3. **Half True**: This would mean that the economic growth was partly artificial and partly real, with some segments of the population feeling the benefits while others did not.
4. **Mostly False**: This would mean that the economic growth was largely real and had a significant positive impact on the general population, but there were some areas where it was not felt.
5. **False**: This would mean that the economic growth was entirely real and positively impacted the general population.

Without specific data or context about the country in question, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we consider general scenarios where economic growth might not be felt by the population, such as growth driven by sectors that do not employ many people or growth that benefits only a small elite, we might lean towards a middle-ground assessment.

საქართველოში კორუფციის ერთ-ერთი ყველაზე დაბალი მაჩვენებელია და ამ მხრივ ბევრ ევროპულ სახელმწიფოსაც ვ...,mostly true,ka,"Georgia has one of the lowest levels of corruption and in this regard, it surpasses many European countries.","To evaluate the claim that ""Georgia has one of the lowest levels of corruption and in this regard, it surpasses many European countries,"" we can refer to recognized sources such as Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). The CPI ranks countries based on perceived levels of public sector corruption, with a higher score indicating lower corruption.

As of the latest available data, Georgia has made significant strides in reducing corruption and often ranks relatively well compared to many other countries. For instance, in the 2022 CPI, Georgia scored 56 out of 100, ranking 41st out of 180 countries. This score places Georgia ahead of several European countries, including some EU member states.

However, it is important to note that while Georgia performs well, it does not surpass all European countries. Many Western European countries, such as Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, consistently rank higher with significantly lower levels of perceived corruption.

Given this context, the claim that Georgia ""has one of the lowest levels of corruption"" is somewhat overstated, but it is accurate to say that it surpasses many European countries in this regard.

This was also the case during Shevardnadze's and Saakashvili's times,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Ranking**: Verify the current ranking of the country in question (presumably Georgia) in terms of the standard of living. This can be measured by various indices such as the Human Development Index (HDI), Quality of Life Index, or other similar metrics.

2. **Historical Rankings**: Check the historical rankings during the presidencies of Eduard Shevardnadze (1995-2003) and Mikheil Saakashvili (2004-2013). This involves looking at the same or similar indices for those periods.

3. **Consistency Across Time**: Determine if the ranking has remained consistent at 114th during these different time periods.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Ranking**: As of the latest available data, Georgia's ranking in terms of standard of living can be found in the Human Development Index (HDI) or other relevant indices. For instance, the HDI 2021 report places Georgia at 63rd out of 189 countries, which is significantly higher than 114th.

2. **Historical Rankings**: During Shevardnadze's and Saakashvili's times, Georgia's rankings in terms of standard of living varied. For example, in the early 2000s, Georgia's HDI ranking was lower than it is today, but it was not consistently at 114th. The country has seen improvements over the years, especially during Saakashvili's presidency, which focused on economic reforms and development.

3. **Consistency**: The claim that the ranking has remained at 114th during these different periods is not supported by the data. The rankings have fluctuated and generally improved over time.

### Conclusion:
Based on the available data, the claim that Georgia is currently ranked 114th in the world in terms of the standard of living and that this was also the case during Shevardnadze's and Saakashvili's times is not accurate.

1. **Identify the OSCE Report**: The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) produces various reports, including those on judicial reforms, election monitoring, and other governance issues. We need to identify the specific report being referenced.

2. **Evaluate the Report's Content**: Once the report is identified, we need to examine its findings on the selection of judges. The claim states that the progress in this area is evaluated ""very positively.""

3. **Cross-Reference the Claim**: Compare the claim with the actual statements and evaluations in the OSCE report. Look for sections that discuss the selection of judges and note the tone and content of the evaluation.

Without access to the specific OSCE report, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on a real and specific OSCE report, we can make an educated guess based on typical OSCE reporting practices.

OSCE reports are generally detailed and provide nuanced evaluations. They often highlight both positive developments and areas needing improvement. If the report indeed evaluates the progress in the selection of judges very positively, the claim would be accurate.

Given the structure of the claim and typical OSCE reporting practices, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is likely based on a positive evaluation but may not capture the full nuance of the report.

1. **Base Effect**: When a previous year's GDP growth is very low, the subsequent year's growth can appear higher due to the low base from which it is calculated. This is known as the base effect and can indeed make the current year's growth seem more significant.

2. **Contextual Data**: Without specific data on the GDP growth rates for the current and previous years, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, the statement does acknowledge a common economic phenomenon.

3. **Generalization**: The claim makes a broad generalization about GDP growth trends without providing specific figures or context. While the base effect is a valid concept, attributing the entire growth to this factor without additional context might be an oversimplification.

Given these considerations, the claim has some basis in economic principles but lacks specific data to fully substantiate it. Therefore, it is partially accurate but not entirely comprehensive.

Essential consumer goods typically include items such as food, household products, and personal care items.

1. **Inflation Data**: Recent inflation reports from various countries, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, often show that prices for essential goods have been rising. For example, food prices have seen significant increases in many regions due to supply chain disruptions, increased demand, and other economic factors.

2. **Supply Chain Issues**: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread supply chain disruptions, leading to shortages and increased costs for many essential goods.

3. **Energy Prices**: Rising energy costs can also contribute to higher prices for essential goods, as transportation and production costs increase.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is accurate based on current economic conditions and data.

This obligation is stipulated by the Association Agreement...,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Ministry of Environmental Protection should be a separate structure. This obligation is stipulated by the Association Agreement,"" we need to examine the specific provisions of the Association Agreement in question.

Association Agreements are typically international treaties between the European Union (EU) and non-EU countries that cover a wide range of areas, including political, economic, and environmental cooperation. These agreements often include commitments to align with EU standards and regulations, but they do not usually prescribe the exact administrative structures that a country must adopt.

1. **Association Agreement Content**: Association Agreements generally focus on aligning policies and regulations with EU standards rather than dictating the specific organizational structures of government ministries. They may require the establishment of certain regulatory bodies or frameworks but do not typically mandate the creation of specific ministries.

2. **Flexibility in Implementation**: Countries are usually given flexibility in how they implement the commitments made in the Association Agreement. This means that while a country may need to ensure effective environmental protection and regulatory compliance, it is not necessarily required to have a separate Ministry of Environmental Protection.

3. **Verification**: To verify this claim definitively, one would need to review the specific Association Agreement in question. However, based on the general nature of such agreements, it is unlikely that they would stipulate the exact organizational structure of government ministries.

Given this context, the claim that the Association Agreement obligates the creation of a separate Ministry of Environmental Protection is likely overstated.

1. **Historical Context**: Prior to 2013, many economies, especially in developing countries or those transitioning from centrally planned economies, saw significant roles played by the public sector. However, the trend in many parts of the world, including China and several other emerging markets, was a gradual shift towards greater private sector involvement.

2. **Economic Data**: In 2013, several countries experienced notable growth in their private sectors. For instance, in China, the private sector's contribution to GDP and employment had been increasing steadily over the years. By 2013, the private sector was indeed playing a more prominent role compared to previous years.

3. **Global Trends**: Globally, there was a trend towards privatization and deregulation, which allowed the private sector to take on a more significant role in the economy.

1. **Context**: In Spain, there have been numerous cases of evictions leading to public outcry and policy discussions. One notable case involved a woman named Amaia Egaña, who committed suicide in 2012 during an eviction in Barakaldo, which indeed sparked significant public and political reaction.

2. **Impact**: The suicide of Amaia Egaña led to widespread protests and increased pressure on the government to address the issue of evictions. This incident was a catalyst for the Spanish government to consider and implement changes in eviction laws and policies.

3. **Legislation**: Following the incident and subsequent public pressure, the Spanish government did introduce measures to provide more protection for vulnerable homeowners and tenants facing eviction.

1. The number of wine bottles exported in April this year: 19 million bottles.
2. The percentage increase compared to the same period last year: 180%.

Let's break it down:

- If the exports this April were 19 million bottles and this represents a 180% increase, we need to calculate the number of bottles exported last April.
- A 180% increase means the exports this year are 2.8 times the exports last year (since 100% + 180% = 280%, or 2.8 times).

Let \( x \) be the number of bottles exported last April. According to the claim:
\[ 19 \text{ million} = 2.8x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{19 \text{ million}}{2.8} \approx 6.79 \text{ million} \]

So, last April, approximately 6.79 million bottles were exported. 

To verify the claim:
- This April: 19 million bottles.
- Last April: approximately 6.79 million bottles.
- Increase: \( \frac{19 - 6.79}{6.79} \times 100 \approx 180\% \).

The calculations confirm that the increase is indeed around 180%.

1. **First Use of Artificial Snowmaking**: Artificial snowmaking was first used in the 1950s. Specifically, the first commercial snowmaking system was installed at Grossinger's Resort in New York in 1952.

2. **Extending the Season to 5 Months**: The impact of artificial snowmaking on extending the ski season can vary depending on the location and climate. While artificial snowmaking can significantly extend the ski season, the claim that it extended the season to exactly 5 months is more specific and may not universally apply to all ski resorts.

Given that artificial snowmaking was indeed first used in the 1950s but the specific claim about extending the season to 5 months is more variable and not universally documented, the claim is not entirely accurate but has some truth to it.

For the first part, the coverage of medications under universal healthcare varies by country. In some countries with universal healthcare systems, such as the UK (NHS) or Canada, medications are often covered to a significant extent, though there may be some out-of-pocket costs or specific exclusions. In other countries, the coverage might be less comprehensive. Therefore, the statement is not universally true.

For the second part, ""the prices of drugs are almost a third..."" is incomplete and lacks context. It could be referring to drug prices being a third of what they are in another country, or it could be referring to a reduction in prices. Without additional context, this part of the claim is ambiguous and cannot be accurately assessed.

1. ""The prices of medications have increased by 25%.""
2. ""Medications are one of the main drawbacks of healthcare.""

For the first part, the accuracy depends on the specific timeframe and context. Medication prices can vary widely based on the country, type of medication, and the period being referenced. If there is specific data or a study indicating a 25% increase in medication prices over a certain period, this part could be true. However, without specific data, it's challenging to verify this exact figure.

For the second part, it is generally accepted that the high cost of medications is a significant issue in healthcare systems around the world. Many reports and studies highlight the financial burden that medication costs place on patients and healthcare systems, making this statement broadly accurate.

Given the general acceptance of the second part and the potential variability in the first part, the overall claim can be considered as having a substantial basis in truth, though the exact figure of 25% may not be universally applicable.

2. **Georgia's defense needs 600 million, with 400 million...**: This part of the claim is incomplete, making it challenging to assess fully. However, we can look at Georgia's defense budget for context. According to recent data, Georgia's defense budget has been around $300-400 million annually. The claim that Georgia's defense needs 600 million might be an overestimation or could be referring to a specific project or future projection.

As of the latest available information, there have been significant efforts to improve water supply systems in Georgian cities, including Kutaisi. These efforts aim to provide more consistent and reliable access to water.

Given that the claim specifies a four-hour schedule, it suggests a very limited and specific timeframe for water availability, which may not accurately reflect the current situation if improvements have been made.

2. **Economic Size**: What is the total size of the economy in lari? 
3. **Calculation of Loss**: How is the 300 million lari loss calculated? Is it based on a comparison between the expected and actual economic output?

Let's break it down:

- If the economy was expected to grow by 3% but did not, we need to know the actual growth rate to calculate the difference.
- The total size of the economy (GDP) is crucial. For example, if the GDP is 10 billion lari, a 3% growth would be 300 million lari. If the actual growth was 0%, the loss would indeed be 300 million lari.
- If the actual growth was, say, 1%, the loss would be the difference between the expected 3% and the actual 1%, which would be 2% of the GDP.

Without specific numbers, we can only hypothesize. However, if the claim is based on a straightforward calculation where the expected growth was 3% and the actual growth was significantly lower, resulting in a 300 million lari shortfall, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific data but assuming the claim is based on a reasonable economic calculation, the statement seems plausible.

1. **Context of the Agreement**: Many countries that have agreements with the European Union, such as Association Agreements or Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs), often include provisions related to public health and taxation policies, including excise taxes on tobacco. These provisions are typically aimed at aligning the country's policies with EU standards, which often include measures to reduce tobacco consumption through higher taxes.

2. **Specifics of the Agreement**: If the agreement explicitly mentions the need for an annual increase in excise taxes on tobacco, then the claim would be accurate. If the agreement only suggests or recommends such measures without mandating them, the claim might be less accurate.

3. **Statements from Officials**: Giorgi Kakauridze, as a government official, might have access to the specifics of the agreement and its implementation. His statement would be based on the interpretation of the agreement's requirements.

Given that many agreements with the EU do include provisions for increasing excise taxes on tobacco to align with EU standards, and assuming Giorgi Kakauridze's statement is based on such an agreement, the claim appears to be accurate.

Be it media freedom...","To evaluate the claim that a country is ""far ahead in the post-Soviet space"" in terms of democratic standards and media freedom, we need to consider various metrics and comparisons with other post-Soviet states. 

1. **Democratic Standards**: 
   - **Freedom House**: This organization rates countries on political rights and civil liberties. Countries like the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) generally score higher in democratic standards compared to other post-Soviet states.
   - **The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index**: This index categorizes countries into full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes, and authoritarian regimes. Again, Baltic states tend to rank higher.

2. **Media Freedom**:
   - **Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom Index**: This index evaluates the level of freedom available to journalists. Baltic states typically rank higher in media freedom compared to other post-Soviet countries.

Given these points, if the country in question is one of the Baltic states, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. However, if the country is one of the Central Asian republics or Russia, the claim would likely be 'False' or 'Mostly False' due to lower rankings in democratic standards and media freedom.

Without specifying the country, the claim is too broad and can be misleading. Therefore, a balanced assessment would be:

1. Whether the White Bridge is indeed on the list of cultural heritage monuments.
2. Whether there is any documented evidence or credible sources indicating that the Kutaisi City Hall was unaware of this status.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm or refute the claim, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable source or statement from the Kutaisi City Hall, we can evaluate it accordingly.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I will base my response on the assumption that the claim is made in good faith and reflects a genuine lack of awareness by the Kutaisi City Hall.

This involves checking recent reports, government announcements, or credible sources that provide updates on gasification efforts in these areas.

If there is no ongoing gasification project or recent completion of such projects in Martvili, Tsalenjikha, and Chkhorotsku, the claim would be 'True'. If there are ongoing or recently completed gasification projects, the claim would be 'False'. If the situation is mixed or unclear, the claim might fall into one of the intermediate categories like 'Mostly True', 'Half True', or 'Mostly False'.

1. **Economic Data**: Economic growth is typically measured by GDP, which is composed of various sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, services, technology, and tourism. It is highly unlikely that tourism is the only sector experiencing growth, as economies are complex and multifaceted.

2. **Sector Performance**: Different sectors often grow at different rates. For instance, technology and healthcare are frequently cited as rapidly growing sectors in many economies. Additionally, sectors like renewable energy, e-commerce, and financial services have shown significant growth in recent years.

3. **Tourism Trends**: While tourism can be a significant contributor to economic growth, especially in countries with strong tourism industries, it is rarely the sole growing sector. The impact of tourism can also be highly variable, influenced by factors such as global travel trends, economic conditions, and geopolitical stability.

Given these points, the claim that tourism is the ""only"" growing sector is an overstatement and does not accurately reflect the complexity of economic growth across multiple sectors.

2. ""Interest rates have been reduced by three times.""

First, we need to verify if interest rates were indeed 21% during the previous administration. This would require historical data on interest rates from the relevant central bank or financial authority during that period.

Second, we need to understand what is meant by ""reduced by three times."" This could mean that the interest rate has been reduced in three separate instances, or it could imply that the interest rate has been divided by three.

Without specific historical data, it's challenging to verify the exact figures. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a significant reduction in interest rates over time, we can make an educated guess based on typical economic trends and central bank policies.

Given that interest rates of 21% are unusually high for most modern economies, and assuming that there have been significant reductions, the claim might be exaggerated but not entirely false.

1. Whether Nika Gilauri was indeed appointed as Ukraine's business ombudsman.
2. Whether the Georgian government sent a note regarding this appointment.

Nika Gilauri is a former Prime Minister of Georgia, and his involvement in various international roles could be plausible. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2021, there is no verified information that Nika Gilauri was appointed as Ukraine's business ombudsman. The position of Ukraine's business ombudsman has been held by other individuals, such as Algirdas Šemeta.

Additionally, there is no public record or widely reported incident of the Georgian government sending a note in relation to such an appointment.

Given the lack of evidence supporting both parts of the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is not accurate.

1. **Existence of the Book**: Salome Zourabichvili, the President of Georgia, has indeed authored books. Verification of the specific book in question is necessary.
2. **Context of The Hague**: The Hague is home to several international courts, including the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC). Russia and Georgia have had legal disputes in these courts.
3. **Use of Quotes**: We need to confirm if Russia has officially cited or used quotes from Zourabichvili's book in any legal arguments or documents submitted to these courts.

1. **Thresholds in Electoral Systems**: Many countries have electoral thresholds, which is the minimum percentage of votes a party needs to gain representation in the legislature. Common thresholds include 3%, 4%, 5%, and sometimes higher.

2. **Winner-Takes-All Systems**: In a ""winner-takes-all"" system, the candidate or party with the most votes wins all the representation for that district or area. This is common in single-member district systems like the United States' House of Representatives elections.

3. **Combination of Threshold and Winner-Takes-All**: The claim specifies a combination where there is a 5% threshold and the winner takes all the votes of those who did not surpass the threshold. This is a very specific and unusual combination. Typically, in proportional representation systems with thresholds, the votes of parties that do not meet the threshold are redistributed among the parties that did surpass the threshold, but not in a ""winner-takes-all"" manner.

Given the specificity of the claim and the nature of electoral systems, it is highly unlikely that such a system exists. Most electoral systems with thresholds do not combine them with a winner-takes-all approach for the votes of those who did not meet the threshold.

1. **Foreign Debt Impact**: Foreign debt can indeed impact a country's currency value. High levels of debt may lead to concerns about a country's ability to repay, which can reduce investor confidence and lead to currency depreciation.

2. **Historical Context**: If the previous government accumulated significant foreign debt, it could contribute to the depreciation of the lari. However, currency depreciation is typically influenced by multiple factors, including current economic policies, global market conditions, trade balances, and investor sentiment.

3. **Other Factors**: The lari's depreciation could also be influenced by other factors such as political instability, inflation rates, changes in foreign exchange reserves, and external economic shocks.

2. **Context of the Statement**: Understanding the context in which the statement was made can help clarify if there were any specific conditions or exceptions mentioned.

Assuming we have access to the historical budget data and it confirms that no previous year had an allocation of 2 billion GEL or more, then the claim would be accurate.

**Verification Steps**:
- Check the budget allocations for the ministry for the years prior to 2019.
- Confirm if any year had an allocation of 2 billion GEL or more.

If the data confirms that 2019 is indeed the first year with such a large allocation, then the claim is 'True'. If there were previous years with similar or larger allocations, the claim would be 'False'.

3. **Rosneft's Activities**: Rosneft, a major Russian oil company, has been involved in various activities in these regions. Compliance with Georgian law would mean not engaging in business activities in these territories without the consent of the Georgian government.

Given the geopolitical tensions and the fact that Russia recognizes these territories as independent while Georgia does not, the claim's accuracy can be contentious. If Rosneft is operating in these regions without Georgian consent, it would be violating Georgian law. However, if it is not engaging in such activities, it would be in compliance.

No matter what argument...""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""For more than 20 years, instead of developing, Georgia's economy has been experiencing stagnation,"" we need to examine the economic data and trends for Georgia over the past two decades.

1. **Economic Growth**: According to data from the World Bank and other economic sources, Georgia has experienced periods of significant economic growth, particularly after the Rose Revolution in 2003. The country implemented various economic reforms that led to substantial improvements in its business environment and economic performance.

2. **GDP Trends**: Georgia's GDP has generally been on an upward trajectory, with notable growth rates in several years. For example, the GDP growth rate was 12.3% in 2007, 6.4% in 2011, and 4.8% in 2019. However, there have been periods of economic challenges, such as the global financial crisis in 2008-2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which affected growth.

3. **Economic Reforms**: The country has made significant strides in improving its economic policies, reducing corruption, and attracting foreign investment. These efforts have contributed to economic development and modernization.

4. **Challenges**: Despite the progress, Georgia still faces economic challenges, including high unemployment rates, poverty, and regional disparities. These issues indicate that while there has been development, it has not been uniformly experienced across the entire population.

Based on this information, the claim that Georgia's economy has been experiencing stagnation for more than 20 years is not entirely accurate. There have been periods of growth and development, although challenges remain.

1. **Context**: If there has been a recent policy or economic change in Georgia that specifically targets soldiers' wages, this claim could be true or mostly true.
2. **Evidence**: We would need to look at official statements, news reports, or other reliable sources that confirm whether Georgian soldiers are experiencing wage reductions and if they are disproportionately affected compared to other groups.

Without specific evidence or context provided in the question, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, based on the phrasing, it suggests that Georgian soldiers are uniquely or primarily affected by wage reductions, which would require specific evidence to support.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

1. **Success of Pension Reform**: This is a subjective measure and can be evaluated based on various factors such as financial stability of the pension fund, satisfaction of the beneficiaries, and long-term sustainability. Without specific data or metrics, it's challenging to definitively assess the success.

2. **Reduction in Exit Requests**: This is a more quantifiable measure. If there is data showing a significant decrease in the number of requests to exit the pension scheme, this part of the claim can be verified.

Given that we do not have specific data or evidence provided in the claim, we cannot fully verify its accuracy. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some internal data or reports, we might consider it to be partially accurate.

1. **Source Verification**: Reliable and independent sources should confirm the claim. This includes reports from international organizations, human rights groups, or credible news agencies.
2. **Context and Evidence**: The context in which the claim is made and any available evidence supporting or refuting it should be examined.
3. **Historical and Political Context**: The relationship between South Ossetia and Georgia, including any recent tensions or conflicts, might influence the treatment of patients.

Without specific, verified information from credible sources, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general lack of widespread, verified reports confirming such mistreatment and accusations, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated.

Contactless patrolling systems, which often involve the use of technology such as drones, automated surveillance, and remote monitoring, have been increasingly adopted in various parts of the world, including Europe. Countries like the United Kingdom, France, and Germany have implemented various forms of contactless patrolling to enhance security and reduce the need for physical presence.

Given that there is evidence of such systems being used in Europe, the claim that ""The contactless patrolling system that we are introducing is a practice implemented in Europe"" can be considered accurate.

1. **Electricity Deficit**: This refers to the shortfall between electricity supply and demand. A ""very large"" deficit would imply a significant gap where demand consistently outstrips supply.

2. **Increasing Every Year**: This suggests a consistent annual trend of the deficit growing larger.

To evaluate this claim, we would need access to reliable data sources such as government reports, energy industry analyses, and historical records of electricity production and consumption for the specific region in question.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume a general context and consider global trends, many regions have been working towards balancing their electricity supply and demand through investments in renewable energy, grid improvements, and energy efficiency measures. Some regions may experience deficits due to rapid industrialization or population growth, but this is not universally true.

Given the lack of specific data and the variability across different regions, the claim cannot be universally applied.

It was allowed to do so due to an agreement made during the previous government.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main components:

1. **Arbitrary Increase in Gas Tariff**: The term ""arbitrarily"" suggests that the increase was done without any specific reason or justification. To verify this, we would need to examine the reasons provided by the company for the tariff increase. If the increase was based on factors such as rising costs, inflation, or regulatory changes, it would not be considered arbitrary.

2. **Agreement Made During the Previous Government**: This part of the claim suggests that the ability to increase the tariff was granted through an agreement made by the previous government. To verify this, we would need to look at the historical agreements or policies set by the previous administration that might have allowed for such increases.

Without specific evidence or detailed information on these two points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the company did have some form of agreement or policy from the previous government that allowed for tariff adjustments, but the term ""arbitrarily"" is not fully justified without further context, the claim might be partially accurate.

2. The amount of time the former governor spent on business trips during that tenure.

The claim states that the former governor's tenure was three and a half years, and during that time, he spent approximately a year on business trips. 

If the tenure was indeed three and a half years (which is 42 months), and the governor spent about a year (which is 12 months) on business trips, then the proportion of time spent on business trips would be approximately 12/42, which simplifies to about 28.6% of the time.

To classify the claim:
- 'True' would mean the statement is accurate without any significant discrepancies.
- 'Mostly True' would mean the statement is largely accurate but may have minor details that are slightly off.
- 'Half True' would mean the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context or details.
- 'Mostly False' would mean the statement contains some element of truth but is mostly inaccurate.
- 'False' would mean the statement is not accurate.

Given the information provided and assuming the numbers are correct, the claim seems to be largely accurate but might not be precise to the exact month. Therefore, it would be reasonable to classify it as 'Mostly True'.

1. **Verification of Data**: Check if there are reliable sources or official reports that confirm the reduction in tariffs and the corresponding savings of 150 million GEL.
2. **Context and Specificity**: Assess whether the claim provides enough context, such as which tariffs were reduced, the sectors affected, and the methodology used to calculate the savings.
3. **Time Frame**: Ensure that the time frame mentioned (3 years ago) aligns with the data available.

Without specific data or sources to verify the claim, it is challenging to determine its accuracy definitively. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some form of official report or credible analysis, we might consider it as 'Half True' because it suggests a significant saving but lacks detailed context and verification.

1. **Timeline of the 'Georgian Dream' Government**: The 'Georgian Dream' coalition came to power in Georgia in October 2012. Therefore, any hotels established from late 2012 onwards would fall under their rule.

2. **Hotel Establishment Data**: We would need data on the total number of hotels in Georgia and the number of hotels established before and after October 2012.

3. **Growth Trends**: Understanding the growth trends in the hospitality industry in Georgia during the relevant periods would help in assessing the claim.

Without specific data, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on available data and trends, we can make an educated guess.

Given the significant growth in tourism and hospitality in Georgia in recent years, it is plausible that a substantial number of hotels have been established since 2012. However, without concrete data, we cannot definitively say that it is ""almost half.""

1. **Historical Context**: There have been instances where tax cuts have coincided with economic growth. For example, the tax cuts during the Reagan administration in the 1980s are often cited as a period where the economy grew. However, the relationship between tax cuts and economic growth is complex and influenced by many factors, including monetary policy, global economic conditions, and government spending.

2. **Economic Theory**: According to supply-side economics, reducing taxes can stimulate economic growth by increasing disposable income for consumers and investment capital for businesses. However, this theory is debated among economists, and the outcomes can vary based on the specific economic environment and how the tax cuts are implemented.

3. **Budget Considerations**: While tax cuts can potentially stimulate economic growth, they can also lead to budget deficits if the reduction in tax revenue is not offset by cuts in government spending or increased revenue from economic growth. The impact on the budget depends on the balance between these factors.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat supported by historical examples and economic theory, but it is not universally true and depends on specific conditions and contexts.

2. Historical funding trends to assess whether psychiatry has indeed been underfunded for years.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information, we can make an educated guess.

1. **Historical Data**: GDP per capita is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people. Historically, GDP per capita tends to increase over time due to economic growth, technological advancements, and productivity improvements. However, this is not always the case, as there can be periods of economic recession or stagnation.

2. **Current Trends**: To verify the claim, we would need to look at the most recent data on GDP per capita. If the data shows a consistent increase over recent years without significant interruptions, the claim would be more accurate.

3. **Context**: The claim suggests that the increase in GDP per capita is a fact that is being overlooked. This implies that the trend is ongoing and significant enough to warrant attention.

Without specific data to reference, we can make a general assessment based on typical economic trends and the context provided. Generally, GDP per capita does tend to increase over time, but there can be exceptions due to economic downturns or other factors.

1. **Investments**: We need to check if there has been any significant change in domestic and foreign investments since the amendment.
2. **Trade**: We need to assess the overall trade volume, including imports and exports, to see if there has been any notable increase or decrease.
3. **Exports**: We need to verify if exports have indeed increased while other aspects of trade have not.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date economic data, we can make an educated guess.

Given the structure of the claim:
- It states that investments have not increased.
- It states that trade has not increased, except for exports.

If the data supports that investments and overall trade have remained stagnant or decreased, but exports have increased, the claim would be 'Mostly True'. If there are discrepancies or partial increases in investments or trade, it might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

**Hypothetical Data Analysis**:
- If investments remained the same or decreased: Supports the claim.
- If overall trade (including imports) remained the same or decreased: Supports the claim.
- If exports increased: Supports the claim.

These include reports from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Freedom House, Transparency International, and others.

2. **Approval of Reforms**: While Georgia has received positive feedback for certain reforms, particularly in areas like economic liberalization, ease of doing business, and anti-corruption measures, it has also faced criticism in other areas. For example, issues related to judicial independence, media freedom, and political pluralism have been points of concern in some international reports.

3. **Comprehensive Approval**: The claim suggests unanimous approval of all reforms and the government's course, which is a broad and absolute statement.

Out of 138 countries...,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgia's data in the Global Competitiveness Index improved by 7 positions out of 138 countries,"" we need to verify the specific rankings and changes in the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) for Georgia over the relevant years.

1. **Identify the relevant years**: We need to know the specific years being compared to see the change in ranking.
2. **Check the GCI reports**: The World Economic Forum publishes the Global Competitiveness Index annually. We need to look at the reports for the years in question to verify the rankings.

For example, if the claim refers to a change from one year to the next, we would compare the rankings in those specific years.

Assuming the claim refers to a recent improvement, let's hypothetically check the GCI reports for the years 2021 and 2022 (or the latest available years):

- **2021 GCI Report**: Suppose Georgia was ranked 74th.
- **2022 GCI Report**: Suppose Georgia was ranked 67th.

If these hypothetical rankings are accurate, then Georgia improved by 7 positions (from 74th to 67th).

However, without the exact years and specific data from the GCI reports, we cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the need for precise data verification:

1. **Global Peace Index (GPI)**: The GPI ranks countries based on their level of peacefulness. As of recent reports, Georgia has been improving its position but is not typically in the top tier of the safest countries.

2. **Numbeo Crime Index**: Numbeo provides a crowd-sourced global database of perceived crime rates. Georgia often ranks relatively low in crime, indicating a perception of safety among residents and visitors.

3. **World Economic Forum (WEF) Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report**: This report includes safety and security as one of its pillars. Georgia has been noted for its safety in this context, often ranking favorably compared to many other countries.

4. **U.S. Department of State Travel Advisories**: The U.S. Department of State provides travel advisories for countries around the world. Georgia is generally considered safe for travelers, with occasional advisories for specific regions.

Considering these sources, Georgia is often recognized for its safety, particularly in regional contexts and specific safety-related metrics. However, it may not consistently rank among the very top globally in all safety rankings.

1. **Budget Utilization Figure**: The claim states that the Ministry of Infrastructure's budget utilization in the first quarter is 107%. This means they have spent 7% more than their allocated budget for that period.

2. **Record Figure**: The claim also states that this 107% utilization is a record figure. This implies that no previous first-quarter budget utilization has been higher than 107%.

Without additional data or historical records of the Ministry of Infrastructure's budget utilization in previous years, it is challenging to verify the accuracy of the ""record figure"" part of the claim. However, assuming the provided information is accurate and there is no contradictory evidence, we can evaluate the claim based on the given data.

Given the information provided:

1. **Water Pricing Structure**: We need to verify the actual water rates charged to residents in both Telavi and Tbilisi. This information can typically be obtained from the local water utility companies or municipal authorities.

2. **Water Supply Schedule**: The claim states that Telavi residents receive water for only 2 hours daily, while Tbilisi residents have a 24-hour water supply. This needs to be confirmed through reliable sources such as local government reports or news articles.

3. **Cost Comparison**: Even if the water rates per unit are the same, the overall cost to residents could differ based on the amount of water they are able to use within the given supply schedule. If Telavi residents are paying more despite having limited access, it would imply a higher cost per unit of water or additional costs associated with limited supply.

Without specific data on the water rates and supply schedules, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate information regarding the pricing and supply schedules, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

2. **Time Frame**: The claim does not specify a time frame. Economic conditions can vary greatly over different periods, so it's important to know whether this refers to a recent event, a long-term trend, or a specific period of economic downturn.

3. **Uniformity**: The claim states ""every citizen,"" implying a uniform impact across the entire population. Economic changes typically affect different groups in different ways, so it's unlikely that every single citizen would experience the same level of economic decline.

The claim suggests that each pensioner receives 150 lari and loses approximately 12 lari per month. This implies a loss of 12 lari each month due to some factor, which could be inflation, cost of living increases, or other economic conditions.

If we assume the loss is consistent every month, the annual loss would be calculated as follows:
12 lari/month * 12 months/year = 144 lari/year.

Given this calculation, the statement ""which means, in a year..."" would be accurate if it concludes with a loss of 144 lari per year.

However, without additional context or verification of the exact figures and reasons for the loss, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim based on the provided information.

1. **Economic Growth Data**: We need to look at the GDP growth rates for the period starting from November 2013 through 2014.
2. **Consistency**: The claim specifies that the growth has been ""consistently high"" within the range of 7-8 percent.

Let's break it down:

- **November 2013 to December 2013**: We need to check if the growth rate for this period was within the 7-8 percent range.
- **2014**: We need to check the quarterly GDP growth rates for the entire year of 2014 to see if they consistently fall within the 7-8 percent range.

If the data shows that the growth rates for these periods were indeed within the specified range and consistently high, the claim would be true. If the growth rates were sometimes outside this range or not consistently high, the claim would be less accurate.

Without specific data at hand, I can provide a general assessment based on historical economic trends:

- **Historical Context**: Many emerging economies, including some in Asia, experienced high growth rates around this period, but exact figures can vary.

Given the need for precise data to make a definitive judgment, and assuming typical economic fluctuations, it is likely that while growth may have been high, it may not have been consistently within the 7-8 percent range every single quarter.

1. **Georgian Dream's Promise**: Verify if Georgian Dream indeed made such a promise during their first electoral campaign.
2. **Implementation and Results**: Assess whether Georgian Dream fulfilled this promise by providing housing for all displaced persons within their first electoral term.

### Step 1: Verification of the Promise
Georgian Dream, a political party in Georgia, has made various promises regarding social welfare and housing for displaced persons. It is essential to confirm if they explicitly promised to provide housing for all displaced persons within their first electoral term.

### Step 2: Evaluation of Fulfillment
If the promise was made, the next step is to evaluate the actual implementation. This involves looking at government reports, independent assessments, and credible sources to see if housing was indeed provided to all displaced persons within the specified timeframe.

### Analysis
- **Promise Verification**: If Georgian Dream did make such a promise, it would be documented in their campaign materials or public statements.
- **Fulfillment Check**: Reports from NGOs, government agencies, and international organizations would provide data on the housing situation for displaced persons during and after the first electoral term of Georgian Dream.

### Conclusion
Based on the available information, if Georgian Dream made the promise but did not fully achieve it, the claim would be rated accordingly.

**Example Scenario**:
- If Georgian Dream made the promise but only partially fulfilled it, the claim might be rated as ""Mostly False"" or ""Half True"" depending on the extent of fulfillment.
- If they did not make such a promise, the claim would be ""False.""
- If they made the promise and fully fulfilled it, the claim would be ""True.""

Given the complexity and the need for specific data, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where Georgian Dream made the promise but only partially fulfilled it by providing housing to a significant portion but not all displaced persons.

1. **Official Announcements**: If there has been an official announcement from a credible source (e.g., government, school district) stating that teachers' salaries will indeed increase by 17 percent, the claim would be 'True'.

Assuming the figures given in the claim are accurate and there are no additional contextual factors that would significantly alter the interpretation (such as changes in accounting practices, inflation adjustments, or reclassification of expenditures), the claim can be evaluated as follows:

- The claim compares two specific figures: 11 million in 2012 and 19 million today.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and it does result in a significant number of deaths annually in each state. The specific number of deaths attributed to tobacco use can vary slightly depending on the source and the year of the data.

For Georgia, the CDC's data and reports from the Georgia Department of Public Health indicate that the number of deaths due to tobacco-related diseases is indeed in the range of approximately 11,000 to 12,000 annually. This figure includes deaths from diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which are commonly associated with tobacco use.

If the World Bank introduced a new research methodology that significantly affected the indicators relevant to Georgia, it could plausibly explain a change in its ranking.

1. **IMF Reports and Assessments**: The IMF regularly publishes reports on the economic and fiscal status of its member countries, including Georgia. These reports often include evaluations of fiscal policies, economic reforms, and overall fiscal health.

2. **Georgia's Fiscal Reforms**: Georgia has been recognized for implementing significant economic and fiscal reforms, particularly in the early 2000s. These reforms have been aimed at improving tax collection, reducing corruption, and enhancing public financial management.

3. **IMF's View on Georgia**: The IMF has generally been positive about Georgia's fiscal reforms. For instance, in various reports, the IMF has acknowledged Georgia's progress in fiscal consolidation, economic growth, and structural reforms. However, the IMF also highlights areas needing improvement and potential risks.

- **Possible Sources:** Government financial statements, independent audits, news articles from reputable sources.

### Step 2: Verification of Decreasing Growth Rate in Agriculture

- If neither point is verified, the claim would be 'False.'
- If the evidence is mixed but leans towards inaccuracy, the claim would be 'Mostly False.'

2. The feasibility of relocating 50 thousand residents from the highlands of Adjara.

1. **Population of Khulo**: According to the most recent data, the population of Khulo Municipality in the Adjara region of Georgia is approximately 35-36 thousand people. This part of the claim is accurate.

2. **Relocating 50 thousand residents**: The claim suggests relocating 50 thousand residents from the highlands of Adjara, which implies that the highlands have at least that many residents. However, if the population of Khulo is only 35-36 thousand, it would be impossible to relocate 50 thousand residents solely from Khulo. The highlands of Adjara include other areas, but the claim specifically mentions Khulo, which makes the number seem exaggerated.

Given that the population of Khulo is correctly stated but the number of residents to be relocated is not feasible based on the population of Khulo alone, the claim is misleading.

1. **Currency Depreciation**: Currency depreciation occurs when the value of a currency falls relative to other currencies. This can be influenced by various factors including trade balances, inflation rates, interest rates, political stability, and overall economic performance.

2. **Imports and Currency Value**: When a country imports more goods and services, it needs to exchange its currency for foreign currencies to pay for these imports. This increased demand for foreign currencies can lead to a depreciation of the local currency. However, this is just one of many factors that can influence currency value.

3. **Other Factors**: While increased imports can contribute to currency depreciation, other factors such as changes in export levels, foreign investment flows, monetary policy, and global economic conditions also play significant roles.

Given that the claim attributes the depreciation solely to increased imports without considering other potential contributing factors, it oversimplifies the situation.

The region likely refers to the South Caucasus, which includes Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, or it could refer to a broader regional context such as Eastern Europe or the former Soviet states.

1. **Economic Forecasts**: Check the latest economic forecasts from reputable sources like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, or regional economic reports.
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the projected economic growth rates of Georgia with those of neighboring countries in the same region.

If the data shows that other countries in the region are also expected to experience economic growth, the claim would be inaccurate. Conversely, if Georgia is indeed the only country with a positive growth forecast, the claim would be accurate.

Given the complexity and variability of economic forecasts, it is essential to rely on the most recent and credible data available.

**Example Analysis** (Hypothetical Data):
- **Georgia**: Projected growth of 4%
- **Armenia**: Projected growth of 3%
- **Azerbaijan**: Projected growth of 2%

In this hypothetical scenario, the claim would be false because other countries in the region are also expected to grow.

**Example Analysis** (Hypothetical Data):

1. **Verification of the Amount**: Confirm whether 140 million is indeed the amount that remains unspent and has been carried over.
2. **Context of the Unspent Money**: Understand why the money remains unspent. There could be various reasons such as delays in project implementation, bureaucratic hurdles, or strategic financial planning.
3. **Implications of 'Unable to Spend'**: Assess whether the term ""unable to spend"" accurately reflects the situation. It could imply inefficiency, but it might also be due to planned savings or future allocations.

Without specific data or official statements from Tbilisi City Hall, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the amount is correct and the context suggests a mix of bureaucratic delays and strategic planning, the claim might be partially accurate but not entirely reflective of the situation.

1. **Administrative Costs**: Creating new factions typically involves some administrative work, such as reassigning office space, updating records, and possibly hiring additional staff. These activities could incur some costs, even if they are minimal.

2. **Operational Costs**: New factions might require resources for their operations, such as office supplies, communication tools, and other logistical support. These could also contribute to additional expenses.

3. **Budget Allocation**: If the parliament has a fixed budget for factions and the creation of new factions does not increase the overall budget but redistributes existing resources, then the claim might hold more weight.

4. **Historical Precedents**: Looking at past instances where new factions were created in the parliament could provide insight into whether additional expenses were incurred.

Given these considerations, it is unlikely that the creation of new factions would result in zero additional expenses. However, the extent of these expenses might be relatively small.

If we assume the context is the global economy or a major economy like the United States, we can refer to historical GDP growth rates. For the United States, the GDP growth rate data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) shows that the U.S. economy experienced fluctuations in growth rates around that period. However, there was no significant or sustained decline starting specifically in the summer of 2012. The U.S. economy had periods of slower growth, but it did not enter a consistent decline starting from that point.

For other major economies, such as the Eurozone, there were indeed economic challenges around 2012, including the Eurozone crisis, which could have led to a decline in GDP growth rates for some countries.

Given the lack of specificity and the variability depending on the region, the claim cannot be universally applied without more context. However, for the U.S. specifically, the claim would not hold true.

1. **Historical Context**: The Dream party, also known as the Georgian Dream, came to power in Georgia in 2012.
2. **Poverty Statistics**: According to data from the World Bank and other reputable sources, the poverty rate in Georgia before 2012 was not as high as 49%. For instance, the World Bank reported that the poverty rate in Georgia was around 32% in 2010.

1. **Time Frame**: The claim does not specify a time frame. The cost of living can vary significantly over different periods (e.g., year-over-year, decade-over-decade).

2. **Geographic Location**: The cost of living can vary greatly depending on the region or city. For example, urban areas may experience different rates of increase compared to rural areas.

3. **Components of Cost of Living**: Different components of the cost of living may increase at different rates. For example, housing costs may rise faster than food costs.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we consider general trends in recent years, many regions have experienced significant increases in housing costs, healthcare, and other living expenses, but a 40-50% increase across the board would be unusually high for a short period (e.g., a single year).

Given the lack of specific context and data, the claim seems to be an overgeneralization. Therefore, it is likely to be an exaggeration.

In many democratic systems, the president (or equivalent executive authority) has the power to veto legislation passed by the parliament. This veto power is a check and balance mechanism designed to prevent the passage of laws that the executive branch deems inappropriate or harmful. The veto does not dictate what must be included in the law; rather, it rejects the law in its current form. The parliament often has the option to override the veto with a supermajority vote, depending on the specific rules of the political system in question.

Given this context, the claim that a presidential veto is a ""gross interference in parliamentary activities"" is an exaggeration. The veto is a standard part of the legislative process in many systems and is intended to ensure that both branches of government have a say in the creation of laws.

The Mukhtarli case involves Azerbaijani journalist Afgan Mukhtarli, who was reportedly abducted in Tbilisi, Georgia, in May 2017 and later surfaced in Azerbaijani custody. The case has drawn significant international attention and criticism, with various human rights organizations and governments calling for thorough investigations.

If the claim is that ""whatever investigative steps needed to be taken from our side, those steps have been taken,"" it implies that the responsible authorities have completed all necessary investigative actions. To verify this, we would need to review official statements, reports from investigative bodies, and assessments from independent observers or human rights organizations.

Given the complexity and high-profile nature of the case, it is often challenging to ascertain whether all necessary steps have indeed been taken without comprehensive and transparent reporting. If there are credible reports or statements indicating that the investigation was thorough and complete, the claim could be considered accurate. However, if there are significant gaps, ongoing concerns, or criticisms about the investigation's thoroughness, the claim might be less accurate.

Without specific and detailed information confirming the thoroughness of the investigation, it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim.

1. **Living in the village**: The statement claims that it will no longer be possible to live in the village at all. This is a broad and absolute statement that would require substantial evidence to support. Factors such as availability of basic necessities, infrastructure, and community support would need to be considered.

2. **Family's income of 57 lari**: The statement mentions that the family's income is 57 lari. This is a specific figure that can be verified against the cost of living in the village. If 57 lari is significantly below the poverty line or insufficient to cover basic living expenses, it could support the claim that living in the village is not feasible.

Without additional context or data on the cost of living in the village and the specific needs of the family, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, given that 57 lari is a very low income, it is likely that living conditions would be extremely difficult.

**Assessment**:
- The claim about the impossibility of living in the village is an absolute statement that is hard to prove definitively without more context.

1. **EU Legislation on Public Procurement**: The European Union has specific directives that govern public procurement to ensure transparency, competition, and non-discrimination. These directives apply to various public sector entities, including public broadcasters.

2. **Exemptions and Special Provisions**: There are certain exemptions and special provisions within EU procurement laws that might apply to public broadcasters, particularly when it comes to content production and broadcasting rights. These exemptions are designed to allow public broadcasters to operate with some flexibility given the unique nature of their services.

3. **Recent Changes or Reforms**: If there have been recent legislative changes or reforms that specifically exclude a significant portion of public broadcaster procurements from EU procurement rules, this would need to be verified through official EU legislative documents or credible sources.

2. **Role of Ivanishvili**: Bidzina Ivanishvili became the Prime Minister of Georgia in October 2012. His government made several changes to various programs, including educational initiatives.

3. **Closure of the Program**: Reports indicate that the TLG program was significantly scaled back after Ivanishvili's government came to power, but it was not entirely closed. The number of participating teachers decreased, and the program's scope was reduced.

4. **Number of Americans**: The claim that ""nearly 3,000 Americans used to come to Georgia"" seems to be an exaggeration.

1. ""Cartu Bank does not issue mortgage loans"" - This part of the statement suggests that, as a general rule, Cartu Bank does not provide mortgage loans to the public or typical customers.

2. ""but as an exception, it issues mortgage loans to the government"" - This part indicates that there is a specific exception to the general rule, where the bank does provide mortgage loans, but only to the government.

If both parts of the statement are accurate, then the claim would be 'True'. If only one part is accurate or if there are significant nuances, the claim might fall into one of the other categories.

უკრაინაში მართლმადიდებელ ეკლესიას არბევენ,false,ka,'The Orthodox Church is being raided in Ukraine.',"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Orthodox Church is being raided in Ukraine,"" we need to consider the context and recent events.

1. **Context**: The Orthodox Church in Ukraine is divided primarily into two main branches: the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU). The UOC has historically been aligned with the Moscow Patriarchate, while the OCU is recognized as independent by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.

2. **Recent Events**: There have been reports of Ukrainian authorities conducting searches and raids on properties associated with the UOC, particularly those linked to the Moscow Patriarchate. These actions are often justified by the Ukrainian government as efforts to counter pro-Russian activities and ensure national security, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict with Russia.

3. **Verification**: Multiple credible news sources, including international media and local Ukrainian reports, have documented these raids. The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) has confirmed conducting operations targeting individuals and institutions suspected of collaborating with Russian forces or spreading pro-Russian propaganda.

Given this information, the claim that ""The Orthodox Church is being raided in Ukraine"" is based on verifiable events, though it is important to note that these raids are specifically targeting the UOC associated with the Moscow Patriarchate, not the entire Orthodox Church in Ukraine.

1. **Hryvnia (Ukraine)**: The stability of the hryvnia can be influenced by various factors including economic policies, geopolitical events, and international aid. As of the latest data, if the hryvnia has shown signs of stabilization, it would be reflected in a relatively stable exchange rate over a recent period.

2. **Ruble (Russia)**: The ruble's stability is also subject to economic sanctions, oil prices, and domestic economic policies. If recent data shows that the ruble has maintained a stable exchange rate, this part of the claim would be accurate.

3. **Lari (Georgia)**: The lari's exchange rate can be affected by economic conditions, political stability, and external economic factors. If the lari has been depreciating consistently, this part of the claim would be true.

Given the complexity and the need for up-to-date financial data, the accuracy of the claim can be assessed by looking at recent exchange rate trends from reliable financial sources such as central banks, financial news, and economic reports.

Based on the latest available data (as of 2023):
- The hryvnia has shown some signs of stabilization due to international support and economic measures.
- The ruble has experienced fluctuations but has shown periods of relative stability.
- The lari has faced depreciation pressures due to various economic challenges.

Therefore, the claim appears to be generally accurate but may not fully capture the nuances of each currency's situation.

1. **Salary Range**: The claim states that the salary is between 14,000 and 16,000 lari. This can be verified by checking the official salary scales or reports from the regulatory commissions.

2. **Upper Limit**: The claim also states that the upper limit is not defined. This implies that there is no cap on the maximum salary that can be earned.

Without specific data from the regulatory commissions, it is challenging to confirm the exact salary range and the presence or absence of an upper limit. However, if we assume the claim is based on available information, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the information provided and the need for verification from official sources, the claim appears to be somewhat accurate but lacks complete verification.

1. **Worsening Situation in the Energy Sector**:
   - The energy sector can face various challenges such as fluctuating oil prices, regulatory changes, geopolitical tensions, and shifts towards renewable energy.
   - Recent years have seen significant disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected demand and supply chains.
   - However, the situation can vary by region and specific energy sources (e.g., fossil fuels vs. renewables).

2. **Decreasing Investments**:
   - Investment trends in the energy sector can be influenced by market conditions, government policies, and technological advancements.
   - There has been a notable shift towards renewable energy investments, while traditional fossil fuel investments may have seen declines.
   - Reports from organizations like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other industry analyses can provide insights into these trends.

Given the complexity and variability in the energy sector, the claim may hold true in certain contexts but not universally. For instance, while investments in fossil fuels might be decreasing, investments in renewable energy are often increasing.

**Conclusion**:
- The claim is somewhat accurate but lacks nuance, as it does not account for the differences between various segments of the energy sector.

1. **""Produce in Georgia"" Program**: This is a government initiative aimed at supporting and promoting local production and business development in various sectors, including tourism and hospitality.

2. **Encouragement of Hotels**: The term ""encouraged"" typically means that the program has provided some form of support, which could include financial assistance, grants, subsidies, or other incentives to develop or enhance hotel infrastructure.

3. **Kakheti Region**: This is a well-known wine-producing region in Georgia, which has been a focus for tourism development.

To verify the claim, we would need to check official sources or reports from the ""Produce in Georgia"" program or relevant government announcements that confirm the support of 12 hotels specifically in the Kakheti region.

Assuming we have access to such information and it confirms that 12 hotels have indeed been supported under this program in the Kakheti region, the claim would be 'True'. If the number is slightly off or the support is not directly from the ""Produce in Georgia"" program, the rating might change accordingly.

1. **Historical Context**: Researching the history of crisis management centers in Georgia, we find that the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA/HS) has been operational for many years. GEMA/HS is responsible for coordinating disaster response and recovery efforts in the state.

2. **Current Status**: As of the latest information, GEMA/HS continues to function as the primary agency for crisis management in Georgia. This includes managing natural disasters, public health emergencies, and other crises.

Given this information:
- The claim that Georgia was ranked 100th in 2006 is incorrect; it was actually ranked 112th.
- The claim that Georgia improved to 6th place is also slightly off; it improved to 7th place.

2. **Giorgi Kvirikashvili's Role**: Giorgi Kvirikashvili served as the Prime Minister of Georgia from December 30, 2015, to June 13, 2018. During his tenure, the responsibility for presenting the budget would depend on Georgian law.

Given these points, if Georgian law does not specifically require the Prime Minister to present the budget, the claim would be false. If it does, and Giorgi Kvirikashvili did not present the budget, the claim would be true.

1. **Review the 2017 Budget**: The 2017 budget would include various allocations and initiatives planned by the government for that fiscal year. This document would outline the financial priorities and any new programs or changes in funding.

2. **Electoral Legislation**: Electoral legislation typically refers to laws and regulations governing the conduct of elections, campaign financing, voting procedures, etc. If there were significant electoral reforms or new laws passed prior to or during the preparation of the 2017 budget, these might necessitate new initiatives or changes in budget allocations.

3. **Cross-Referencing**: By cross-referencing the content of the 2017 budget with any new electoral legislation passed around that time, we can determine if the budget includes initiatives directly resulting from such legislation.

Without specific details on the 2017 budget and the electoral legislation in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is being made in a context where no significant electoral legislation influenced the budget, the claim could be considered accurate.

**Hypothetical Analysis**:
- If the 2017 budget does not mention any new initiatives related to electoral legislation, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there are some minor references but not substantial initiatives, it might be 'Mostly True'.
- If there are notable initiatives but not the primary focus, it could be 'Half True'.
- If there are significant initiatives stemming from electoral legislation, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific details, we can make an educated guess based on typical budgetary practices and the nature of electoral legislation.

2. **Employment Rates**: Changes in employment and unemployment rates can indicate economic activity.
3. **Inflation Rates**: Inflation can affect the perceived pace of economic growth.
4. **Investment Levels**: Both domestic and foreign investments are indicators of economic confidence and growth.
5. **Sectoral Performance**: Different sectors (e.g., manufacturing, services, agriculture) may have varied growth rates.

Without specific data and a comprehensive analysis of these factors, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, the statement ""increased at least twofold in all directions"" is quite broad and implies a significant and uniform improvement across all economic indicators, which is rare and difficult to substantiate.

Given the general nature of the claim and the typical variability in economic performance across different sectors and indicators, it is unlikely that the pace of the economy has uniformly doubled in all aspects.

2. **Causation**: Can these losses be directly attributed to the decisions made by the mayor? This would require a clear link between specific decisions and the financial impact.
3. **Context and Scale**: Understanding the overall budget of Poti and the proportion of the losses in relation to the total budget would provide context to the claim.

1. **Historical Data**: Review historical budget revenue data to identify the highest recorded revenue figures.
2. **Current Data**: Look at the most recent budget revenue figures.
3. **Adjustments for Inflation**: Consider whether the figures are adjusted for inflation, as nominal increases over time may not represent real growth.

If the current budget revenues are indeed the highest ever recorded, even after adjusting for inflation, the claim would be 'True'. If they are among the highest but not the absolute maximum, it might be 'Mostly True'. If they are high but not close to the maximum, it could be 'Half True'. If they are not particularly high compared to historical data, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

The percentage of a population living in poverty can vary significantly depending on the country, the definition of poverty used, and the time period in question.

1. **Country Context**: Different countries have different poverty rates. For example, in some developing countries, the poverty rate might be higher, while in many developed countries, it is typically lower.

2. **Definition of Poverty**: Poverty can be defined in various ways, such as absolute poverty (living on less than a certain amount per day) or relative poverty (earning less than a certain percentage of the median income).

3. **Data Source and Time Period**: Reliable data sources such as the World Bank, United Nations, or national statistics offices provide updated and accurate poverty statistics. The time period of the data is also crucial, as poverty rates can change over time due to economic conditions, policy changes, and other factors.

Without specific information about the country, the definition of poverty, and the time period, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, globally, it is unlikely that 50% of the entire world's population lives in poverty according to most standard definitions.

The region has been a point of contention between Georgia and Russia, with Russia recognizing Abkhazia's independence and Georgia considering it part of its sovereign territory.

2. **Electricity Supply**: Historically, the electricity supply to Abkhazia has been a complex issue involving both local and external sources. There have been instances where electricity supply issues have arisen due to technical, financial, or political reasons.

3. **Recent Developments**: To verify the specific claim, we would need to look at recent news reports, official statements from the Georgian government, and other credible sources. If there is no recent and credible evidence supporting the claim that the Georgian government has made a decision to cut off electricity to Abkhazia, the claim would be considered false.

It is highly unlikely that every single organization would report on the same specific elements.

2. **Specificity of Reports:** Different organizations have different focuses and priorities. Some may concentrate on voter turnout, others on security, and still others on procedural integrity. Not all reports would necessarily mention elements gathered outside during the election.

According to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) data:

- In 2016, Georgia's GDP growth rate was approximately 2.8%.
- In 2017, Georgia's GDP growth rate was approximately 4.8%.

When comparing these figures to other countries in the region (such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Russia):

- Armenia had a GDP growth rate of 0.2% in 2016 and 7.5% in 2017.
- Azerbaijan had a GDP growth rate of -3.1% in 2016 and 0.1% in 2017.

- Russia had a GDP growth rate of -0.2% in 2016 and 1.5% in 2017.

Based on this data, Georgia's economic growth in 2016 was not among the highest in the region, but in 2017, it was relatively high compared to some of its neighbors, though not the highest.

If there is clear and reliable evidence showing that the sown area has indeed increased due to the spring work support program, then the original claim would be 'False'. Conversely, if there is no significant increase or the evidence is inconclusive, the original claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

1. **True**: This would mean there is clear evidence that the state does not interfere or influence the football federation elections in any way.
2. **Mostly True**: This would mean the state generally maintains neutrality, but there might be minor exceptions or isolated incidents.
3. **Half True**: This would mean the state sometimes maintains neutrality, but there are significant instances where it does not.
4. **Mostly False**: This would mean the state generally does not maintain neutrality, but there might be minor instances where it does.
5. **False**: This would mean there is clear evidence that the state consistently interferes or influences the football federation elections.

Without specific evidence or context regarding the state's involvement in the football federation elections, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume a general scenario where there is no known evidence of state interference, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

1. **United States**: In the U.S., federal judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, without a formal competitive process. However, state judges may be selected through various methods, including elections, merit-based appointments, or gubernatorial appointments, which may or may not involve a competitive process.

2. **United Kingdom**: In the UK, judicial appointments are typically made by the Judicial Appointments Commission, which conducts a competitive selection process. However, there may be instances where promotions within the judiciary do not involve a new competition.

3. **Other Countries**: Different countries have different systems for judicial appointments and promotions. Some may involve competitive exams or merit-based selections, while others may rely on appointments without a formal competition.

Given the variability in judicial appointment and promotion processes across different jurisdictions, the claim could be true in some contexts and false in others. Without specific details about the jurisdiction in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

1. **Verification of Records**: Are there reliable and comprehensive records available for the temporary detention facility in question?
2. **Credibility of Sources**: Are the sources reporting on the facility credible and unbiased?
3. **Scope of Reporting**: Does the absence of recorded incidents mean that no violations occurred, or could it be due to underreporting or lack of proper documentation?

If the facility has thorough and transparent records maintained by credible sources, and there is no evidence of human rights violations, the claim could be considered true. However, if there is any possibility of underreporting, lack of transparency, or biased reporting, the claim's accuracy could be compromised.

Given the potential for underreporting or lack of transparency in many detention facilities, it is often challenging to assert with complete certainty that no human rights violations have occurred solely based on the absence of recorded incidents.

2. Whether investments specifically decreased in agriculture during that period.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, we can analyze the structure of the statement.

The claim states:
- ""In the three quarters of 2015, investments decreased by 17%.""
- ""Investments have decreased in agriculture.""

If the first part of the claim is accurate and investments overall decreased by 17%, and if the second part is also accurate that investments in agriculture decreased, then the claim would be 'True'. However, if either part is inaccurate, the claim would be less than fully true.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most cautious approach would be to consider the possibility of some inaccuracy.

2. **Participation**: Are there barriers that prevent women from participating fully in local government?
3. **Challenges**: Are there systemic issues or crises specifically affecting women's involvement in local government?

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we consider global trends and common issues, women often face significant barriers to equal participation in local governance, including cultural, social, and institutional obstacles.

Given the general understanding of these issues, the claim that there is a ""catastrophic situation"" might be an exaggeration, but it does highlight real and significant challenges.

3. Whether the report from the previous month supports these claims.

Without specific data or access to the report mentioned, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on accurate and verified data from the report, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the phrasing, it suggests that the report from the previous month indicates a decrease in revenues and a serious shortfall in the budget. If we take this at face value and assume the report is accurate, the claim would be 'True'.

This would involve checking official statements, reports, or actions taken by the National Bank in response to the IMF's recommendations.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm or refute the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verified information that the National Bank explicitly ignored or did not act upon the IMF's recommendation, then the claim would be 'True'. Conversely, if there is evidence that the National Bank did consider the recommendation, even if they did not fully implement it, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

1. The budget increased tenfold under the governance of the political team.
2. The economy grew by 7-8% under the governance of the political team.

Without specific details about the time period, country, or political team in question, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, we can consider the general plausibility of such claims.

1. **Budget Increase Tenfold**: A tenfold increase in a national budget is an extraordinary claim. It would typically require a very long period or an exceptional set of circumstances, such as hyperinflation, significant economic reforms, or a very low starting point. Such a dramatic increase is rare but not impossible.

2. **Economic Growth of 7-8%**: Sustained economic growth rates of 7-8% are high but achievable, especially in developing or rapidly industrializing countries. Many countries have experienced such growth rates during periods of significant economic reform or development.

Given the extraordinary nature of the first claim and the more plausible nature of the second, the overall claim seems to be an exaggeration but not entirely implausible.

1. ""Every seventh person buys food with borrowed money"" suggests that approximately 14.3% of the population relies on borrowed money for food. This could be plausible in certain economic conditions, but without specific data, we cannot confirm its accuracy.

2. ""Every third person is..."" is an incomplete statement. Without knowing what the second part of the claim is, we cannot evaluate its truthfulness.

1. **Role of Geostat**: The National Statistics Office of Georgia is responsible for collecting and analyzing statistical data, including price indices and inflation rates. They conduct various surveys to gather data on consumer prices, which can include medication prices.

2. **Population Survey**: Geostat typically uses household surveys and other data collection methods to gather information on consumer prices. These surveys can involve collecting data from a sample of the population to understand price changes.

Given this information, the claim that the change in medication prices is determined by the National Statistics Office of Georgia through a population survey is generally accurate. However, it is important to note that while population surveys are a significant method, they may not be the only method used by Geostat to determine price changes.

1. **Expenditure Exceeded by 703 Million GEL**: This means that the actual spending was 703 million GEL more than what was initially planned or budgeted.

2. **Tax Revenues Fell Short by 633 Million GEL**: This indicates that the actual tax revenue collected was 633 million GEL less than what was projected or expected.

To verify these claims, we would need access to the official budget reports or financial statements for the year 2013 from the relevant government authorities or financial institutions. Without access to these specific documents, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the exact figures.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate data from reliable sources, we can tentatively assess it as follows:

- If the figures are correct and sourced from official budget reports, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the figures are somewhat accurate but not exact, the claim might be 'Mostly True'.
- If the figures are partially correct but significantly off, the claim could be 'Half True'.
- If the figures are largely incorrect, the claim would be 'Mostly False'.

1. **Electoral System in Georgia (2016)**: In 2016, Georgia used a mixed electoral system. This system combined proportional representation (77 seats) and majoritarian (single-member district) representation (73 seats).

2. **Election Results**: In the 2016 parliamentary elections, ""Georgian Dream"" won a significant majority. They secured 44 seats through proportional representation and 71 seats through majoritarian districts, totaling 115 seats out of 150.

3. **Bonus Mandates**: The concept of ""bonus mandates"" typically refers to additional seats awarded to a party to ensure a stable majority, but this is not a standard feature of the Georgian electoral system. The results were based on the actual votes and the mixed system in place.

Given this information, the claim that ""Georgian Dream"" would receive ""only 12 mandates as a bonus"" does not align with the actual electoral system or the results of the 2016 elections. There were no specific ""bonus mandates"" awarded; the seats were won through the established mixed electoral process.

Without specific, up-to-date information on the water quality in Khelvachauri, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a general understanding or a common issue in the region, we can make an educated guess.

1. **Natural Gas Access**: According to various reports and data from energy agencies, a significant portion of Georgia's population does have access to natural gas. However, access can vary widely between urban and rural areas.

2. **Heating Methods**: In rural areas, it is more common for households to use alternative heating methods, including firewood, due to the lack of infrastructure for natural gas. However, this does not necessarily mean that half of the entire population of Georgia relies on firewood for heating.

3. **Statistical Data**: Specific statistics from energy surveys and national reports would provide the most accurate information. For instance, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and other local surveys could offer insights into the percentage of households using different heating methods.

Given the lack of precise data in the claim and the general understanding that while a notable portion of rural households may use firewood, it is unlikely to be as high as half of the entire state's population, the claim seems exaggerated.

Generally, loans can be taken for various purposes, including but not limited to infrastructure projects. These purposes can include operational expenses, refinancing existing debt, funding research and development, or other capital expenditures.

If the entity making the claim is a government or a specific organization that has a policy or track record of taking loans exclusively for infrastructure projects, the claim could be more accurate. However, without specific evidence or context to support that this is the only use of loans for the entity in question, it is difficult to definitively state that the claim is entirely true.

Given the general nature of loan usage across different entities, the claim is likely an overstatement.

1. **Verification of the Ranking**: Check if Georgia is indeed ranked 24th in the business doing ranking.
2. **Change in Methodology**: Confirm if there was a change in the methodology used for the ranking.
3. **Impact of Methodology Change**: Determine if the change in methodology directly caused Georgia to move to the 24th place.

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable source, we can analyze it as follows:

- If Georgia is ranked 24th and there was a recent change in the ranking methodology, it is plausible that the change in methodology could have influenced Georgia's position.

If the primary or significant reason for the reduction in ""other revenues"" is a decrease in fines, then the claim would be 'True'. If the decrease in fines is one of several reasons but not the main cause, the claim would be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True' depending on the extent of its impact.

1. **Previous President's Pardons**: 
   - If we consider recent U.S. presidents, Barack Obama, for example, granted 1,927 clemencies (including pardons and commutations) during his two terms.
   - Donald Trump granted 237 clemencies (including pardons and commutations) during his term.

2. **Current President's Pardons**:
   - If the current president is Joe Biden, as of the latest data, he has granted a significantly lower number of pardons and commutations compared to the claim of 3,500.

Given this information, the claim that the previous president pardoned 35,000 people is highly exaggerated, and the claim that the current president pardoned 3,500 people is also significantly inflated.

Without access to this specific information, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a known and verified event, we can make a general assessment.

If the claim is based on a well-documented and verified event where the previous government indeed sold state property at a minimal price to a specially created company, then the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If there are significant nuances or missing context, it might be 'Half True'. If the claim is largely inaccurate or misleading, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

1. The government claims to have received 355 million from investments.
2. Out of this 355 million, 207 million was spent on equipment.

To evaluate the truthfulness of this claim, we need to verify the following:
- Whether the government indeed received 355 million from investments.
- Whether 207 million of that amount was spent on equipment.

If both figures are accurate and verifiable, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies but the overall statement is mostly accurate, it would be 'Mostly True'. If the statement is partially accurate but contains significant inaccuracies, it would be 'Half True'. If the statement is largely inaccurate but contains some elements of truth, it would be 'Mostly False'. If the statement is entirely inaccurate, it would be 'False'.

Without additional context or data to verify these figures, we can only assess the logical consistency of the statement. The statement logically follows that if 355 million was received and 207 million was spent on equipment, the remaining amount would be 148 million (355 million - 207 million).

If the increase is minimal or the data is mixed, it could be 'Half True'. If the data shows a decrease or no significant change, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

The claim states that the only negative assessment in these reports was about the last vote.

1. **Venice Commission Reports**: The Venice Commission, an advisory body of the Council of Europe, provides legal opinions on constitutional matters. Their reports often cover a range of issues, including electoral laws, human rights, and democratic standards.

2. **OSCE Reports**: The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitors elections and provides comprehensive reports on their findings. These reports typically assess various aspects of the electoral process, including legal frameworks, campaign environments, media coverage, and the conduct of the vote itself.

Given the broad scope of both organizations' assessments, it is unlikely that their reports would focus solely on the last vote without addressing other aspects of the electoral process.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Georgia's population has been increasing over the past decade. For example, the population was approximately 10.6 million in 2020, up from about 9.7 million in 2010.

If the claim refers to the country of Georgia, the population trends would need to be checked against data from sources like the World Bank or the National Statistics Office of Georgia. However, even for the country of Georgia, a decrease of 800,000 people over five years would be significant and would likely be well-documented.

2. **Portfolio Investment**: This involves investing in securities like stocks and bonds without seeking control over the company. It is typically more short-term and speculative.

2. **Check their electoral systems**: We need to look at the electoral systems of these countries and see if they have switched from a proportional representation (PR) system to a mixed electoral system.

**Examples of countries more developed than Georgia:**

2. **Existing Jobs Being Lost**:

However, there are certain high-level documents, agreements, or orders that may require the Prime Minister's signature.

Without specific context about what ""such things"" refers to, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, given the general practice that Prime Ministers do not sign most documents personally, the claim leans towards being accurate.

Exchange rates are affected by a multitude of factors including, but not limited to, economic indicators (such as inflation rates, interest rates, and GDP growth), political stability, market speculation, and external economic conditions.

Speculative behavior can indeed have a significant impact on exchange rates, as traders' expectations and actions can drive short-term fluctuations. However, it is rarely the sole factor. Economic fundamentals and geopolitical events also play crucial roles in determining the value of a currency.

Given this context, the claim that the exchange rate of the lari is ""only"" the result of speculative behavior overlooks other important factors that influence exchange rates.

Let's break it down:
- Trade deficit: 3.5 billion
- Tourism revenues: 2 billion

If 2 billion in tourism revenues is used to cover the trade deficit, it means that 2 billion out of the 3.5 billion deficit is accounted for by tourism. This leaves a remaining deficit of 1.5 billion.

1. **NATO Standards**: NATO member countries do not have a single, unified conscription system. Each member country has its own approach to military conscription, ranging from mandatory service to professional volunteer forces. Therefore, there is no specific ""NATO standard"" for conscription.

2. **Georgia's Military Reforms**: Georgia has been working to align its military practices with NATO standards as part of its broader goal of NATO membership. This includes reforms in training, equipment, and operational procedures. However, aligning with NATO standards generally refers to interoperability, training, and operational readiness rather than conscription specifically.

3. **Official Statements and Policies**: If there are official statements or policies from the Georgian government indicating that their conscription system will be modeled after practices in NATO member countries, this would lend credibility to the claim. However, without specific details on how Georgia's conscription system will mirror those of NATO countries, the claim remains somewhat ambiguous.

Given these points, the claim that Georgia's conscription system will be implemented according to NATO member countries' standards is somewhat misleading because NATO does not have a unified conscription standard. However, Georgia's broader military reforms do aim to align with NATO practices.

1. **Demographic Indicators**: 
   - The ""Georgian Dream"" party has been in power since 2012. 
   - Key demographic indicators include birth rates, death rates, population growth, and age distribution.
   - If these indicators have worsened significantly since 2012 compared to the previous period, the claim could be considered accurate.

2. **Migration Balance**:
   - Migration balance refers to the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the country.
   - If the net migration balance has become more negative (i.e., more people leaving than entering) under the ""Georgian Dream"" compared to the previous period, this would support the claim.

**Data Analysis**:
- According to available data, Georgia has faced challenges with both demographic indicators and migration balance over the past decade.
- Birth rates have generally been declining, and the country has experienced significant emigration, contributing to a negative migration balance.
- However, it is essential to consider external factors such as economic conditions, regional stability, and global trends that might also influence these indicators.

**Conclusion**:
- While it is true that demographic indicators and migration balance have shown negative trends during the ""Georgian Dream"" administration, attributing these solely to the party's economic policies without considering other factors might be an oversimplification.

This is against the law and the rights of individuals...',"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Legal Framework**: Publishing personal identification numbers (PINs) typically violates privacy laws in many jurisdictions. For example, in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) strictly regulates the handling of personal data, including identification numbers. In the United States, various laws like the Privacy Act of 1974 and state-specific regulations protect personal information.

2. **Rights of Individuals**: The publication of personal identification numbers without consent generally infringes on individuals' privacy rights. This can lead to identity theft, fraud, and other privacy violations.

3. **Context of the Ministry of Justice**: If the Ministry of Justice in a specific country published such a list, it would likely be scrutinized under that country's privacy and data protection laws. If the publication was unauthorized or without proper legal basis, it would indeed be against the law and the rights of individuals.

Given these considerations, the claim that publishing a list of removed voters with personal identification numbers is against the law and the rights of individuals is well-supported by general privacy and data protection principles.

Without access to the specific budget documents or official statements, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the provided information is accurate and there are no additional context or details that could affect the interpretation, we can make an assessment based on the given data.

Given the straightforward nature of the claim, if the budget indeed increased by 1.2 million lari, the claim would be 'True'. If the increase is close to but not exactly 1.2 million lari, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the increase is significantly different, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on the extent of the discrepancy.

Several sources, such as the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing report by Cable.co.uk, provide comprehensive comparisons of mobile data costs across different countries. According to the 2022 report, Georgia is indeed listed among the countries with the lowest mobile data costs. This suggests that the claim has a strong basis in recent data.

However, the term ""one of the cheapest"" can be somewhat subjective and may depend on the specific metrics used (e.g., cost per GB, overall mobile service costs, etc.). Given that Georgia consistently ranks low in terms of mobile data costs, the claim is largely supported by available evidence.

Additionally, we need to check historical data to see if Georgia had ever been the leader in GDP growth rate before 2014.

1. **Georgia's GDP Growth Rate in 2014**: According to the World Bank, Georgia's GDP growth rate in 2014 was approximately 4.6%.

2. **Comparison with Other European Countries**: In 2014, several European countries had higher GDP growth rates than Georgia. For example:
   - Ireland had a GDP growth rate of around 8.5%.
   - Malta had a GDP growth rate of around 5.7%.
   - Luxembourg had a GDP growth rate of around 4.8%.

3. **Historical Context**: To verify if Georgia had ever been the leader in GDP growth rate before 2014, we would need to look at historical GDP growth data. However, based on available data, Georgia has not been the leader in GDP growth rate in Europe or the region in recent history.

Given this information, the claim that Georgia was in first place in Europe and the region in terms of GDP growth rate in 2014 is not accurate. Additionally, the assertion that it was never the leader previously is also not fully verifiable without extensive historical data, but it seems unlikely based on available information.

Without specific details or sources confirming these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verified information, we can proceed with an analysis.

If the construction was halted during the tenure of the ""Georgian Dream"" government and there is evidence that the government was responsible for the halt, the claim would be 'True'. If the construction was halted but not directly due to the government's actions, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

2. **2016 Parliament**: Identify the number of businessmen who were members of the 2016 Parliament.
3. **Comparison**: Calculate the ratio of the number of businessmen in the 2016 Parliament to the number in the 2012 Parliament.

- If the number of businessmen in the 2012 Parliament was X, then the number in the 2016 Parliament should be between 3X and 4X for the claim to be true.

For example, if there were 10 businessmen in the 2012 Parliament, the 2016 Parliament should have between 30 and 40 businessmen to satisfy the claim.

Without access to specific and up-to-date information from Rustavi City Hall or reliable sources that confirm these details, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable source or official statement, we can tentatively assess it.

The Georgian Dream party, which has been the ruling party in Georgia since 2012, has consistently expressed support for Georgia's integration into NATO. This is evident from various official statements and policy documents. For instance, the Georgian Dream government has continued to pursue NATO membership as a strategic goal, participating in NATO exercises and maintaining close cooperation with the alliance.

However, it is also important to note that while NATO membership is a significant goal, the Georgian Dream party has also prioritized other areas such as economic development, social welfare, and regional stability. Therefore, while NATO membership is a declared priority, it is one among several key priorities.

Given this context, the claim that ""The declared priority of the Georgian Dream is not NATO"" is misleading because it overlooks the fact that NATO membership is indeed a declared priority, even if it is not the sole or exclusive one.

Without access to the specific financial data for the current year, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is being made in a context where such data is available and has been verified by a credible source, we could assess its truthfulness based on that information.

1. **Historical Context**: Historically, during the colonial era, British attitudes towards colonized peoples often included perceptions of them as ""savages"" or ""uncivilized."" This was used to justify colonial rule and exploitation. However, these views were not universally held by all British people even at that time.

2. **Modern Context**: In contemporary times, British society is diverse and attitudes vary widely. While some individuals may hold prejudiced views, it is not accurate to say that all or even most British people see others as ""savages"" or ""criminals."" Modern British society generally promotes values of equality and multiculturalism, although issues of racism and prejudice do still exist.

3. **Generalization**: The claim makes a sweeping generalization about the attitudes of an entire nation, which is rarely accurate. Attitudes and perceptions are influenced by numerous factors including education, personal experiences, and media representation.

Given these points, the claim is an overgeneralization and does not accurately reflect the views of the entire British population.

1. **Regulations and Laws**: In many countries, financial and auditing regulations, such as those set by securities commissions or financial oversight bodies, often outline the role and responsibilities of auditors, including chief auditors. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States has specific provisions related to auditing practices and the responsibilities of auditors.

2. **Internal Normative Acts**: Organizations typically have internal policies and job descriptions that define the roles and responsibilities of their employees, including the chief auditor. These internal documents are normative acts that provide guidance on the expectations and duties of the position.

This phenomenon is often referred to as ""political business cycles"" or ""electoral cycles in welfare spending.""

2. **Research Findings**: Various academic studies have found mixed results. Some studies support the idea that there is an increase in social assistance or welfare spending before elections, while others do not find significant evidence to support this claim. The effect can also vary by country, political system, and the specific type of social assistance program.

3. **Contextual Factors**: The claim might hold more validity in certain contexts or countries where political manipulation of welfare programs is more prevalent. However, it is not a universal phenomenon and can be influenced by many factors, including economic conditions, legal constraints, and public scrutiny.

Given the mixed evidence and the context-dependent nature of the claim, it is not entirely accurate to state it as a universal truth. Therefore, the claim is best categorized as having some basis in reality but not being universally or consistently true.

1. **Specificity of the Claim**: The claim is quite broad and does not specify what ""something"" refers to. It could be detention, property seizure, surveillance, etc. The accuracy of the claim can vary significantly depending on what specific action is being referred to.

2. **Comparative Legislation**: Many countries have laws that allow for certain actions without a court decision under specific circumstances. For example, administrative detention without a court order is practiced in several countries under certain conditions, such as during states of emergency or for national security reasons.

3. **Global Legal Practices**: It is highly unlikely that any single country is the only one with such legislation, given the diversity of legal systems and practices around the world. Many countries have provisions for actions without court decisions in specific contexts.

Given the broad and unspecified nature of the claim, and the fact that many countries have similar provisions under certain circumstances, the claim is likely to be inaccurate.

The claim states:
- ""Parking Service"" contributed 166 thousand GEL to the budget.
- The expected contribution was 460 thousand GEL.
- 60% of the revenue was contributed.

Let's break down the claim:

1. If ""Parking Service"" indeed contributed 166 thousand GEL, this part of the claim is true.
2. If the expected contribution was 460 thousand GEL, this part of the claim is true.
3. If 166 thousand GEL represents 60% of the revenue, then the total revenue would be approximately 276.67 thousand GEL (since 166 / 0.60 ≈ 276.67).

To verify the claim, we need to check if these figures are accurate and consistent with the provided percentages.

If all these points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If some parts are accurate but not all, the claim could be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If most parts are inaccurate, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

1. **Stricter Tax Administration**: This implies that the government has implemented more rigorous measures to ensure compliance with tax laws within the gambling industry. This could include better tracking of gambling revenues, more frequent audits, and stricter penalties for non-compliance.

2. **Increased Revenues**: This part of the claim suggests that the total tax revenue collected from the gambling industry has risen.

To evaluate this claim, we would need data showing:
- Implementation of stricter tax measures.
- A corresponding increase in tax revenues from the gambling sector over recent years.

If there is evidence that stricter tax administration has been implemented and that tax revenues from the gambling industry have indeed increased as a result, the claim would be considered accurate. However, if the increase in revenues cannot be directly attributed to stricter tax administration, or if there is no clear evidence of such an increase, the claim would be less accurate.

2. **Indicators of Government Size**: Common indicators include:
   - Government spending as a percentage of GDP.
   - Number of public sector employees.
   - Tax revenue as a percentage of GDP.
   - Regulatory burden.

3. **Salaries to GDP Ratio**: The ratio of public sector salaries to GDP can be an indicator of government size, as it reflects the portion of the economy dedicated to paying government employees. However, it is not the sole or primary indicator. It is one of several metrics that can provide insight into the size of the government.

Given this context, the claim that the ratio of salaries to GDP is an indicator of a small government is partially accurate but not comprehensive.

1. Whether the lari (the currency of Georgia) was indeed devalued by 70%.
2. Whether no neighboring country has experienced a similar devaluation.

### Step 1: Verify the Devaluation of the Lari
- The lari has experienced significant fluctuations in value over the years. However, a 70% devaluation is a substantial figure and would likely be well-documented in financial news and reports.
- Historical exchange rate data and financial reports from the National Bank of Georgia or other financial institutions would provide evidence of such a devaluation.

### Step 2: Compare with Neighboring Countries
- Georgia's neighboring countries include Russia, Turkey, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.
- We need to check the recent history of currency devaluations in these countries to see if any have experienced a devaluation of a similar magnitude (70%).

### Research Findings
- If the lari was indeed devalued by 70%, this would be a significant economic event and should be verifiable through financial records.
- Comparing this with neighboring countries, we would need to look at the recent economic history of each to confirm if any have had a similar devaluation.

### Conclusion
Without specific data at hand, we can make an educated guess based on general knowledge and trends. If the lari was devalued by 70%, it is plausible that this is a significant outlier compared to neighboring countries, which have not experienced such extreme devaluations in recent years.

If the claim is referring to a specific type of illegal activity (e.g., illegal immigration, illegal businesses, illegal drugs, etc.), it would be important to verify whether Georgia has had mechanisms in place to address that specific issue. For example, if the claim is about illegal immigration, Georgia has had mechanisms such as law enforcement agencies and cooperation with federal immigration authorities. If the claim is about illegal businesses, there are regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies that monitor and address such issues.

Given the general nature of the claim and without specific context, it is difficult to assert that there have been no mechanisms at all. Georgia, like other states, has various law enforcement and regulatory agencies designed to identify and address illegal activities.

1. **Historical Context**: The Georgian Dream party has been in power since 2012. Any significant changes in public sector employment would likely be documented in government reports, independent analyses, or media coverage.

2. **Data Sources**: Reliable sources such as government statistics, reports from international organizations (e.g., World Bank, IMF), and reputable news outlets should be consulted to verify changes in public sector employment.

3. **Verification**: If data from these sources confirm an increase of approximately 14,000 public servants during the Georgian Dream party's tenure, the claim can be considered accurate. If the increase is significantly different, the claim's accuracy would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Without access to specific data at this moment, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable data from reliable sources, we can make a reasoned judgment.

**Hypothetical Verification**:
- If data shows an increase close to 14,000, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the increase is somewhat close but not exactly 14,000, it might be 'Half True'.
- If the increase is significantly different, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

1. **Legal Framework**: In many jurisdictions, the payment of bonuses in state institutions is regulated by specific laws and regulations. These laws often stipulate the conditions under which bonuses can be paid, including the timing and approval processes.

2. **Advance Payments**: If the law explicitly states that bonuses can only be paid after certain conditions are met (e.g., end of the fiscal year, performance evaluations), then advance payments would indeed contradict the law.

3. **Exceptions and Specific Cases**: There might be exceptions or specific cases where advance payments are allowed under certain circumstances, such as emergency provisions or special approvals.

Without specific details about the jurisdiction and the exact legal provisions, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

1. **NATO's European Counterpart**: 
   - NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is a military alliance that includes both North American and European countries. There is no direct European counterpart to NATO that serves the same comprehensive military alliance function. However, the European Union (EU) has its own security and defense policy, known as the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), which aims to strengthen the EU's external ability to act through the development of civilian and military capabilities in conflict prevention and crisis management. While the CSDP is significant, it is not a direct counterpart to NATO in terms of scope and military integration.

2. **A Rift Among Western Countries**:
   - There have been instances of disagreements and differing perspectives among Western countries on various issues, including defense spending, foreign policy, and responses to global crises. These disagreements can be seen as rifts, but they do not necessarily indicate a fundamental or irreparable division within the Western alliance. NATO and the EU continue to function and cooperate despite these differences.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also some inaccuracies. The term ""NATO's European counterpart"" is somewhat misleading, and while there are disagreements among Western countries, calling it a ""rift"" might be an overstatement.

Specifically, it addressed concerns about the impartiality of the court due to the involvement of a judge who had previously participated in the case in a different capacity.

Given this information, the claim that ""Hrico v. Slovakia"" is a precedent related to protecting the impartiality of the court is accurate.

1. **Journalists' Union of Paraná**: This organization exists and is known to advocate for journalists' rights in the state of Paraná, Brazil.
2. **Pressuring reporters to reveal sources**: There have been documented instances in Brazil where journalists have faced pressure to reveal their sources, particularly in cases involving sensitive information or allegations against public officials, including police officers.
3. **Gazeta do Povo reports from 2012**: Gazeta do Povo is a well-known newspaper in Paraná, and it has published investigative reports that have led to various investigations and legal actions.
4. **Embarrassment**: The sentiment expressed about the situation being an embarrassment aligns with the general reaction from journalists and their unions when faced with such pressures.

1. **Public Information Laws**: Many countries have Freedom of Information (FOI) laws that allow citizens to request public information from government agencies, including audit services. If such laws were in place in 2012, it would generally not be ""impossible"" to request information, although there might be exceptions or limitations.

2. **Audit Service Practices**: The specific practices of the audit service in question would need to be examined. Some audit services might have had restrictive policies or bureaucratic hurdles that made it very difficult to obtain information, but ""impossible"" is a strong term.

3. **Evidence and Reports**: If there are documented cases or reports from 2012 indicating that requests for public information from the audit service were consistently denied or ignored, this would support the claim. Conversely, if there are examples of successful information requests, this would contradict the claim.

Given the need for specific evidence and the strong wording of ""impossible,"" without concrete evidence to support the absolute nature of the claim, it is more likely that the claim is exaggerated.

1. **International Trade Context**: Anti-dumping legislation typically refers to laws that prevent foreign companies from selling goods below market value to undermine local industries. The United States, including the state of Georgia, is subject to federal anti-dumping laws enforced by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission. These laws are designed to protect U.S. industries from unfair competition.

2. **Local Environmental Context**: Anti-dumping can also refer to local laws that prevent illegal disposal of waste. Georgia has state laws and regulations that prohibit illegal dumping of waste materials to protect the environment and public health.

1. **Geographical Proximity**: Greece and Georgia are both located in the southeastern part of Europe and the Caucasus region, respectively. They are not immediate neighbors but are relatively close in a broader regional context.

2. **Economic Ties**: The economic relationship between Greece and Georgia is not particularly strong. Greece's economic events might have some indirect effects on Georgia, especially if they influence broader regional economic conditions or the European Union, of which Greece is a member.

3. **Political and Social Influence**: Political events in Greece could have some influence on Georgia, especially if they pertain to regional stability, migration patterns, or international relations within the region.

4. **Historical and Cultural Links**: While both countries have rich histories and cultural heritages, their direct historical and cultural links are limited.

Given these considerations, the claim that events in Greece will ""definitely"" have an impact on Georgia seems to overstate the certainty and magnitude of the impact. While there could be some influence, it is not guaranteed or necessarily significant.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2021, the national debt of the United States has been increasing significantly each year, often by hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. For example, the national debt increased by approximately $4.2 trillion in 2020 alone due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related stimulus measures.

Given this context, an increase of more than 3 billion over three years is a very conservative estimate and is likely to be true. The national debt has increased by much more than 3 billion over the past three years.

Deficit spending occurs when a government spends more money than it receives in revenue, typically financed by borrowing. This can affect the money supply in several ways:

1. **Direct Impact**: If the government borrows from the central bank, it can lead to an increase in the money supply because the central bank may create new money to purchase government bonds.
2. **Indirect Impact**: If the government borrows from the public or financial institutions, the immediate effect on the money supply might be neutral, as it involves transferring existing money from lenders to the government. However, the subsequent spending by the government can increase the money supply as it circulates through the economy.

Given these mechanisms, it is generally expected that deficit spending will have some impact on the money supply, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, the claim that ""the deficit spending of the budget has not affected the amount of money in circulation"" is likely to be inaccurate.

The claim suggests that the law is an attempt to depoliticize the prosecution body but ultimately fails to do so, keeping it under the control of the ruling party.

1. **Imitation of Depoliticizing**: This implies that the law appears to aim at reducing political influence but does not genuinely achieve this goal.
2. **Control of the Ruling Party**: This suggests that despite the law, the ruling party still maintains significant influence over the prosecution system.

Without specific details about the law in question, its provisions, and the actual political dynamics, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the law has provisions that ostensibly aim to reduce political influence but there is evidence or widespread belief that the ruling party still exerts control, the claim could be seen as having some basis in truth but also being somewhat subjective.

Given the lack of concrete details and the potential for varying interpretations, the most balanced assessment would be:

The claim states that except for the year 2008, more people were returning to Georgia than leaving.

1. Identify the presidency period: The claim does not specify which president or the exact years of the presidency. For the sake of this analysis, let's assume it refers to a recent U.S. president, such as George W. Bush (2001-2009) or Barack Obama (2009-2017).

2. Check migration data: We need to look at the net migration data for Georgia during the specified presidency period. Net migration is the difference between the number of people moving into the state and the number of people moving out.

3. Analyze the data: If the net migration data shows a positive number (more people moving in than out) for all years except 2008, the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows mixed results or other years with negative net migration, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Without specific data, we can only hypothesize based on general trends. Historically, Georgia has seen periods of both positive and negative net migration, influenced by economic conditions, job opportunities, and other factors.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge and the assumption that the claim is about a recent presidency, it is likely that there were fluctuations in migration patterns.

2. **Growth in Agriculture**: Whether the agricultural sector has shown growth in terms of output, productivity, or other relevant metrics.
3. **Share in the Economy**: Whether the share of agriculture in the overall economy has increased, decreased, or remained stagnant.

### Analysis:

1. **Investment in Agriculture**:
   - If there has been substantial investment in agriculture, this part of the claim could be true.

2. **Growth in Agriculture**:
   - If the agricultural sector has not shown significant growth despite the investment, this part of the claim could be true.

3. **Share in the Economy**:
   - The share of agriculture in the economy can decrease even if the sector grows, especially if other sectors grow at a faster rate. This part of the claim could be true if the share of agriculture in the economy has indeed decreased or remained stagnant.

### Conclusion:
Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the investment did not lead to proportional growth in agriculture and its share in the economy did not increase, the claim could be considered accurate to a certain extent.

   - Portugal is well-known for decriminalizing the possession of all drugs in 2001.
   - The Czech Republic has also decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use.
   - Additionally, several other European countries have adopted various forms of decriminalization or depenalization, including Spain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, among others.

2. **Situation Worsening:**
   - In Portugal, the decriminalization policy is often cited as a success, with significant reductions in drug-related deaths, HIV infection rates, and overall drug use.
   - The Czech Republic has not reported a significant worsening of the drug situation since decriminalization.

Given this information, the claim that only two countries in Europe have decriminalized drug possession is incorrect, and the assertion that the situation has worsened in those countries is also not supported by evidence.

2. **There is no sign of improvement in Georgian football**: This is a subjective statement and can be evaluated by looking at various indicators such as the performance of the national team, the development of football infrastructure, youth programs, and other relevant metrics over recent years.

In many governmental systems, the executive body (such as a mayor or governor) is responsible for preparing and proposing a budget. The legislative body (such as a city council or state legislature) typically has the authority to review, amend, and approve the budget. However, the legislative body generally cannot compel the executive to include specific items in the initial budget proposal. Instead, the legislative body can make amendments or adjustments during the budget approval process.

Given this general understanding, the claim that ""The council is not legally authorized to obligate the executive body to include any item in the budget"" aligns with the typical separation of powers and responsibilities in budget processes.

1. **Historical Context**: Georgia and Russia have had a complex trade relationship, especially after the 2008 conflict. Trade dynamics can fluctuate significantly due to political and economic factors.

2. **Trade Data**: If we look at trade statistics from reliable sources such as the National Statistics Office of Georgia or international trade databases, we can verify if there was indeed a tripling of exports to Russia.

3. **Time Frame**: The claim does not specify a time frame. If we consider a specific period, such as from 2010 to 2020, we need to check if the exports increased threefold during that time.

4. **Embargo Context**: The mention of an embargo implies a political dimension. Russia has imposed and lifted various trade restrictions on Georgian products over the years.

Without specific data at hand, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent trends and available data, we can make an educated assessment.

**Research Findings**:
- According to trade data, there have been periods where Georgian exports to Russia have significantly increased, especially after the lifting of certain embargoes.
- For instance, Georgian wine exports to Russia saw a substantial increase after the 2013 lifting of a 7-year embargo.

Given these points, the claim that Georgia managed to triple its exports to the Russian market could be plausible, but it would depend on the specific time frame and context.

The claim states that during the previous administration, there was economic growth along with a sharp (unspecified event or trend).

1. **Economic Growth**: We need to verify if there was indeed economic growth during the specified period. This can be done by looking at GDP growth rates, employment rates, and other economic indicators from reliable sources such as government reports, economic analyses, and reputable news outlets.

2. **Sharp (unspecified event or trend)**: The claim mentions a ""sharp"" change but does not specify what it is. This could refer to a variety of factors such as inflation, unemployment, inequality, or other economic or social indicators. We need to identify what this ""sharp"" change refers to and verify its occurrence during the same period.

Without specific details about the ""sharp"" change and the exact period of the previous administration, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

Georgia is known for its relatively low tax rates and business-friendly tax policies. The country has a flat income tax rate of 20%, a corporate tax rate of 15%, and a value-added tax (VAT) rate of 18%. These rates are generally considered low compared to many other countries.

For comparison:
- Armenia has a progressive income tax rate ranging from 23% to 36%, a corporate tax rate of 18%, and a VAT rate of 20%.
- Azerbaijan has a flat income tax rate of 14% for individuals and 20% for businesses, with a VAT rate of 18%.
- Turkey has a progressive income tax rate ranging from 15% to 40%, a corporate tax rate of 20%, and a VAT rate of 18%.

1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per Capita**: This is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people. If the GDP per capita in dollars has decreased, it would indicate a reduction in economic productivity or an increase in population without a corresponding increase in GDP.

2. **Private Sector Metrics**: The claim mentions a decrease in private sector metrics, but it is not specific about which metrics are being referred to. Common metrics could include private investment, business growth, employment rates, etc.

To verify the claim, we would need to look at recent economic data from reliable sources such as government reports, international financial institutions (like the World Bank or IMF), and economic research organizations.

Without specific data to confirm or refute the claim, we can only assess it based on general trends and available information up to the knowledge cutoff in 2023. Economic conditions can vary significantly by country and over time, so a blanket statement about a ""catastrophe"" in all numbers may be an exaggeration or an oversimplification.

Conversely, more relaxed visa regulations can boost tourism by making it easier for people to visit.

2. **Economic Impact**: Tourism is a significant contributor to the economy in many countries. A decrease in tourism can lead to economic problems, particularly in regions heavily dependent on tourist revenue. This can affect various sectors, including hospitality, transportation, and retail.

Defense budgets generally include a variety of expenditures such as personnel costs (salaries and benefits), operations and maintenance, procurement of equipment, research and development, and other expenses.

In most countries, while a significant portion of the defense budget is indeed allocated to personnel costs, it is usually not as high as 80%. For example, in the United States, personnel costs typically account for around 25-30% of the total defense budget.

1. **March Economic Growth of 6%**: This is a specific data point. If this figure is accurate, it indicates a strong monthly growth rate. However, monthly growth rates can be volatile and are not necessarily indicative of long-term trends.

2. **Annual Forecast of 5%**: This suggests that the country is expected to grow by 5% over the entire year. Annual forecasts are typically based on a variety of economic indicators and models.

3. **High Economic Growth**: Generally, an annual growth rate of 5% is considered high for most economies, especially developed ones. For developing economies, this might be more common but still indicates robust growth.

Given these points, the claim that the country is experiencing high economic growth is supported by the provided data points. However, the statement could be somewhat misleading if the 6% growth in March is an outlier or if the annual forecast is not met.

1. **Economic Principles**: Generally, the devaluation of a currency can have various impacts on a country's economy, including its budget. Devaluation can lead to increased costs for imported goods and services, which can affect government expenditures if the government relies on imports for its operations or projects. Conversely, it can also increase revenues from exports if the country is export-oriented.

2. **Contextual Information**: Without specific data or context about Georgia's budget and economic conditions during the period in question, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that Nodar Khaduri, a former Minister of Finance of Georgia, is referring to a situation where the budget was not directly impacted by the devaluation, it might be due to specific fiscal policies or economic conditions that mitigated the impact.

Given the general economic principles and the lack of specific contextual data, the claim that the devaluation of the lari has not caused budget expenditures seems to be an oversimplification.

A plea agreement typically involves the defendant agreeing to plead guilty to a lesser charge or to one of several charges in exchange for a lighter sentence or other concessions.

3. **Expert Opinions and Studies**: Legal experts, criminologists, or studies on the criminal justice system might offer insights into the prevalence of plea agreements in weapon possession cases.

Without specific statistical data or expert analysis directly at hand, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given the general knowledge that plea agreements are a common resolution method in many criminal cases, it is reasonable to infer that they are likely used frequently in cases of illegal weapon possession.

1. Whether the Partnership Fund has indeed been operating at a loss for the past 4 years.
2. Whether the total loss amounts to 700 million GEL.

Without specific financial data or reports from the Partnership Fund, it is challenging to confirm the exact figures. However, if we assume that the claim is based on available financial reports and data, we can analyze the likelihood of its accuracy.

If the Partnership Fund has consistently reported losses over the past 4 years and the cumulative loss is around 700 million GEL, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies in the exact amount or the duration, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

1. **Tax Policy and Investment**: It is common for regions to implement favorable tax policies to attract investors. These policies can include tax incentives, lower tax rates, or measures that provide stability and predictability in the tax environment.

2. **Referendums on Tax Increases**: Some jurisdictions may have norms or laws that require a public referendum before any tax increases can be implemented. This can be seen as a way to ensure that tax policies remain stable and predictable, which can be attractive to investors who seek a stable financial environment.

3. **Attracting Investors**: Stability in tax policy is a significant factor for investors. Knowing that tax increases cannot occur without a referendum can provide a sense of security and predictability, which are attractive qualities for investment.

Given these points, the claim that a norm prohibiting tax increases without a referendum is one of the measures to attract investors is generally accurate. Such a norm can indeed be part of a broader strategy to create a stable and predictable investment climate.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smoking is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States, contributing to various diseases such as heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and cancer. However, the claim that two out of every three people in Georgia die from smoking-related diseases seems exaggerated.

Nationally, smoking-related deaths account for about one in five deaths, according to the CDC. This statistic is consistent across many states, including Georgia.

1. **Existence of Normative Acts**: We need to confirm whether there are indeed four specific normative acts that address the protection of the population from genetically modified products.
2. **Content of Normative Acts**: We need to verify that these acts explicitly obligate protection against genetically modified products.

Without specific information on the normative acts in question, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on actual legal documents, we can make an educated guess.

Given the general trend in many countries to regulate genetically modified products for safety, it is plausible that there are multiple legal frameworks addressing this issue. However, the exact number and the specific obligations can vary.

2. **Global Rankings**: While Georgia is indeed rich in biodiversity, global rankings of biodiversity typically highlight countries like Brazil, Indonesia, Colombia, and others with vast tropical rainforests and extensive ecosystems. These countries are often cited as having the highest biodiversity.

3. **Regional Significance**: Within its region, Georgia is highly significant for biodiversity, but on a global scale, it is less likely to be in the top 15 countries.

Specifically, we need to look at the government's borrowing and repayment figures for 2013 and 2014.

1. **Government Borrowing**: This includes the total amount of money the government borrowed through various means such as issuing bonds, taking loans, etc.
2. **Government Repayment**: This includes the total amount of money the government repaid, which could include paying off existing debt, interest payments, and other financial obligations.

If the total repayment amount exceeds the total borrowing amount for both years, the claim would be true. If the repayment is less than the borrowing, the claim would be false. If the data shows mixed results or is not clear-cut, the claim might fall into one of the intermediate categories.

Without specific data, we can only hypothesize based on general trends and available information from those years. Historically, many governments run budget deficits, meaning they borrow more than they repay.

For instance, global FDI flows saw a significant decline in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but showed signs of recovery in 2021 and 2022. However, the overall trend can vary based on economic conditions, geopolitical factors, and other influences.

2. **Georgia's Trends**: For Georgia, we need to look at specific data from sources such as the National Statistics Office of Georgia or international financial institutions. If recent reports indicate that Georgia has seen an increase in international investments, this would support the claim.

Given the complexity and variability of international investment trends, the claim could be evaluated as follows:

- If global FDI is generally decreasing but Georgia is experiencing an increase, the claim would be 'True'.
- If global FDI trends are mixed or not clearly decreasing, and Georgia is still seeing an increase, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.
- If global FDI is not decreasing or is increasing, and Georgia's increase is not significant, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Nothing has been done in terms of large-scale training for judges.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""nothing has been done in terms of large-scale training for judges,"" we need to consider the context and available evidence regarding judicial training programs.

1. **Judicial Training Programs**: Many countries have established judicial training institutes or academies that provide ongoing education and training for judges. For example, the National Judicial College in the United States offers a variety of courses and programs for judges. Similarly, other countries have their own institutions dedicated to judicial training.

2. **Large-Scale Training Initiatives**: There have been numerous large-scale training initiatives aimed at improving the skills and knowledge of judges. These initiatives often include mandatory continuing education, specialized training in new areas of law, and international collaborations.

3. **Recent Developments**: In recent years, there have been efforts to enhance judicial training, especially in response to new legal challenges and technological advancements. These efforts are often supported by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and international bodies.

Given this information, the claim that ""nothing has been done in terms of large-scale training for judges"" is not accurate. There have been significant efforts and initiatives aimed at providing large-scale training for judges.

ოთარ კახიძე თეა წულუკიანის მინისტრობის ათ პრობლემურ საკითხზე,true,ka,Otar Kakhidze on ten problematic issues during Tea Tsulukiani's tenure as minister.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Otar Kakhidze on ten problematic issues during Tea Tsulukiani's tenure as minister,"" we need to verify the specific issues Otar Kakhidze raised and whether they are factually supported. This requires a detailed examination of Kakhidze's statements and an assessment of Tea Tsulukiani's tenure as minister.

Without specific details on the ten issues mentioned by Otar Kakhidze, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that Kakhidze, a known political figure, has made public statements about these issues, and if these statements have been corroborated by credible sources or evidence, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific information in the query, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the general context and the need for more detailed verification:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False

Without additional context or evidence, it is challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of the statement.

However, based on the information provided, the claim suggests that the video recordings were a provocation and that the lawyer had visited Merabishvili on specific days (Saturday and Sunday). If we assume that the statement is made by someone with direct knowledge of the situation, it could be considered a subjective interpretation of events.

Given the lack of concrete evidence or additional context to fully verify the claim, the most appropriate classification would be 'Half True', as it acknowledges the possibility of partial accuracy while recognizing the need for further verification.

"წინა მთავრობის დროს საქართველოს ეკონომიკა უფრო სწრაფად იმიტომ იზრდებოდა, რომ მსოფლიო ეკონომიკა იზრდებოდა ორჯერ უფრო ძლიერად, ვიდრე ახლა",false,ka,The economy of Georgia was growing faster during the previous government because the world economy was growing twice as strongly as it is now.,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two main components:

1. The growth rate of Georgia's economy during the previous government.
2. The growth rate of the world economy during the same period compared to the current period.

### Step 1: Georgia's Economic Growth
We need to look at historical data on Georgia's economic growth rates during the tenure of the previous government. This would typically involve examining GDP growth rates over those years.

### Step 2: World Economic Growth
We also need to compare the global economic growth rates during the same periods. This involves looking at global GDP growth rates as reported by major financial institutions like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

### Analysis
- If the world economy was indeed growing twice as strongly during the previous government's tenure, it would imply a significant difference in global growth rates between the two periods.
- We also need to establish whether Georgia's economic growth was indeed faster during the previous government and if this can be attributed to the stronger global economy.

### Hypothetical Data (for illustration purposes):
- Suppose during the previous government, the world economy grew at an average rate of 4% per year.
- Currently, the world economy is growing at an average rate of 2% per year.
- If Georgia's economy grew at 6% per year during the previous government and is now growing at 3% per year, the claim might hold some validity.

### Conclusion
Without specific data, we can only hypothesize. However, if the world economy was indeed growing twice as strongly during the previous government and Georgia's economy was growing faster during that time, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True'. If the data does not support such a significant difference, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the need for precise data to make a definitive judgment, and assuming the claim is based on a general observation rather than exact figures, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False

1. Whether the Constitutional Court indeed made a purchase of new cars.
2. The total value of the purchase.
3. If the value matches the specified amount of half a million lari.

Without specific data or a reliable source to confirm these details, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a factual report or a credible source, we can analyze it accordingly.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I must refrain from making an assumption without proper verification.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
რუსეთის ჯარები საქართველოდან მე გავიყვანე,half true,ka,I withdrew Russian troops from Georgia.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I withdrew Russian troops from Georgia,"" we need to consider the historical context and specific details.

1. **Historical Context**: 
   - In August 2008, a conflict known as the Russo-Georgian War occurred between Russia and Georgia over the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
   - Following the war, Russia recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and Russian troops have remained in these regions.

2. **Withdrawal of Troops**:
   - While Russia did withdraw some troops from undisputed Georgian territory after the conflict, Russian military presence has continued in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which Georgia considers part of its sovereign territory.

3. **Current Status**:
   - As of the latest information, Russian troops are still stationed in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and these regions are not under Georgian control.

Given this context, the claim ""I withdrew Russian troops from Georgia"" is misleading because it implies a complete withdrawal, which is not the case. Russian troops remain in the breakaway regions.

1. **Existence of New Regulations**: Confirm if there were indeed new regulations on loans implemented recently.
2. **Impact on Microloans**: Check if these regulations specifically affected microloans up to 5,000 GEL.
3. **Decrease in Microloans**: Verify if there was a 26% decrease in microloans up to 5,000 GEL in February.

Without access to specific data or reports confirming these points, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the information provided is based on accurate and reliable sources, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the specificity of the claim (mentioning both the percentage decrease and the time frame), it suggests that there might be some basis in data or reports. However, without direct evidence, we cannot fully confirm its accuracy.

1. The overall percentage increase in wine exports from Georgia.
2. Specific data on the growth of wine exports to China and France.

Without access to the latest trade statistics and reports from reliable sources such as the Georgian National Wine Agency or international trade databases, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and accurate data, and considering that Georgia has been actively expanding its wine export markets, particularly in China, it is plausible that there has been significant growth.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact figures, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:
