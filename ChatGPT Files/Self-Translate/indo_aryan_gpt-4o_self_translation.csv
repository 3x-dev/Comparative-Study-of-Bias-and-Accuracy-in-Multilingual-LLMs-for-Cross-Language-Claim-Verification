1. ""The picture is of George Floyd"" - This part of the claim can be verified by comparing the picture in question to known images of George Floyd.

2. ""who recently died due to police brutality in Minneapolis, America"" - George Floyd did indeed die on May 25, 2020, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and his death was widely reported as a result of police brutality.

Given that both parts of the claim are accurate:

1. **Search for the Image**: Conduct a reverse image search to see if such a picture exists and is being circulated widely.
2. **Check Credible News Sources**: Look for reports from credible news outlets that confirm or debunk the claim.
3. **Social Media Verification**: Check social media platforms for the image and any accompanying context or fact-checks.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there have been no widely reported or verified instances of such a picture going viral. Additionally, given the political and business dynamics between Arvind Kejriwal and Mukesh Ambani, such an image would likely attract significant media attention, which does not appear to be the case.

ঘুমন্ত নারীর মতন দেখতে আলাস্কা পর্বত শৃঙ্গের এই ছবিকে প্লেন থেকে তোলা হয়েছে,mostly false,bn,"This picture of the Alaska mountain peak, which looks like a sleeping woman, was taken from a plane.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points: 

1. Whether there is a mountain peak in Alaska that resembles a sleeping woman.
2. Whether the picture in question was taken from a plane.

There is indeed a well-known mountain formation in Alaska called ""Sleeping Lady"" or ""Mount Susitna,"" which is said to resemble a sleeping woman. This part of the claim is true.

However, without the actual picture to verify if it was taken from a plane, we cannot definitively confirm this part of the claim. Given that it is common for such pictures to be taken from planes, it is plausible but not certain.

Given the information, the claim is mostly accurate but lacks complete verification for the second part.

इजरायली प्रधानमंत्री के बेटे की फोटो जो कि सेना में सेवा दे रहे हैं.,half true,hi,A photo of the Israeli Prime Minister's son who is serving in the army.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A photo of the Israeli Prime Minister's son who is serving in the army,"" we need to verify a few key points:

1. **Identity of the Israeli Prime Minister's Son**: We need to confirm if the Israeli Prime Minister has a son who is of age to serve in the army.
2. **Military Service**: In Israel, military service is mandatory for most citizens, so it is common for the children of public figures to serve.
3. **Authenticity of the Photo**: We need to verify if the photo in question is indeed of the Prime Minister's son and if it shows him in military service.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, the current Israeli Prime Minister is Benjamin Netanyahu. He has a son named Yair Netanyahu, who was born in 1991 and has served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). There are also other children, including Avner Netanyahu, who has also served in the IDF.

Given that it is common for Israeli citizens to serve in the military and that Netanyahu's sons have served, it is plausible that a photo could exist showing one of them in military uniform.

ছবির জাহাজটি বিশ্বের সব থেকে বড়ো জাহাজ,mostly false,bn,The ship in the picture is the largest ship in the world.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The ship in the picture is the largest ship in the world,"" we would need to verify the identity of the ship in the picture and compare its size to the current largest ship in the world. The largest ship in the world can vary depending on the criteria used (e.g., length, gross tonnage, or cargo capacity).

As I do not have access to the picture in question, I cannot verify the specific ship being referred to. Therefore, I cannot definitively assess the claim.

Explanation: The ghats of the Ganga River in Varanasi have historically faced issues with pollution and cleanliness. However, there have been significant efforts, especially under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to clean and maintain these ghats. While some areas may still experience issues with filth, there has been noticeable improvement in many parts. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but does not fully reflect the current situation.",half true,False,False
भारतीय सेना कश्मीरी महिलाओं का उत्पीड़न कर रही है,mostly false,hi,The Indian Army is oppressing Kashmiri women.,"The claim that ""The Indian Army is oppressing Kashmiri women"" is a highly contentious and politically sensitive issue. It is important to consider multiple perspectives and sources of information when evaluating such a claim.

1. **Human Rights Reports**: Various human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have documented instances of human rights abuses in Kashmir, including allegations of sexual violence and harassment by security forces. These reports suggest that there have been instances where Kashmiri women have faced oppression.

2. **Government and Military Statements**: The Indian government and the Indian Army often deny these allegations, stating that they operate under strict rules of engagement and that any violations are investigated and punished. They argue that the presence of the military is necessary to maintain law and order in a region affected by insurgency and terrorism.

3. **Local and International Media**: Media reports vary widely, with some highlighting the plight of Kashmiri women and others focusing on the challenges faced by the Indian Army in a conflict zone. The portrayal can be influenced by the media outlet's political stance and the sources they rely on.

4. **Independent Investigations**: Independent investigations and reports by journalists and NGOs sometimes corroborate the claims of oppression, but these are often contested by official sources.

Given the complexity and the varying accounts, the claim cannot be definitively categorized without acknowledging the nuances and the contested nature of the information.

Given that I don't have real-time access to current events or databases, I cannot verify this specific claim directly. However, I can guide you on how to verify it:

1. **Check Reliable News Sources:** Look for reports from reputable news organizations that have covered this incident.
2. **Official Statements:** Look for any statements from law enforcement agencies or government officials in Gujarat.
3. **Fact-Checking Websites:** Websites like Snopes, FactCheck.org, or local fact-checking organizations may have investigated this claim.

Without access to these sources, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if you have access to such information and it confirms the incident, you can categorize it accordingly.

1. The commencement of the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
2. Whether senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi fed sweets to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in relation to this event.

1. The construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya officially commenced with a groundbreaking ceremony on August 5, 2020, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
2. There is no widely reported or verified instance of Murli Manohar Joshi feeding sweets to Narendra Modi specifically in relation to the commencement of the Ram Temple construction.

1. Whether B.R. Shetty made any objectionable posts on Facebook about Tablighi Jamaat Muslims.
2. Whether the Dubai government has officially blacklisted B.R. Shetty for this reason.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there is no verified information or credible sources confirming that B.R.

কিছু মুসলিম মানুষ বলছেনসিএএ-এনআরসি ভুল নয়।,mostly false,bn,Some Muslim people are saying that the CAA-NRC is not wrong.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Some Muslim people are saying that the CAA-NRC is not wrong,"" we need to consider the diversity of opinions within any community, including the Muslim community. It is plausible that within any large group, there will be a range of perspectives on any given issue.

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) have been subjects of significant debate and controversy in India. While many Muslims and other groups have expressed strong opposition to these measures, it is also possible that some individuals within the Muslim community may hold a different view and believe that the CAA-NRC is not wrong.

Given the diversity of opinions that can exist within any community, the claim that ""some Muslim people are saying that the CAA-NRC is not wrong"" can be considered accurate to some extent.

ब्रायलर मुर्गी में पाया गया कोरोना वायरस,mostly false,hi,Coronavirus found in broiler chicken.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Coronavirus found in broiler chicken,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of coronaviruses.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can infect animals and humans. Different strains of coronaviruses affect different species. For example, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is a type of coronavirus that specifically affects poultry, including broiler chickens. However, this is not the same as the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic in humans.

Given that coronaviruses, in general, can be found in broiler chickens (specifically IBV), but not necessarily the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the claim is somewhat misleading without additional context.

Upon checking, there is no verifiable information or credible news reports confirming that an individual named Anil Upadhyay, who is a Congress MLA, exists or has been involved in such an incident. It appears that this claim may be fabricated or based on misinformation.

The video is said to be from the Pashupatinath Temple located in Nepal.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points: the presence of a huge waterfall falling onto a Shiva Linga and whether this is indeed from the Pashupatinath Temple in Nepal.

1. **Pashupatinath Temple**: The Pashupatinath Temple is one of the most significant Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, located in Kathmandu, Nepal. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a major pilgrimage spot. However, it is not known for having a huge waterfall within its premises.

2. **Waterfall and Shiva Linga**: While there are many temples and natural sites in India and Nepal where water flows over a Shiva Linga, the specific combination of a huge waterfall directly falling onto a Shiva Linga is not a known feature of the Pashupatinath Temple.

Given these points, the claim that the video shows water from a huge waterfall falling onto a Shiva Linga at the Pashupatinath Temple in Nepal is not supported by known facts about the temple.

1. **Source Verification**: Check the credibility of the source sharing the video. Reliable news outlets or medical professionals would provide more trustworthy information.
2. **Medical Explanation**: Understand if there are any medical phenomena that could explain such an event, such as Lazarus syndrome (a rare phenomenon where circulation spontaneously returns after failed attempts at resuscitation).
3. **Context and Evidence**: Analyze the video for any signs of manipulation or context that might suggest it is staged or misinterpreted.

Given the extraordinary nature of the claim, it is highly likely to be false unless supported by strong, verifiable evidence from credible sources.

1. **Check News Reports**: Look for credible news articles from well-known media outlets that report on this incident. Verify if there are any details about the event, including the location, the victim, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.

2. **Official Statements**: Check for any statements from local authorities, police, or government officials in Madhya Pradesh regarding this incident. Official statements can provide verified information and context.

3. **Fact-Checking Organizations**: Refer to fact-checking websites like Snopes, FactCheck.org, or local fact-checking organizations in India. These organizations often investigate viral claims and provide detailed analyses.

4. **Context and Background**: Understand the broader context of religious tensions or incidents in the region. This can help in assessing the plausibility of the claim.

Without access to real-time data and the ability to verify the claim through the steps mentioned above, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, there have been instances of religious tensions in various parts of India, but specific incidents need to be verified individually.

1. **Context Verification**: 
   - If there is a specific event or image being referred to, it is important to check credible news sources or official statements to understand the context.
   - Public figures like Prime Minister Narendra Modi often participate in various cultural, religious, and social events where gestures of respect, such as bowing, are common.

2. **Image/Video Verification**:
   - If the claim is based on an image or video, it is crucial to verify its authenticity. This can be done through reverse image searches or checking reliable news outlets to see if the image/video has been reported accurately.

3. **Fact-Checking Sources**:
   - Consulting fact-checking websites like Snopes, FactCheck.org, or similar platforms can provide insights into whether the claim has been investigated and what the findings were.

1. **Background**: The Galwan Valley has been a point of contention between India and China, particularly highlighted during the 2020 border clashes. Both countries have been involved in infrastructure development in the region to strengthen their strategic positions.

2. **Indian Infrastructure Development**: India has indeed been working on infrastructure projects in the region, including roads and bridges, to improve connectivity and logistical support for its troops.

1. **Context**: Sukhbir Badal is a prominent political figure in Punjab, and Ram Rahim is a controversial religious leader. The act of presenting a robe could be seen as a gesture of goodwill or an attempt to gain favor with Ram Rahim's followers.

2. **Perspectives**:
   - **Supporters' View**: Supporters of Sukhbir Badal might argue that engaging with influential figures like Ram Rahim could help in maintaining social harmony and garnering support from his followers, which could be seen as beneficial for the welfare of Punjab.
   - **Critics' View**: Critics might argue that associating with a controversial figure like Ram Rahim, who has been convicted of serious crimes, undermines ethical standards and could harm the social fabric of Punjab.

3. **Public Perception**: The public perception of whether this act was for the welfare of Punjab can vary widely. Some may see it as a pragmatic political move, while others may view it as morally and ethically questionable.

Given these considerations, the claim can be seen as subjective and dependent on one's perspective. However, without concrete evidence that this act directly contributed to the welfare of Punjab, it is difficult to fully endorse the claim.

The claim states that the picture of a burning truck is from a riot that took place in Bengaluru on August 11.

1. **Event Verification**: There was indeed a riot in Bengaluru on August 11, 2020, which was triggered by a social media post that led to violence, arson, and clashes with the police.

2. **Image Verification**: To confirm if the specific picture of the burning truck is from this event, we would need to cross-reference the image with credible news sources, eyewitness accounts, or official reports from that date and location.

Without the ability to visually verify the image directly, we rely on the context provided and known facts about the event. Given that the event did occur and involved arson, it is plausible that a burning truck could be part of the scene.

Claims like these can often be misleading or taken out of context. 

1. **Check the Source**: Look for the original source of the image. Reliable news outlets or official statements from CPI-M can provide context.
2. **Image Verification**: Use reverse image search tools to see where else the image has appeared and in what context.
3. **Contextual Information**: Understand the event or protest during which the image was taken. Sometimes placards can be misinterpreted or misrepresented.

Without specific evidence or context, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the information provided and the potential for misinformation, the claim seems dubious.

1. **Context and Source Verification**: The origin of the picture should be verified through reliable sources. This includes checking the metadata of the image, if available, or finding the original source that published the image.

2. **Cultural and Geographical Indicators**: Look for any cultural, architectural, or geographical indicators in the picture that can be associated with India. This might include specific styles of clothing, types of buildings, or other recognizable landmarks.

3. **Cross-Referencing**: Compare the image with other verified images of Muslims praying in India to see if there are similarities.

Without the actual image to analyze, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if the image has been widely recognized and verified by credible sources as being from India, then the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if there is no verification or if the image has been identified as being from another location, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific details and the need for verification, I cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim based solely on the text provided.

This involves checking credible news sources, official statements from Delhi Metro authorities, and any other relevant information that can confirm or refute the claim.

1. **Check News Reports**: Look for any news articles or reports that mention an incident of a woman being assaulted in an elevator within the Delhi Metro system.
2. **Official Statements**: Verify if there are any statements from Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) or local authorities confirming or denying the incident.
3. **Video Analysis**: Examine the video for any identifiable features that can link it to the Delhi Metro, such as signage, uniforms, or other distinct markers.

Without access to real-time data and the ability to conduct a thorough investigation, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there have been no widely reported incidents matching this description in the Delhi Metro system.

This involves checking the context, location, and event details associated with the photo.

1. **Context**: Kanhaiya Kumar is a well-known political figure in India, and he has held public meetings in various locations, including Varanasi.
2. **Location**: Varanasi is a significant city in India, often associated with political events.
3. **Event Details**: If the photo can be cross-referenced with known public meetings of Kanhaiya Kumar in Varanasi, it would support the claim.

Without the actual photo and additional context, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable sources or widely recognized events, we can make an educated assessment.

The Shaheen Bagh protest was a significant event in India, where women, primarily from the Muslim community, led a sit-in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) from December 2019 to March 2020. This protest gained widespread attention and was characterized by its peaceful nature and the participation of a large number of women.

If the video shows the specific location of Shaheen Bagh and features the women's sit-in protest, then the claim can be considered accurate. However, without the ability to view the video directly, we must rely on contextual information and verification from reliable sources.

Assuming the video has been verified by credible sources to be from Shaheen Bagh and depicts the women's sit-in protest, the claim would be:

1. **Verification of Identities**: Identify the couple in the picture and confirm their professions and any public records or news reports about their activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. **Cross-Referencing with Reliable Sources**: Check credible news outlets, official statements, and medical associations for reports on the deaths of Italian doctors due to COVID-19.

Without the actual picture and based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I cannot verify the specific claim about the couple. However, there have been numerous reports of healthcare workers, including doctors in Italy, who have tragically lost their lives while treating COVID-19 patients.

This would involve checking reliable news sources, social media platforms, and fact-checking websites for any reports or confirmations about such an incident in Delhi.

Given the information provided, I cannot definitively verify the claim without further evidence. However, if there are credible sources or verified reports confirming the incident, the claim could be considered 'True'. Conversely, if there are no such reports or if the video is found to be from a different location or context, the claim would be 'False'.

Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur was one of the accused in the 2008 Malegaon bomb blast case. In December 2017, a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court dropped charges against her under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) but did not acquit her of all charges. She was still charged under other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and the Arms Act.

Given this context, the claim that she was acquitted of terrorism charges is not entirely accurate, as she still faces charges under other laws related to the same incident.

सुषमा स्वराज ने कहा कि बालाकोट एयरस्ट्राइक में एक भी आदमी नहीं मरा,mostly false,hi,Sushma Swaraj said that not a single person died in the Balakot airstrike.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Sushma Swaraj said that not a single person died in the Balakot airstrike,"" we need to look at the context and the exact statements made by Sushma Swaraj, who was the Indian Minister of External Affairs at the time of the Balakot airstrike.

The Balakot airstrike occurred on February 26, 2019, when the Indian Air Force conducted airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) training camp in Balakot, Pakistan. The airstrike was in response to the Pulwama attack, where a suicide bomber killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel.

Sushma Swaraj, in a statement made on April 18, 2019, said that the Indian airstrike in Balakot was carried out in a manner that ensured no civilian casualties. She stated, ""Our armed forces were instructed not to harm any Pakistani citizen or its soldier during the strike. Our armed forces were told to target only the terrorist camps of JeM.""

However, this statement does not explicitly say that ""not a single person died."" It emphasizes that the target was terrorist camps and that efforts were made to avoid civilian and military casualties. The claim that ""not a single person died"" is a more absolute statement and is not directly supported by Swaraj's words.

1. Whether Kapil Mishra is indeed considered the mastermind of the Delhi riots.
2. Whether Kapil Mishra has a sister.
3. Whether Kapil Mishra's sister married someone named Molla Shahzad Ali.

Kapil Mishra is a political figure associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India. He has been accused by some of inciting violence during the Delhi riots of 2020, but labeling him as the ""mastermind"" is a contentious and politically charged statement that lacks definitive legal backing.

Regarding the personal life of Kapil Mishra, there is no widely available or verified information confirming that he has a sister who married someone named Molla Shahzad Ali. Personal details about politicians' family members are often not publicly disclosed unless they are also public figures.

Given the lack of verifiable evidence supporting the specific details of the claim, it is prudent to conclude that the claim is not substantiated.

1. **Origin of the Image**: The claim states that the image was created by a Japanese neurologist. However, there is no widely recognized or verified source attributing such an image to a specific Japanese neurologist. Often, such images are circulated on the internet without proper attribution.

2. **Purpose of the Image**: The claim suggests that the image helps in understanding mental stress. While certain optical illusions and images can be used in psychological studies to understand perception and cognitive processes, there is no specific evidence that a particular image created by a Japanese neurologist is used for understanding mental stress.

3. **Scientific Backing**: For an image to be scientifically validated as a tool for understanding mental stress, it would need to be part of peer-reviewed research or widely accepted in the scientific community. There is no such evidence supporting this claim.

Given the lack of verifiable evidence and the general nature of the claim, it appears to be more of an internet myth rather than a fact.

Octopuses are known to exhibit a behavior called ""walking"" using their arms, and they can sometimes be seen moving along the shoreline or in shallow waters.

Given that octopuses can indeed walk along the edge of the sea, the claim is plausible. However, without specific details about the video in question, we cannot verify the exact content of the video. Assuming the video accurately depicts an octopus walking along the edge of the sea, the claim would be accurate.

1. **Verification of Incident**: Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi, has been attacked in the past. For instance, in 2019, he was slapped during a roadshow.
2. **Public Release of Image**: After such incidents, it is common for media outlets to report on the event and sometimes release images or videos of the attacker.
3. **Reliable Sources**: We need to check if credible news organizations or official statements have confirmed the identity and shown the picture of the attacker.

Medical and cloth masks are designed to be breathable and do not significantly restrict oxygen flow or cause carbon dioxide buildup. Numerous studies have shown that wearing masks, even for extended periods, does not lead to hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) or hypercapnia (carbon dioxide buildup). Healthcare workers, who often wear masks for long shifts, do not experience these issues.

However, some people might feel discomfort, fatigue, or a sense of breathlessness due to the physical sensation of wearing a mask, but these are not the same as actual hypoxia or oxygen deficiency. 

Therefore, the claim is exaggerated and not supported by scientific evidence.

2. **Official Statements**: Verify if there are any statements from the police or the BJP regarding the incident.
3. **Contextual Information**: Understand the context of the incident, including the political climate and any recent events related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and NPR (National Population Register).

Based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2021, I do not have specific details about this incident. However, if such an event were widely reported, it would likely be covered by major news outlets.

**Steps to Verify:**
- Search for news articles from credible sources.
- Look for any official statements or press releases.
- Check social media for any verified posts or videos related to the incident.

Without specific evidence or reports confirming the incident, it is not possible to definitively classify the claim. Therefore, based on the lack of verifiable information:

1. **""May God grant eternal peace to the innocent and helpless pregnant elephant and the soul of her unborn baby""**: This part is a wish or a prayer, which is subjective and cannot be fact-checked for truthfulness. It expresses a sentiment rather than a factual statement.

2. **""Om Shanti""**: This is a common Hindu phrase meaning ""peace"" and is often used in prayers and condolences. It is a factual statement about the phrase itself.

Since the claim is primarily a prayer or wish and not a factual statement that can be verified or falsified, it does not fall into the categories of 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' in the context of factual accuracy.

If the woman in the video has been confirmed by credible sources to be Ranu Mondal, then the claim would be 'True'. If there is no confirmation or if the woman has been identified as someone else, the claim would be 'False'. If the information is partially correct or there is some ambiguity, the claim could fall into one of the intermediate categories like 'Mostly True', 'Half True', or 'Mostly False'.

Given that I do not have access to real-time data or the specific video in question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to verify it:

1. **Check Official Announcements**: Look for any official statements or press releases from the Maharashtra government or Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray regarding a lockdown during the specified period.
2. **News Reports**: Review credible news sources to see if they have reported on such an announcement.
3. **Context and Timing**: Consider the context and timing of the claim. For example, if the claim is being evaluated after the specified dates, it would be easier to verify its accuracy.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, there was no record of a lockdown in Maharashtra specifically from June 15 to September 30 announced by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. However, the situation with COVID-19 and related restrictions has been dynamic, and new measures could have been implemented after my last update.

1. ""Along with the SP, several police officers were shot by Vikas Dubey"":
   - Vikas Dubey was a notorious criminal in India.
   - On July 3, 2020, during a police raid in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, Vikas Dubey and his associates ambushed the police team, resulting in the death of eight police officers, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), which is equivalent to the rank of SP (Superintendent of Police) in some contexts.

2. ""who works with almost all parties"":
   - Vikas Dubey had a history of political connections and was known to have associations with various political figures over the years. However, the claim that he worked with ""almost all parties"" is broad and lacks specific evidence to support the extent of his political affiliations.

Given the information available:

- The first part of the claim about the shooting of police officers, including a high-ranking officer, is accurate.
- The second part about his political connections is more ambiguous and generalized.

1. **Incidents and Reports**: There have been documented cases where individuals have been injured or even killed due to electrical faults while using phones that are plugged in for charging. These incidents are often due to faulty chargers, damaged cables, or using non-standard accessories.

2. **Verification**: Specific cases have been reported in various parts of the world, but they are relatively rare. The claim is plausible but not universally true for all situations.

3. **General Safety Advice**: It is generally advised to use original or certified chargers and cables and to avoid using phones while they are charging, especially if the charger or cable appears damaged.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the video has been shared by official Indian Army channels or reputable news outlets.
2. **Context Analysis**: Look for any identifying features in the video, such as uniforms, equipment, or insignia that are specific to the Indian Army.
3. **Cross-Referencing**: Compare the video with other known footage or images of the Indian Army building bridges to see if there are similarities.

Without access to the video and the ability to perform these checks, I cannot definitively verify the claim.

1. **Presence of Camera Crew**: It is a fact that a camera crew was present during PM Modi's beach cleaning activity. This is well-documented and widely reported in the media.

2. **Interpretation of 'Photo-op'**: The term 'photo-op' implies that the activity was staged primarily for the purpose of being photographed or filmed, often to create a positive public image rather than for the intrinsic value of the activity itself.

3. **Intent and Perception**: While the presence of a camera crew can suggest that the activity was intended to be publicized, it does not necessarily mean that the sole or primary purpose was for a photo opportunity. Public figures often have their activities documented for transparency, public engagement, and to inspire others.

Given these points, the claim that the presence of a camera crew ""suggests"" it is a 'photo-op' is an interpretation that can be seen as partially valid but not definitively conclusive. It leans towards suggesting a photo-op but does not provide full evidence of intent.

1. **Context**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, various countries, including China, implemented strict measures to control the spread of the virus. This included tracking and isolating confirmed cases and enforcing quarantine measures.

2. **Verification**: There have been reports and videos circulating on social media showing police and health officials in China apprehending individuals who were either confirmed COVID-19 patients or suspected of being infected, especially during the height of the pandemic. These actions were part of the broader public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

3. **Specificity**: The claim does not provide specific details such as the date, location, or the circumstances under which the patient was caught. However, given the general context of China's stringent measures, it is plausible that such an incident could have occurred.

Based on the context and the plausibility of the scenario given China's strict COVID-19 control measures, the claim seems credible but lacks specific details for full verification.

1. Whether a Gujarat minister's son was indeed arrested.
2. Whether Sunita Yadav, referred to as the ""country's brave daughter,"" resigned.
3. Whether her resignation was not accepted.

Without specific dates or additional context, it is challenging to verify the exact details. However, based on available information up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there was an incident in July 2020 involving Sunita Yadav, a police constable in Gujarat, who confronted the son of a Gujarat minister for violating lockdown rules. Following the incident, there were reports of her resignation, but it was not immediately clear if her resignation was accepted or not.

Given this context:

1. The Gujarat minister's son was involved in an incident and faced legal consequences.
2. Sunita Yadav did tender her resignation.
3. There were conflicting reports about the acceptance of her resignation.

Based on this information, the claim appears to be a mix of accurate and potentially outdated or incomplete information.

2. **Reports**: There have been multiple reports of police action against protesters in Assam. However, the nature and extent of these actions can vary widely.
3. **Credibility**: For a claim to be verified as true, it should be supported by credible sources such as news agencies, human rights organizations, or official investigations.

Without specific, verified evidence directly supporting the claim that male police officers are specifically committing atrocities against women protesters, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim as 'True'.

1. **RSS Background**: The RSS is a Hindu nationalist organization based in India. It is not a government or military body, and it does not typically engage in ceremonial activities involving foreign dignitaries or royalty.

2. **Guard of Honor**: A 'Guard of Honor' is a ceremonial practice usually performed by military or police forces to honor a dignitary. It is not a function typically associated with a non-governmental organization like the RSS.

3. **Queen Elizabeth**: As the Queen of the United Kingdom, any official ceremonial honors involving her would typically be conducted by official state or military bodies, not by foreign non-governmental organizations.

Given these points, it is highly unlikely that the RSS, a non-governmental organization in India, would be involved in giving a 'Guard of Honor' to Queen Elizabeth.

1. Whether Pakistan's flag has been used to taunt India for 70 years.
2. Whether India's flags were waved in a rally in Karachi recently.

1. The claim that Pakistan's flag has been used to taunt India for 70 years is a subjective statement and can be interpreted in various ways. It is true that there have been instances of flag-waving and other symbolic gestures used in the context of the India-Pakistan rivalry, but this is not a verifiable fact in a strict sense.

2. To verify if India's flags were waved in a rally in Karachi, we need to look for credible news sources or evidence that confirms this event. As of the latest information available, there have been no widely reported or verified instances of India's flags being waved in a rally in Karachi.

न्यूजीलैंड में भारतीय संस्कृति की महिमा।,false,gu,The glory of Indian culture in New Zealand.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The glory of Indian culture in New Zealand,"" we need to consider the presence and influence of Indian culture in New Zealand.

1. **Indian Community in New Zealand**: The Indian community is one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups in New Zealand. According to the 2018 Census, people of Indian ethnicity make up a significant portion of the population.

2. **Cultural Celebrations**: Indian festivals such as Diwali and Holi are celebrated with enthusiasm in New Zealand, often with large public events that attract people from various communities.

3. **Cultural Institutions**: There are numerous Indian cultural organizations, temples, and community centers across New Zealand that promote Indian traditions, arts, and languages.

4. **Cuisine and Media**: Indian cuisine is popular and widely available in New Zealand. Additionally, Indian films and music have a presence in the local media.

5. **Recognition and Integration**: The New Zealand government and local councils often support and recognize Indian cultural events, indicating a level of integration and appreciation.

Given these points, Indian culture does have a notable and celebrated presence in New Zealand, but the term ""glory"" is somewhat subjective and can be interpreted in various ways. However, the overall influence and recognition of Indian culture in New Zealand are significant.

दिल्ली में आम आदमी पार्टी की रैली में पैसे देकर दिहाड़ी मजदूरों को लाया गया.,half true,hi,Day laborers were brought to the Aam Aadmi Party rally in Delhi by paying them money.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Day laborers were brought to the Aam Aadmi Party rally in Delhi by paying them money,"" we need to consider the available evidence and context.

1. **Sources and Evidence**: 
   - If there are credible reports, investigations, or admissions from reliable sources (e.g., news organizations, whistleblowers, or party officials) confirming that day laborers were indeed paid to attend the rally, this would support the claim.
   - Conversely, if there are denials from the party and no substantial evidence to support the claim, it would weaken the assertion.

2. **Context and Precedents**:
   - Political rallies often involve logistical arrangements, and sometimes allegations of paid attendance surface. The context of such practices in Indian politics might provide additional insight.

3. **Verification**:
   - Cross-referencing multiple independent sources can help verify the claim. If the claim is widely reported and corroborated by different entities, it gains credibility.

Given the need for specific evidence to make a definitive judgment, and assuming no concrete evidence is provided in the query itself, the claim remains unverified.

Since I cannot view images, I cannot directly assess the claim.

However, I can guide you on how to evaluate it:

1. **Identify the Picture**: Check if the picture is labeled or described as a model image of Babri Hospital.
2. **Source Verification**: Verify the source of the image. Is it from an official or credible source that confirms it is a model image of Babri Hospital?
3. **Cross-Reference**: Compare the image with known images or models of Babri Hospital to see if they match.

Without the ability to view the image, I cannot definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim.

1. **Collapse of Yes Bank**: Yes Bank did face a financial crisis in March 2020, leading to a temporary moratorium and restructuring by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, it did not completely collapse; it was restructured and continues to operate.

2. **Number of Employees Losing Jobs**: There is no verified information or credible source that confirms 18,238 employees lost their jobs due to the crisis at Yes Bank. 

3. **Religious Composition of Employees**: Employment data based on religious composition is typically not publicly disclosed by private companies like Yes Bank. Therefore, there is no verifiable source to confirm that 17,000 out of 18,238 employees are Hindus.

Given the lack of verifiable evidence for both the number of job losses and the religious composition of the employees, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated and misleading.

2. **Event Verification**: Confirm if there was an actual attack on Hindus' Ramleela in Punjab.
3. **Source Verification**: Evaluate the credibility of the sources providing this information.

Without specific details or evidence to verify these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if there is no credible evidence supporting the claim, it would be considered false.

Due to this waterfall, mist is created here, which is why this waterfall is called Dhuandhar Falls.","The claim contains both factual information and cultural beliefs. Let's break it down:

1. **Cultural Beliefs**: The statement about bathing in the Ganges, sipping the waters of the Yamuna, and seeing the Narmada washing away sins is a cultural and religious belief in Hinduism. This is not a factual claim that can be verified scientifically, but it is a widely held belief in Indian culture.

2. **Geographical Information**: The description of Dhuandhar Falls being located 25 kilometers from Jabalpur city in Madhya Pradesh and the mist created by the waterfall is factual. Dhuandhar Falls is indeed a well-known waterfall in this region, and the name ""Dhuandhar"" comes from the Hindi words ""Dhuan"" (smoke) and ""Dhar"" (flow), referring to the mist created by the waterfall.

Given that the geographical information is accurate and the cultural beliefs are correctly represented as beliefs, the claim can be considered mostly true.

2. **Official Statements**: Look for any official statements or denials from BJP or JDU regarding this claim.
3. **Context and Evidence**: Assess if there is any concrete evidence, such as videos, eyewitness accounts, or investigative reports, that support the claim.

The year 1063 AD falls within the medieval period, and many significant structures were indeed built during this time. For example, the construction of the Basilica di San Marco in Venice began in 1063 AD.

Given that there are well-documented structures from that era, the claim that ""No one will believe that it was built centuries ago in 1063 AD"" is not accurate. People familiar with history and architecture would indeed believe that a structure could have been built in 1063 AD.

S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, a renowned Indian playback singer, passed away on September 25, 2020. There were no widely reported or credible sources indicating that his family was unable to pay the hospital bill. Additionally, there were no verified reports that the Tamil Nadu government refused assistance or that the central government stepped in to provide financial help.

1. **Gujarat Model**: The term ""Gujarat model"" generally refers to the economic and developmental policies implemented in the state of Gujarat, India, particularly during the tenure of Narendra Modi as Chief Minister. It is often cited in discussions about economic growth, industrialization, and infrastructure development.

2. **Extortion by Railway Police**: The claim specifically mentions extortion by the Gujarat Railway Police. To verify this, we would need credible reports or evidence indicating that such extortion is a widespread and recognized issue.

3. **Verification**: Without specific and credible sources or reports confirming that workers are being extorted weekly by the Gujarat Railway Police, it is difficult to substantiate this claim. General allegations on social media or isolated incidents do not provide sufficient evidence to label the claim as true.

Given the lack of concrete evidence or widespread reporting on this specific issue, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated.

1. **Context**: There have been documented skirmishes between Chinese and Indian soldiers, particularly in the Galwan Valley in June 2020. These incidents have been reported by multiple credible news sources.

2. **Verification**: The authenticity of the video must be verified through reliable sources. If the video has been confirmed by credible news agencies or official statements from either government, it would lend credibility to the claim.

3. **Misleading Content**: Sometimes videos can be misrepresented or taken out of context. It is important to ensure that the video is indeed from the incident in question and not from a different event or time.

श्रीलंकेच्या पंतप्रधानांसोबत बैठकीत तत्कालीन पंतप्रधान मनमोहन सिंह यांच्या एेवजी सोनिया गांधी खुर्चीत बसल्या होत्या,half true,mr,Sonia Gandhi was seated in the chair instead of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a meeting with the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Sonia Gandhi was seated in the chair instead of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a meeting with the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka,"" we need to consider the context and available evidence.

Sonia Gandhi, as the President of the Indian National Congress, held significant influence in Indian politics, especially during the tenure of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. However, protocol and diplomatic norms typically dictate that the Prime Minister or an official representative of the government would be the primary person to meet with foreign dignitaries, such as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.

There have been instances where Sonia Gandhi, due to her prominent political role, was present at high-level meetings, but it is highly unusual and against protocol for her to replace the Prime Minister in such a formal diplomatic setting.

Given the lack of credible evidence supporting the specific claim that Sonia Gandhi was seated in the chair instead of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a meeting with the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, and considering the standard diplomatic protocols, the claim appears to be unfounded.

1. **Generalization**: The statement uses the term ""every person,"" which is an absolute generalization. It is highly unlikely that every single person in a country, especially one as populous and diverse as India, holds the same opinion.

2. **Comparisons to Hitler**: While some individuals and groups may have compared Prime Minister Modi to Hitler, it is not accurate to say that this is a universal sentiment shared by all citizens.

3. **Context and Evidence**: There is no concrete evidence or survey data to support the claim that every person in the country is making this comparison.

Given these points, the claim is an overgeneralization and lacks factual support.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there are any official announcements or credible news reports confirming that the government has decided to reduce pensions by up to 30 percent.
2. **Context and Specifics**: Understand the context in which the reduction is being made. Is it a proposal, a confirmed policy, or a misinterpretation of another financial adjustment?
3. **Scope and Applicability**: Determine if the reduction applies to all employees or only a specific group, and whether the ""up to 30 percent"" figure is accurate.

Without specific details or evidence to support the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if there is no credible information or official confirmation, the claim would likely be considered false.

1. Whether the meeting was indeed staged.
2. Whether the woman seen in the picture was later seen leaving in a car.

Without specific evidence or reliable sources to confirm these points, it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim. However, if there is no substantial evidence to support the claim that the meeting was staged or that the woman was not a genuine migrant worker, the claim would be considered speculative.

1. **Verify the Incident**: Check if there was a recent or notable incident involving Indian and Chinese troops where soldiers were injured.
2. **Identify the Soldier**: Confirm if there is an Indian soldier named Surendra Singh who was reported to be injured in such an incident.
3. **Match the Picture**: Ensure that the picture in question is indeed of Surendra Singh and that it corresponds to the reported incident.

Without access to the specific picture and additional context, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if the claim has been widely reported and verified by credible news sources, it would lean towards being true.

There is no credible evidence to support the idea that Donald Trump intended to weaponize the coronavirus against Americans. While there has been significant criticism of his administration's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including accusations of mismanagement and downplaying the severity of the virus, these criticisms do not equate to an intention to weaponize the virus.

Additionally, while there have been protests related to various aspects of the pandemic response, these protests are generally about issues such as lockdown measures, mask mandates, and vaccine requirements, rather than a belief that the virus was intentionally weaponized by the President.

The aircraft referred to is likely the custom Boeing 777-300ER, which has been modified for use by the Prime Minister and other high-ranking officials of India. The cost associated with these aircraft includes the purchase price, modifications, and security upgrades.

Reports indicate that the total cost for the two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, including modifications and security features, is approximately ₹8,400 crore (around $1.1 billion USD). This figure is close to the ₹8,600 crore mentioned in the claim, but not exact.

The claim that ""The law of this country is only for poor people"" is an overgeneralization and not accurate. While it is true that there can be disparities in how laws are applied and enforced, often influenced by socioeconomic status, the legal system is designed to apply to all individuals regardless of their wealth. There are mechanisms in place, such as public defenders and legal aid organizations, to help ensure that even those with limited financial resources have access to legal representation. However, the effectiveness and fairness of these mechanisms can vary, leading to perceptions and instances of inequality. Nonetheless, the statement as it stands is not accurate in its absolute form.",false,True,False

1. **Context Verification**: Priyanka Gandhi, a prominent Indian politician, did indeed make arrangements for buses to help migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the exact number of buses and the specific details of the arrangement need to be verified.

2. **Image Verification**: Viral images can often be misleading or taken out of context. It is important to check if the image in question is actually from the event organized by Priyanka Gandhi or if it has been misattributed.

3. **Fact-Checking Sources**: Reliable fact-checking organizations and news reports should be consulted to confirm the details of the event and the authenticity of the image.

Based on available information and fact-checking sources, it has been found that while Priyanka Gandhi did arrange buses for migrant workers, the viral image in question has been misattributed or exaggerated in some cases. The number of buses and the specific details often do not match the claims made in the viral posts.

Thanks, PM.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""India's first animal bridges on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway are designed to protect animals from getting hit,"" we need to verify a few key points:

1. **Existence of Animal Bridges on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway**: It is true that the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway project includes provisions for wildlife crossings, including animal bridges and underpasses, to ensure safe passage for animals and reduce the risk of vehicle-animal collisions.

2. **First of Its Kind in India**: While the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is one of the most high-profile projects to include such wildlife crossings, it is not necessarily the first instance of animal bridges in India. Other projects, such as the underpasses in the Pench Tiger Reserve on NH44, have also been implemented to protect wildlife.

3. **Purpose of the Bridges**: The primary purpose of these animal bridges is indeed to protect animals from getting hit by vehicles, ensuring their safe passage across the expressway.

Given these points, the claim is mostly accurate but not entirely precise in stating that these are the ""first"" animal bridges in India.

One picture is labeled 'Ganga during Congress rule' and the other 'Ganga during Modi rule'.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a Facebook page has posted two pictures of the Ganges river along with Priyanka Gandhi, labeled 'Ganga during Congress rule' and 'Ganga during Modi rule', we need to verify the following:

1. Whether such a post exists on Facebook.
2. Whether the pictures accurately represent the Ganges river during the respective periods of Congress rule and Modi rule.
3. Whether Priyanka Gandhi is indeed featured in the pictures.

Without access to the specific Facebook post and the ability to verify the authenticity and context of the images, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, such posts are often created to make political statements and may not always be accurate or representative of the actual conditions of the Ganges river during the respective periods.

1. **Background Information**: Bhutan and India share a long-standing relationship, and water sharing has been part of their cooperation, especially in border areas like Assam.

2. **Recent Developments**: There have been reports in the past about temporary disruptions in water flow from Bhutan to Assam, often due to maintenance work or natural causes like landslides. However, these disruptions are usually temporary and not indicative of a permanent cessation of water supply.

3. **Official Statements**: As of the latest available information, there has been no official statement from either the Bhutanese or Indian government indicating a permanent stop in water supply for irrigation purposes.

4. **Media Reports**: Some media outlets have reported on temporary issues, but these are often resolved through bilateral discussions and cooperation.

Based on the available information, the claim that Bhutan has permanently stopped providing water to Indian farmers in Assam for irrigation is not supported by credible evidence.

1. **Verification of Sources**: Check reliable news sources, official statements from health organizations, and fact-checking websites to confirm the identities and causes of death of the individuals in the pictures.
2. **Contextual Accuracy**: Ensure that the images are not misattributed or taken out of context. Sometimes, images of living individuals or those who died from other causes might be mistakenly or intentionally used.

Given the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2021, there have been numerous reports and tributes to healthcare workers in Italy who have died due to COVID-19. However, without specific images to verify, it's challenging to confirm the exact claim.

**Fact-Checking Example**:
- **True**: If the images are verified to be of healthcare workers who died due to COVID-19 in Italy.
- **False**: If the images are found to be of individuals who did not die from COVID-19, are not healthcare workers, or are from a different country.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the general information and the need for specific verification of the images, the claim can be considered **Mostly True** if the majority of the images are verified correctly, but there might be a small chance of misattribution.

1. **Context Verification**: The Farm Ordinance Bill, which later became the Farm Laws, was passed in September 2020. If the picture is indeed from this period, it would support the claim.

However, saying waterlogging occurs ""everywhere"" is an exaggeration, as not every single area may be affected equally.

2. **Water accumulation at the sea link**: The Bandra-Worli Sea Link is a major infrastructure project in Mumbai. While heavy rains can cause water accumulation on roads and other infrastructure, the sea link is designed with drainage systems to handle rainwater. However, there have been instances where heavy rains have led to temporary water accumulation on the sea link.

1. **Context of the Picture**: The claim is based on a specific picture, but without seeing the picture, it's challenging to verify its content and context. The picture could be selectively highlighting certain aspects of development or underdevelopment.

2. **Development Metrics**: Nitish Kumar has been the Chief Minister of Bihar for multiple terms, starting from 2005. During his tenure, there have been various reports and metrics indicating both progress and ongoing challenges in the state. For example, improvements in infrastructure, education, and law and order have been noted, but Bihar still faces significant issues in poverty, healthcare, and overall economic development.

3. **Subjectivity**: The term ""development"" can be subjective and may vary based on different perspectives. What one person sees as development, another might see as insufficient progress.

Given these considerations, without specific details about the picture and a comprehensive analysis of Bihar's development over the 15 years, the claim cannot be fully validated or refuted. However, acknowledging that there have been both advancements and ongoing challenges under Nitish Kumar's rule, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not entirely conclusive.

2. **Cause of Death**: Verify from credible sources if Dr. Ayesha died due to the coronavirus.

Without specific evidence or reliable sources confirming both the identity and the cause of death, we cannot consider the claim to be true.

If the picture in question is an officially released or widely recognized architectural rendering or model of the Ram Temple, then the claim would be accurate. However, if the picture is not verified or is a speculative or unofficial representation, the claim would be less accurate.

Given that I do not have access to the specific picture being referred to, I can only provide a general assessment based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023. Official designs and models of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya have been publicly released and are available in various media.

This involves checking reliable sources, news reports, and any available metadata associated with the images.

1. **Context Verification**: Research if there have been documented instances of police brutality in Kashmir during Eid. This can be done by looking at credible news sources, human rights reports, and official statements.

2. **Image Verification**: Use reverse image search tools to see if the pictures have been used in other contexts or if they have been misattributed. This can help determine if the images are indeed from Kashmir and during Eid.

3. **Cross-Referencing**: Compare the images with other verified images from the same event or location to check for consistency.

Without access to the specific images and the ability to perform these checks, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to how such a claim should be evaluated.

Given the need for thorough verification and the potential for images to be misattributed or taken out of context, it is prudent to be cautious.

Without access to specific data or sources, I cannot definitively confirm or refute the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on a specific event that has been reported in the news, it is possible that such an event did take place after a long hiatus. Given the context of Srinagar, which has experienced significant political and social changes over the past few decades, it is plausible that certain cultural or religious events might have been disrupted and then resumed after a long period.

2. **News Reports**: Search for credible news articles or reports that confirm the virality of her election campaign post.
3. **Fact-Checking Websites**: Refer to established fact-checking websites to see if they have addressed this claim.

1. **Shri Ram's city Ayodhya**: Ayodhya is indeed traditionally considered the birthplace and city of Lord Shri Ram, a major deity in Hinduism. This part of the claim is true.

2. **The decoration of Ayodhya**: This part of the claim is more ambiguous. If it refers to the general practice of decorating Ayodhya, especially during festivals like Diwali or Ram Navami, it is true that the city is often decorated elaborately. However, if it refers to a specific event or time period, more context would be needed to verify its accuracy.

Given the general nature of the claim and the cultural practices associated with Ayodhya, the statement can be considered largely accurate but somewhat lacking in specific details.

Without access to these verification tools and sources, I cannot definitively confirm the claim. However, if we assume that the picture has been verified by credible sources to be from Jind, Haryana, and related to the farmers' protest, the claim would be 'True'.

Without access to specific sources or direct evidence, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a verifiable statement made by Bhagwant Mann, then the accuracy would depend on the context and exact wording of his statement.

1. **Research**: Conduct a search for news articles, videos, or credible reports that document this specific incident.
2. **Verification**: Check multiple sources to ensure the information is consistent and reliable.

Based on available information, if there are credible reports or visual evidence confirming that Motilal Vora did indeed touch Rahul Gandhi's feet, the claim would be considered 'True'. If there is no evidence or if the reports are inconsistent, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the nature of this task, I will proceed with the assumption that the necessary research has been conducted and the evidence has been reviewed.

**Hypothetical Scenario**:
- If credible sources such as major news outlets or verified videos confirm the incident, the claim is 'True'.
- If there are no credible sources or evidence, the claim is 'False'.

1. **America's Atmosphere Filled with Hatred**: This is a subjective statement. While there are certainly instances of division and conflict in America, it is not universally true that the entire atmosphere is filled with hatred. There are also many examples of unity, kindness, and community.

2. **Hugging Video Brings Peace to the Soul**: This is also subjective. A hugging video can indeed bring a sense of peace and comfort to many people, but this effect can vary from person to person.

Given that both parts of the claim are subjective and can vary based on individual perspectives, the claim cannot be definitively categorized as entirely true or false. It contains elements of truth but is also open to interpretation.

असम में एनआरसी लागू होने के बाद पुलिस द्वारा लोगों को उनके घर से निकालने का वीडियो.,false,hi,A video of people being removed from their homes by the police after the implementation of NRC in Assam.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and content of the video in question. The National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam is a register intended to document all the legal citizens of India in the state of Assam. The final NRC list was published on August 31, 2019, and it excluded around 1.9 million people, leading to concerns about their citizenship status.

However, the claim specifically mentions a video showing people being removed from their homes by the police after the implementation of NRC. To verify this, we would need to:

1. Confirm the authenticity of the video.
2. Verify the date and location of the video to ensure it is indeed from Assam and post-NRC implementation.
3. Check credible news sources or official statements to see if there have been documented instances of police removing people from their homes specifically due to the NRC.

Without access to the video and additional context, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on available information, there have been no widespread reports of police forcibly removing people from their homes solely due to the NRC implementation. Most actions related to the NRC involve legal proceedings and detention centers, not immediate police removal from homes.

1. **Definition of Oppression**: Oppression can include a wide range of actions such as political repression, human rights violations, economic exploitation, social discrimination, etc.

2. **Evidence and Reports**: We need to look at credible sources such as reports from human rights organizations, news articles, and academic studies that document instances of oppression in BJP-governed states over the last five years.

3. **Context and Comparisons**: It is also important to compare the situation in BJP-governed states with those governed by other parties to understand if the claim is specific to BJP governance or a broader issue.

4. **Specific Incidents**: Identifying specific incidents or patterns of oppression in BJP-governed states can help substantiate the claim.

India Gate, located in New Delhi, is a war memorial dedicated to the soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in the First World War and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. The names inscribed on India Gate are those of soldiers who lost their lives in these conflicts, not specifically freedom fighters from the Indian independence movement.

Given this context, the claim that Muslims are the majority among the names inscribed on India Gate is not accurate because the names are of soldiers from various backgrounds who served in the British Indian Army, not freedom fighters. Therefore, the claim does not align with the historical purpose and the inscriptions on India Gate.

राहुल गांधी के काफिले को रास्ता देने के लिए एम्बुलेंस को रोका,mostly false,hi,An ambulance was stopped to make way for Rahul Gandhi's convoy.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""An ambulance was stopped to make way for Rahul Gandhi's convoy,"" we need to verify the details from reliable sources. This involves checking news reports, official statements, and any available evidence such as videos or eyewitness accounts.

1. **News Reports**: Look for credible news articles from established media outlets that reported on the incident. Check if they confirm or deny the claim.
2. **Official Statements**: Check for any statements from Rahul Gandhi's office, the police, or other authorities involved in managing the convoy.
3. **Eyewitness Accounts**: Look for any firsthand accounts or videos that might have captured the incident.

Without access to real-time data and verification from these sources, I cannot definitively confirm the claim. However, if we assume that the claim has been widely reported and verified by multiple credible sources, we can make an informed judgment.

Given the nature of the claim, if it has been confirmed by multiple reliable sources, it would be considered 'True'. If there are some discrepancies or lack of complete evidence but still a significant amount of confirmation, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the evidence is mixed or unclear, it could be 'Half True'. If the claim is largely unsubstantiated or refuted by credible sources, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Final Answer: Without specific verification from reliable sources, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the need for verification, I would lean towards 'Half True' pending further evidence.",,False,True

1. **Viagra's Effects**: Viagra (sildenafil) is a medication primarily used to treat erectile dysfunction in humans. Its effects on animals, particularly sheep, are not well-documented in scientific literature. While it does have some vasodilatory effects, there is no evidence to suggest it would cause sheep to become uncontrollable.

2. **Scientific Evidence**: There are no credible scientific studies or reports that support the claim that sheep have become uncontrollable due to drinking water mixed with Viagra.

3. **Source Verification**: This claim appears to be more in line with a sensational or humorous anecdote rather than a factual report. It is important to verify such claims with reliable sources, and in this case, there are none that substantiate it.

Given the lack of evidence and the implausibility of the claim, it can be classified as false.

While it is true that hand sanitizer contains alcohol, which is flammable, the likelihood of it causing a fire just by being left in a car is extremely low. For a fire to start, the sanitizer would need to reach its flash point and have an ignition source. Most hand sanitizers have a flash point around 60-70 degrees Celsius (140-158 degrees Fahrenheit), which is higher than the temperatures typically reached inside a car, even on a hot day.

1. **Nepal's Actions**: There have been instances where Nepal's actions regarding water resources have caused concerns for India. For example, there have been disputes over the Mahakali River and other water-sharing issues.

2. **Bhutan's Actions**: In June 2020, there were reports that Bhutan had stopped the supply of irrigation water to farmers in Assam. However, Bhutan clarified that the disruption was due to technical reasons and not a deliberate act to stop water supply. Bhutan and India have a history of cooperation, and Bhutan has denied any intention to harm Indian interests.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also lacks context and may misrepresent Bhutan's intentions.

1. Whether the monthly pension of former MLAs has indeed been increased from 25,000 to 40,000.
2. Whether this increase was addressed during the monsoon session instead of other important issues.

Without specific details or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is based on factual events, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the pension increase did occur as stated, the first part of the claim is true.
- The second part of the claim is subjective and depends on the context of the monsoon session and what other issues were on the agenda.

Given the lack of specific information to verify both points, the claim can be considered as partially accurate but not fully verifiable.

1. Whether Ravi Shastri is the head coach of the Indian men's cricket team as of August 15th of this year.
2. Whether Ravi Shastri made a tweet on August 15th of this year.
3. Whether the tweet announced the retirement of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma from international cricket.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, Ravi Shastri was the head coach of the Indian men's cricket team, but his tenure was set to end after the T20 World Cup in 2021. Rahul Dravid was appointed as the head coach starting November 2021. Therefore, Ravi Shastri would not be the head coach as of August 15th of this year.

Additionally, there have been no verified reports or announcements about Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma retiring from international cricket as of my last update.

However, based on historical context, there have been documented incidents of migrant workers' protests in Surat, Gujarat, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when many workers were stranded and demanded transportation to return to their home states.

1. **Event Verification**: Confirm if a farmers' assembly occurred in Haryana on September 25th of this year.
2. **Image Verification**: Ensure the image in question corresponds to the event mentioned.

Without access to the image or additional context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the event did take place and the image is from that event, the claim would be 'True'.

1. The video is of Bhushi Dam in Lonavala.
2. If people continue to behave like this, COVID-19 will not go away from India.

For the first part, verifying the location of the video would require visual confirmation or additional context that confirms it is indeed Bhushi Dam in Lonavala. Without this specific verification, we cannot definitively confirm this part of the claim.

For the second part, the statement is a general assertion about public behavior and its impact on the spread of COVID-19. It is widely accepted by health experts that large gatherings and not following COVID-19 safety protocols (like social distancing and wearing masks) can contribute to the spread of the virus. Therefore, the behavior depicted in the video (assuming it shows people not following these protocols) could indeed hinder efforts to control the pandemic.

Given the general nature of the second part and the need for specific verification for the first part, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not fully verifiable without more context.

1. **Context**: The National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) have been contentious issues in India, leading to protests and rallies, particularly among Muslim communities who fear discrimination.

2. **Location**: The claim specifies that the rally took place in Delhi. Verification would require checking if the video indeed shows recognizable landmarks or other indicators that confirm it was shot in Delhi.

3. **Participants**: The claim states that the rally was by Muslims. This can be verified by observing the participants, their placards, and any slogans or speeches that might indicate the demographic and their stance on NPR and NRC.

Without the actual video to analyze, we can only hypothesize based on known facts and previous occurrences. However, there have been documented rallies in Delhi against NPR and NRC involving Muslim communities.

Rajnath Singh is India's Defense Minister, a high-ranking official responsible for the country's defense policies and military operations. It is highly unlikely that a person in such a position would engage in superstitious practices like tying lemons and green chilies at the border to ward off attacks, especially in an official capacity.

1. **Google's Mapping Policies**: Google often customizes its maps based on the local laws and geopolitical sensitivities of different regions. For example, the depiction of borders and disputed areas can vary depending on the country from which the map is being accessed.

2. **Line of Control (LoC)**: The Line of Control is a military control line between the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is not an internationally recognized boundary but serves as the de facto border.

3. **Recent Changes**: There have been no widely reported or verified changes by Google that indicate the complete removal of the Line of Control from its maps. Google Maps typically shows the LoC, but the representation can differ based on the user's location.

Given the above points, the claim that ""Google has removed the Line of Control from the Indian map"" is not supported by substantial evidence and is likely based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of how Google represents disputed borders.

1. **Official Announcements**: Check if there has been any official announcement or legal directive from the central government regarding this matter.
2. **Freedom of Speech**: Consider the implications on freedom of speech and whether such a directive would align with constitutional rights.
3. **Fact-Checking Sources**: Look for reliable fact-checking sources or news reports that have addressed this claim.

As of the latest information available, there has been no official directive from the central government that categorically bans individuals from sharing posts related to the coronavirus. While there have been efforts to curb misinformation and ensure that accurate information is disseminated, these measures do not equate to a blanket ban on sharing coronavirus-related posts by individuals.

1. **Historical Context**: We need to verify if there have been any previous instances where a Prime Minister managed the country for 5 years without borrowing from the World Bank.
2. **Current Data**: We need to check if the current Prime Minister has indeed not borrowed any money from the World Bank during their tenure.

Without specific details about the country and the Prime Minister in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is about a specific country and Prime Minister, we would need to look at the financial records and historical data of that country.

Given the lack of specific information and the need for detailed verification, it is difficult to conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim.

1. **Scientific Evidence**: There is no widely accepted scientific evidence or peer-reviewed studies that confirm Unani decoctions can cure COVID-19. The treatment and management of COVID-19 are based on guidelines provided by health authorities like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which do not endorse Unani decoctions as a cure.

2. **Local Reports**: While there may be anecdotal reports or local claims about the effectiveness of Unani decoctions in Malegaon, these do not constitute rigorous scientific evidence. Localized reports can sometimes be influenced by various factors, including reporting biases or lack of comprehensive testing.

3. **New Cases**: The claim that no new cases have been found in Malegaon would need to be verified with official health data. Even if true, it does not necessarily imply causation by the Unani decoction; other factors such as lockdown measures, social distancing, and other public health interventions could play significant roles.

Given the lack of scientific validation and the need for more rigorous evidence to support such a claim, it is important to approach it with skepticism.

2. **Historical and Current Events**: There have been numerous instances of confrontations between Palestinian civilians and Israeli security forces, especially around sensitive sites like the Al-Aqsa Mosque. It is not uncommon for individuals, including young people, to be involved in such confrontations.

3. **Verification**: To verify the claim, we would need specific details about the incident, such as the date, the identity of the girl, and corroborating evidence like photos, videos, or credible news reports.

Without specific details or evidence to verify this particular incident, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given the historical context and the likelihood of such events occurring, the claim could be plausible but not confirmed.

This involves checking reliable news sources, official statements, and any available fact-checking reports.

1. **Check Reliable News Sources**: Look for reports from reputable news organizations that have covered the incident. They often provide verified information and context.
2. **Official Statements**: See if there are any statements from the farmer unions, the BJP, or law enforcement agencies regarding the incident.
3. **Fact-Checking Websites**: Websites like Snopes, FactCheck.org, or local fact-checking organizations may have already investigated the claim.

Without access to these resources in this environment, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to proceed with the verification process.

If you find that:
- Multiple reliable sources confirm that members of farmer unions did indeed beat up a BJP leader, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the incident happened but the details are slightly different (e.g., it wasn't a BJP leader or the context was different), it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.
- If the incident is misrepresented or exaggerated, it could be 'Mostly False'.
- If the incident did not happen at all as described, it would be 'False'.

1. **Amit Shah's Tenure as Home Minister**: Amit Shah became the Home Minister of India on May 30, 2019.
2. **Akbaruddin Owaisi's Statements**: Akbaruddin Owaisi is known for his speeches and statements, but there is no widely reported or verified instance of him specifically pleading for help from Allah in direct response to Amit Shah becoming the Home Minister.

1. **Historical Context**: Israel has been vocally opposed to Iran's nuclear program, citing security concerns. There have been various reports and speculations about Israel's involvement in covert operations to sabotage Iran's nuclear efforts, including cyber-attacks like the Stuxnet virus.

2. **Direct Bombing**: As of the latest information available up to 2023, there is no confirmed public record of Israel directly bombing an Iranian nuclear facility. There have been incidents of sabotage and targeted assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists, which are often attributed to Israel, but no direct bombing has been confirmed.

3. **Iran's Nuclear Program**: Despite various setbacks, Iran continues to pursue its nuclear program. International negotiations and agreements, such as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), have been aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear capabilities, but these efforts have been complex and ongoing.

Given the lack of confirmed evidence of a direct bombing by Israel on an Iranian nuclear facility, the claim appears to be inaccurate.

1. **City Observing a Holiday During Navratri**: It is common for cities in India to observe holidays during Navratri, especially in regions where the festival is widely celebrated. However, this can vary depending on the specific city and local government policies.

2. **Village Remaining Open**: Villages may or may not observe holidays during Navratri. This can depend on local customs, traditions, and the economic activities of the village. Some villages might continue their daily routines, while others might also observe holidays.

Given that the claim makes a general statement about cities and villages without specifying particular locations, it is difficult to definitively categorize it as entirely true or false. However, it is generally more common for cities to have official holidays during major festivals like Navratri, while villages might not have the same level of formal observance.

1. **Universities**: Gujarat has seen the establishment of several new universities in the last two decades. For example, Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (now known as Pandit Deendayal Energy University) was established in 2007, and Gujarat Forensic Sciences University was established in 2008.

2. **Airports**: The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad has seen significant upgrades, and new airports like the Dholera International Airport are under development. Additionally, the Surat Airport has been expanded and modernized.

3. **Metro**: The Ahmedabad Metro project, also known as the Gujarat Metro, has been developed in recent years. The first phase of the Ahmedabad Metro was inaugurated in March 2019.

Given these developments, the claim that no new university, airport, or metro has been built in Gujarat in the last two decades is not accurate.

The primary methods recommended by health authorities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to prevent coronavirus include wearing masks, maintaining physical distance, practicing good hand hygiene, and getting vaccinated.

It is being claimed that the Sikh youth seen in the picture is the freedom fighter Shaheed Bhagat Singh.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider historical context and verify the identities of the individuals in the picture.

1. **Historical Context**: Shaheed Bhagat Singh was a prominent freedom fighter in India who was active in the 1920s and was executed in 1931. Photography from that era was relatively rare and typically black and white.

2. **Visual Evidence**: If the picture in question is in color or shows modern elements (such as contemporary police uniforms, vehicles, or surroundings), it is unlikely to be from the 1920s.

3. **Verification**: Cross-referencing the image with known historical photographs of Bhagat Singh can help verify the claim. Bhagat Singh is often depicted with a turban or a hat, and his facial features are well-documented.

Given these points, it is highly improbable that a modern viral image showing a police officer beating a Sikh youth is of Bhagat Singh, who lived and died in the early 20th century.

2. **News Reports**: Look for credible news articles or reports that confirm or deny the incident.
3. **Contextual Analysis**: Understand the context of the rally and whether there were any reasons or events that might have led to the waving of the Indian tricolor.

1. **Locust Swarm in Vidarbha**: Check if there have been recent reports of locust swarms in the Vidarbha region, specifically in Morshi village, Amravati district.
2. **Viral Video**: Verify if the video in question is indeed from Morshi village and not from another location or an older event.

However, if we assume that the video is being circulated with the claim that it shows a crowd of patients at Sassoon Hospital in Pune, and there is no evidence to support or refute this claim, we can consider the following:

1. **Verification from Reliable Sources**: If credible news outlets or official hospital statements confirm the video's authenticity and context, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
2. **Lack of Evidence**: If there is no supporting evidence or if the video has been debunked by reliable sources, the claim could be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

1. **Kaas Plateau**: Known as the ""Kaas Pathar,"" it is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site located in Maharashtra, India. It is famous for its seasonal wildflower bloom, which typically occurs between August and September.

2. **Impact of Tourists**: The presence of tourists can have an impact on natural sites. High foot traffic can lead to trampling of vegetation, littering, and other disturbances that might affect the natural blooming of flowers.

3. **Lockdown Effects**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns were implemented globally, leading to a significant reduction in human activity in many natural areas. This reduction in human presence could potentially allow natural ecosystems to recover and flourish.

Given these points, the claim that the absence of amateur tourists due to the lockdown has caused the Kaas Plateau to bloom in all directions is plausible. The reduction in human disturbance could indeed have a positive effect on the blooming of flowers.

However, without specific scientific data or studies directly linking the lockdown to an increased bloom on the Kaas Plateau, we cannot definitively say the claim is entirely true. It is reasonable to infer that the absence of tourists could have contributed to a more robust bloom, but this is an inference rather than a confirmed fact.

1. **Standard Procedure**: It is standard procedure for Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) to be placed in strong rooms (secure storage) after voting and before counting. This is done to ensure the security and integrity of the voting process.

2. **Collusion Allegation**: The claim includes an allegation of collusion with the Election Commission. Collusion implies a secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others.

3. **Verification**: There is no publicly available evidence or credible reports to support the claim that the Election Commission is involved in any collusion regarding the placement of EVMs in strong rooms in Madhya Pradesh.

Water management issues can arise due to natural factors like seasonal changes, but these are not the same as intentional blockage by a government.

3. **Verification**: A thorough search of recent news articles, official government releases from both Bhutan and India, and statements from international bodies involved in water management would be necessary to confirm any such action. 

Given the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim and the absence of any significant reports on this matter, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is not accurate.

2. Whether 11 new essential rules have been implemented in Mumbai as a result of this extension.

Without specific and up-to-date information on these points, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim, it seems to be presenting specific details that would typically be verifiable through official government announcements or credible news sources.

1. **Context Verification**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were indeed reports of mass graves being dug in various parts of the world, including Indonesia, due to the high number of deaths. Java, being a densely populated island, faced significant challenges during the pandemic.

2. **Local Authorities' Orders**: There were instances where local authorities in Indonesia took measures to manage the burial of COVID-19 victims, including the digging of multiple graves in anticipation of more deaths.

3. **Visual Evidence**: If the picture in question shows workers digging multiple graves, it could be consistent with the measures taken during the pandemic.

These are not the same as the virus causing COVID-19 in humans.

1. **Source Verification**: Check the credibility of the source that made the claim.
2. **Contextual Evidence**: Look for news reports, official statements, or eyewitness accounts that corroborate the incident.

1. **Hathras Case Background**: The Hathras case refers to a 2020 incident in Uttar Pradesh, India, where a young Dalit woman was allegedly gang-raped and later died from her injuries. The case received widespread media attention and led to significant public outcry.

2. **Naxalite Allegation**: Naxalites are members of communist guerrilla groups in India, often associated with Maoist insurgency. Allegations of someone being a Naxalite are serious and typically involve claims of involvement in armed rebellion or extremist activities.

3. **Congress Worker Allegation**: The Indian National Congress is a major political party in India. Being a Congress worker implies active involvement or membership in the party.

4. **Verification**: To verify the claim, we need credible sources or official statements confirming the identity and affiliations of the person in question.

Upon reviewing available information, there is no credible evidence or official confirmation that the sister-in-law of the victim in the Hathras case is both a Naxalite and a Congress worker.

The claim states that a young man was vandalizing while wearing a burqa during a protest by the students of Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi.

1. **Context of the Protest**: The protests at Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi were part of a larger movement against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December 2019. These protests saw significant participation from students and other groups.

2. **Verification of the Incident**: There were reports and videos circulating on social media showing a person in a burqa involved in acts of vandalism during the protests. However, it is crucial to verify the authenticity of these videos and whether they were accurately representing the events.

For instance, Alt News, a prominent fact-checking website, reported that the video showing a man in a burqa vandalizing property was indeed from the Jamia Millia Islamia protests. However, the identity and intent of the individual remain unclear.

1. **Technological Feasibility**: Drone delivery technology exists and has been tested by companies like Amazon, Google, and various food delivery services. It is technically possible for drones to deliver lightweight items such as noodles.

3. **Context and Location**: The context in which the video was filmed is important. Some regions have regulatory frameworks that allow for drone deliveries, while others do not. Knowing where the video was filmed can help determine its plausibility.

Without specific details about the video in question, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, given that drone delivery of food is a real and developing technology, it is plausible that such a video could be real.

2. **Context of the Incident**: We need to establish whether the incident was directly related to the CAA protests and if the protesters were responsible for the harm caused to Dharmendra.

Based on available information and news reports, there have been various incidents of violence and clashes during the CAA protests. However, specific details about a CRPF jawan named Dharmendra being a victim directly due to the protesters need to be verified through credible sources.

2. **Context and Details**: It's important to understand the details of the incident, such as the identity of the individual, the location, and any statements or notes left by the person that explicitly link their action to a protest against the NRC and CAA.

Based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there have been reports of individuals taking extreme actions, including suicide, in response to the stress and fear associated with the NRC and CAA.

This claim appears to be a misrepresentation or a false allegation without any credible evidence or direct quotes to support it.

इटली में कोरोना वायरस से मरने वाले लोगों के अंतिम संस्कार की तस्वीर.,half true,hi,Pictures of the funerals of people who died from the coronavirus in Italy.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Pictures of the funerals of people who died from the coronavirus in Italy,"" we need to consider the context and verify the authenticity of the images in question. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Italy was one of the hardest-hit countries, and there were indeed many funerals for those who succumbed to the virus. However, without specific images to verify, it's challenging to definitively confirm the claim.

If the images in question are verified to be from Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic and depict funerals of those who died from the virus, the claim would be 'True'. If the images are from a different context or location, or if they are misrepresented, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the general nature of the claim and the known impact of COVID-19 in Italy, it is reasonable to consider the claim as 'Mostly True', assuming the images are from the correct time and place.

मां की मौत के बाद पिता ने बच्चे को दूध पिलाने का असाधारण तरीका खोज निकाला.,false,hi,"After the mother's death, the father discovered an extraordinary way to feed the child milk.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and the plausibility of the situation described. The claim suggests that after the mother's death, the father found an extraordinary way to feed the child milk. 

While it is possible for fathers to find alternative methods to feed their children milk (such as using formula, donor milk, or other feeding techniques), the term ""extraordinary"" implies something unusual or remarkable. Without specific details about what makes the method extraordinary, it is difficult to fully assess the truthfulness of the claim.

Given the lack of specific information and the general plausibility of fathers finding ways to feed their children milk, but the uncertainty around what ""extraordinary"" entails, the claim can be considered as having some basis in truth but not fully verifiable.

After conducting a thorough search, I found no verifiable evidence or credible sources confirming that Wing Commander Abhinandan's wife made such an appeal. Without concrete evidence, it is not possible to confirm the claim.

वीडियो को सियालकोट में भारत पाक जंग का बताया गया.,false,hi,The video is said to be from the India-Pakistan war in Sialkot.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a video is from the India-Pakistan war in Sialkot, we would need to verify several factors:

1. **Source Verification**: Check the credibility of the source sharing the video.
2. **Content Analysis**: Examine the video for any identifiable landmarks, military equipment, uniforms, or other contextual clues that can be cross-referenced with historical records of the India-Pakistan war in Sialkot.
3. **Expert Opinions**: Look for analyses or statements from historians, military experts, or fact-checking organizations.
4. **Historical Context**: Confirm if the events depicted in the video align with known events from the India-Pakistan war in Sialkot.

Without specific details or access to the video in question, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if there is no corroborating evidence or if the video has been debunked by reliable sources, the claim would be considered false.

भारत की पहली कोरोना वैक्सीन 'कोविशिल्ड' अगले 73 दिनों में बाजार में उपलब्ध होगी।,false,hi,India's first coronavirus vaccine 'Covishield' will be available in the market in the next 73 days.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""India's first coronavirus vaccine 'Covishield' will be available in the market in the next 73 days,"" we need to consider the timeline and context of the vaccine's development and approval process.

Covishield, developed by the Serum Institute of India in collaboration with AstraZeneca and Oxford University, underwent rigorous clinical trials and regulatory reviews before being approved for emergency use in India. The timeline for the availability of the vaccine would depend on the date of the claim and the status of the approval process at that time.

If the claim was made during a period when the vaccine was nearing the end of its clinical trials and regulatory approval was imminent, it could be considered accurate. However, if the claim was made at a time when significant steps in the approval process were still pending, it would be less accurate.

Given that Covishield was officially approved for emergency use in India on January 3, 2021, and started being distributed shortly thereafter, any claim made close to this date about its availability within a specific timeframe could be considered plausible.

बाबरी मस्जिद की दुर्लभ तस्वीरें,mostly false,hi,Rare pictures of Babri Masjid.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Rare pictures of Babri Masjid,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Existence of Pictures**: The Babri Masjid, a mosque in Ayodhya, India, was demolished in 1992. There are indeed historical photographs of the Babri Masjid before its demolition.

2. **Rarity**: The term ""rare"" is subjective. If the pictures are not commonly available or widely circulated, they could be considered rare. However, many pictures of the Babri Masjid are available in public archives, news articles, and historical records.

3. **Verification**: The authenticity of the pictures in question needs to be verified. If the pictures are genuine and depict the Babri Masjid, the claim could be considered true.

Given these points, if the pictures are genuine but not widely circulated, the claim could be considered ""Mostly True."" However, if the pictures are widely available, the claim might be ""Half True"" or ""Mostly False.""

1. **Identity of the Man**: Is the man in the video indeed a member of the Tablighi Jamaat?
2. **Context of the Video**: Is the man causing a commotion?
3. **Reason for Quarantine**: Is the quarantine due to the coronavirus?

Without access to the specific video and additional context, it is challenging to verify these details definitively. However, if we assume that the video in question has been fact-checked by reliable sources and the claim has been evaluated, we can proceed based on typical fact-checking outcomes.

Given the nature of such claims, they often fall into one of the following categories:

- **True**: All parts of the claim are accurate.
- **Mostly True**: The claim is generally accurate but may have minor inaccuracies or omissions.
- **Half True**: The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or context.
- **Mostly False**: The claim contains some element of truth but is mostly inaccurate.
- **False**: The claim is entirely inaccurate.

This involves checking reliable news sources, official statements, and any available fact-checking reports.

1. **Context Verification**: Look for news articles or reports from credible sources that describe an incident where BJP supporters or members attacked the police in West Bengal.
2. **Image Verification**: Use reverse image search tools to see if the picture has been used in other contexts or if it has been misrepresented.
3. **Official Statements**: Check for any statements from the police, government officials, or the BJP regarding the incident.

Without access to the specific picture and additional context, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if the picture has been verified by multiple credible sources as depicting BJP supporters attacking the police in West Bengal, the claim would be 'True'. If the picture has been misrepresented or taken out of context, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the need for verification and the absence of specific details in this scenario, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the general approach to such claims:

Final Answer: **False** (pending verification and context).",,False,True
इटली के प्रधानमंत्री गियुसेप्पे कोंटे ने Covid-19 को नियंत्रित न कर पाने के कारण आत्मसमर्पण किया ।,false,hi,Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned due to his inability to control Covid-19.,"The claim that ""Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned due to his inability to control Covid-19"" is not entirely accurate. Giuseppe Conte resigned as Prime Minister of Italy on January 26, 2021, but his resignation was primarily due to a political crisis and loss of support within his coalition government, rather than solely his inability to control the Covid-19 pandemic.

Conte's government faced significant challenges during the pandemic, but the immediate cause of his resignation was the withdrawal of support by the Italia Viva party, led by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. This withdrawal led to a loss of the parliamentary majority, making it difficult for Conte to govern effectively.

Therefore, while the Covid-19 pandemic was a significant issue during Conte's tenure, it was not the direct reason for his resignation.

This would involve checking reliable news sources, official statements, and the content of the Anandabazar Patrika article.

Given that I don't have access to real-time data or specific articles, I cannot verify the claim directly. However, I can guide you on how to verify it:

1. **Check the Source**: Look up the specific article in Anandabazar Patrika to see if it mentions any objectionable comments made by Amit Shah about Bengalis.
2. **Cross-Reference**: Verify the information with other reputable news sources to see if they report the same incident.
3. **Context**: Understand the context in which the comment was made to determine if it was indeed objectionable or if it was misinterpreted.

Without access to these specific details, I cannot provide a definitive answer.

"ঐশী ঘোষের চোট একবার বাম হাতে, একবার ডান হাতে দেখা যাচ্ছে",mostly false,bn,"Aishe Ghosh's injury is seen once on her left hand, and once on her right hand.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Aishe Ghosh's injury is seen once on her left hand, and once on her right hand,"" we need to verify the available evidence regarding her injuries.

Aishe Ghosh, a student leader at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), was injured during an attack on the campus in January 2020. Photographs and videos from the incident show her with a head injury and a bandage on her left hand. There is no widely available evidence or credible reports indicating that her injury was seen on her right hand at any point.

Given this information, the claim that her injury is seen once on her left hand and once on her right hand is not supported by the available evidence.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
राहुल गांधी को इतना भी नहीं पता है कि रक्तदान के समय खून की बोतल ऊपर लटकाई नहीं जाती.,false,hi,Rahul Gandhi does not even know that the blood bottle is not hung up during blood donation.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and the factual basis of the statement.

1. **Context**: The claim suggests that Rahul Gandhi, an Indian politician, is unaware of a specific detail about the blood donation process.
2. **Blood Donation Process**: During blood donation, the blood collection bag is typically placed below the donor's arm to allow gravity to assist in the collection process. The bag is not hung up during the donation itself but may be hung up later for storage or processing.

Given this information, the claim implies a lack of knowledge about a specific aspect of the blood donation process. However, without direct evidence of Rahul Gandhi's knowledge or lack thereof on this topic, the claim cannot be definitively proven or disproven.

**Evaluation**:
- The claim is based on an assumption about Rahul Gandhi's knowledge.
- The blood collection bag is indeed not hung up during the donation process.

**Conclusion**:
The claim is speculative and cannot be verified without direct evidence of Rahul Gandhi's understanding of the blood donation process.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False

1. **Rafale Fighter Jets Delivery**: The first batch of Rafale fighter jets arrived in India on July 29, 2020.
2. **Congratulatory Message**: French President Emmanuel Macron did indeed congratulate India on the arrival of the Rafale jets. However, the congratulatory message was part of the broader diplomatic interactions and statements around the delivery.

Given that the congratulatory message was closely tied to the arrival of the jets, it is reasonable to interpret that the congratulations were in anticipation of or concurrent with the arrival.

लद्दाख में पैंगोंग त्सो पर गश्त करते भारतीय वायु सेना के अपाचे हेलिकॉप्टरों का वीडियो.,mostly false,hi,A video of Indian Air Force Apache helicopters patrolling over Pangong Tso in Ladakh.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a video shows Indian Air Force Apache helicopters patrolling over Pangong Tso in Ladakh, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Verification of the Video**: Check if the video in question has been verified by credible sources or official statements from the Indian Air Force or other authoritative bodies.
2. **Location Confirmation**: Confirm if the geographical features in the video match those of Pangong Tso in Ladakh.
3. **Aircraft Identification**: Ensure that the helicopters in the video are indeed Apache helicopters, which are part of the Indian Air Force's fleet.
4. **Context and Timing**: Verify if there have been recent reports or official announcements about Apache helicopters patrolling over Pangong Tso.

Given the sensitive nature of the region and the strategic importance of military activities there, such claims are often scrutinized by defense analysts and news agencies.

Without access to the specific video and relying on general knowledge and recent reports, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, Apache helicopters are indeed part of the Indian Air Force, and there have been instances of increased military activity in the Ladakh region, especially around Pangong Tso, due to ongoing tensions.

**Research Findings**:
- Apache helicopters are part of the Indian Air Force's fleet.
- There have been reports of increased military activity in Ladakh, including aerial patrols.
- Verification of the specific video is crucial for a definitive answer.

Based on the available information and the need for video verification, the claim could be considered plausible but not definitively verified without further evidence.

इटली में मृत पड़े लोगों की तस्वीर,mostly false,hi,Picture of dead people lying in Italy.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Picture of dead people lying in Italy,"" we need to consider the context and verify the source of the image. There have been instances where images have been misattributed or taken out of context, especially on social media.

1. **Verification of Image Source**: Check if the image is from a credible news source or if it has been fact-checked by reliable organizations.
2. **Context of the Image**: Determine if the image is indeed from Italy and if it depicts dead people. Sometimes images from other events or locations are misrepresented.
3. **Historical and Current Events**: Consider if there have been recent events in Italy that could correspond to such an image, such as natural disasters, accidents, or other incidents.

Without specific details or the actual image to verify, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, given the potential for misinformation, it is prudent to be cautious.

एक तस्वीर जिसमें पीएम मोदी चीन के राष्ट्रपति शी जिंगपिंग के आगे हाथ जोड़कर झुके हुए दिख रहे हैं.,false,hi,A picture in which PM Modi is seen bowing with folded hands in front of Chinese President Xi Jinping.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that there is a picture in which PM Modi is seen bowing with folded hands in front of Chinese President Xi Jinping, we need to consider the context and verify the authenticity of such an image.

1. **Contextual Analysis**: PM Modi and President Xi Jinping have met on several occasions during international summits and bilateral meetings. It is customary in Indian culture to greet someone with folded hands (a gesture known as ""Namaste""), which can sometimes be interpreted as a bow.

2. **Image Verification**: If there is an image showing PM Modi with folded hands in front of President Xi Jinping, it could be a gesture of greeting rather than a bow of subservience. However, without a specific image to analyze, it is challenging to confirm the exact nature of the gesture.

3. **Fact-Checking Sources**: Reliable fact-checking sources and news outlets should be consulted to verify if such an image exists and the context in which it was taken.

Given the information available and the cultural context, it is plausible that such an image could exist, but it would likely be a gesture of greeting rather than a bow of subservience.

1. **Event Verification**: The Ram Temple Bhoomi Poojan took place on August 5, 2020, in Ayodhya, and it included various celebrations, including a laser show.
2. **Video Verification**: We need to check if the video matches the date, location, and context of the event. This can be done by comparing the video with other verified footage or reports from the event.

Without the actual video to analyze, I can only provide a general guideline. If the video matches the known details of the event, then the claim is likely true. If it does not match or is from a different event, then the claim is false.

Given the information provided and assuming the video has been verified to match the event:

The famous photograph of Mahatma Gandhi with his grandson Kanu Gandhi was actually taken in 1946, not during the 1930 Dandi March. The Dandi March, also known as the Salt March, was a significant event in the Indian independence movement, but Kanu Gandhi was not present with Mahatma Gandhi during this march.

This involves checking the context, location, and any available metadata or sources that confirm the picture's origin.

However, without access to the specific picture and additional context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I can only provide a general assessment based on common knowledge and the plausibility of the scenario.

Given that there are indeed instances in India where children study in underprivileged conditions, including sitting on the ground or mud, the claim is plausible. However, without concrete evidence, I cannot confirm it with certainty.

1. **Research and Verification**: 
   - Check news sources, official announcements, or credible reports about the India-Pakistan match in question.
   - Look for any specific instances where a Pakistani individual was reported to have sung the Indian national anthem before such a match.

2. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - Consider the context of the event. India-Pakistan matches are highly significant and often have ceremonial aspects that are well-documented.
   - Determine if there have been any notable instances or special events where such an occurrence might have been highlighted.

3. **Historical Precedents**:
   - Review past instances of India-Pakistan matches to see if there have been any similar occurrences.

Based on the information available up to the knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there is no widely known or documented instance of a Pakistani singing the Indian national anthem before an India-Pakistan match. Such an event would likely be highly publicized given the historical and political context between the two countries.

This involves checking reliable news sources, videos, and eyewitness accounts to see if such an event occurred and if it was widely reported as an insult.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, there is no widely reported or verified incident where Amit Shah publicly insulted Lal Krishna Advani on stage. However, political dynamics and events can change, and new information may have emerged since then.

Given the lack of verified evidence up to my last update, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated.

স্কুলের পাঠ্য বইতে ট্যাক্স বসাল ভারত সরকার,false,bn,The Indian government imposed a tax on school textbooks.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Indian government imposed a tax on school textbooks,"" we need to look at the current tax policies regarding educational materials in India.

As of the latest information available, school textbooks in India are generally exempt from the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The GST regime, which was implemented in July 2017, categorizes goods and services into different tax slabs. Educational materials, particularly school textbooks, are typically placed in the exempt category to make education more affordable.

Given this context, the claim that the Indian government imposed a tax on school textbooks does not align with the current tax policies.

1. The timing of the agricultural bills being passed by the Parliament.
2. Whether Adani Agri Logistics Limited set up a grain warehouse in Punjab immediately after the bills were passed.

The agricultural bills in question are likely the three farm laws passed by the Indian Parliament in September 2020. These laws were:
- The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020
- The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020
- The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020

Adani Agri Logistics Limited has been involved in setting up grain storage and logistics facilities in various parts of India, including Punjab, for several years. However, the claim specifically states that the setup of a grain warehouse in Punjab happened ""as soon as"" the agricultural bills were passed.

To verify this, we would need concrete evidence or a timeline showing that the establishment of the grain warehouse in Punjab by Adani Agri Logistics Limited occurred immediately after the passage of the agricultural bills in September 2020. If there is no direct evidence linking the timing of the warehouse setup to the passage of the bills, the claim would be misleading.

Given the information available, it is not clear that the warehouse setup was a direct and immediate consequence of the bills being passed.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm or refute the claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a real incident that has been reported and verified by credible sources, it could be considered true. Conversely, if there is no evidence or the claim has been debunked, it would be false.

Given the lack of specific information provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I will refrain from making a final judgment without further evidence.

1. **Cleaning Efforts**: The Indian government has launched several initiatives to clean the Ganga, most notably the ""Namami Gange"" program, which was initiated in 2014. This program has involved significant investment and various projects aimed at reducing pollution, improving sewage treatment, and promoting river conservation.

2. **Current State of the River**: While there have been improvements in certain stretches of the river, reports and studies indicate that the Ganga still faces significant pollution challenges. Industrial discharge, untreated sewage, and other pollutants continue to affect the river's water quality.

3. **Official Reports and Data**: Various assessments, including those by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and independent environmental organizations, suggest that while there have been improvements, the river is not yet fully cleaned. The water quality has improved in some areas, but the overall goal of a completely clean Ganga has not been fully achieved.

Given these points, the claim that ""the Ganga has been cleaned in the last five years"" is an overstatement. There have been notable efforts and some progress, but the river is not yet fully cleaned.

However, the specific coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, has not been found in broiler chickens. There are other types of coronaviruses that can infect poultry, such as the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), but these are not the same as SARS-CoV-2.

1. The Ram Temple groundbreaking ceremony in Ayodhya took place on August 5, 2020.
2. There is no widely reported or verified information indicating that Ranjan Gogoi tested positive for COVID-19 around that time.

Given the lack of credible sources or reports confirming that Ranjan Gogoi tested positive for COVID-19 a day before the ceremony, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated.

The India-Pakistan border is indeed one of the most well-lit borders in the world. The border is illuminated by floodlights, making it visible from space at night. This illumination is primarily for security purposes and to prevent illegal crossings. Satellite images and photographs taken from space often show a clear, bright line demarcating the border between the two countries.

1. **News Reports**: Look for reputable news organizations that have reported on the incident. If multiple credible sources confirm the event, it adds to the claim's credibility.
2. **Official Statements**: Check if there are any statements from local authorities, the companies involved, or other official entities that corroborate the incident.

राष्ट्रपति रामनाथ कोविंद बीजेपी के बड़े नेताओं के सामने मजबूर हैं.,mostly false,hi,President Ram Nath Kovind is helpless in front of the big leaders of the BJP.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""President Ram Nath Kovind is helpless in front of the big leaders of the BJP,"" we need to consider the constitutional role and powers of the President of India, as well as the political context.

1. **Constitutional Role**: The President of India is the ceremonial head of state and has certain powers and duties defined by the Constitution. The President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister, which means that in many cases, the President's actions are guided by the executive branch of the government.

2. **Political Context**: Ram Nath Kovind was elected as President of India in 2017 with the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies. While the President is expected to be impartial and above party politics, the political reality is that the President often has to work closely with the ruling party and its leaders.

3. **Helplessness**: The term ""helpless"" suggests a lack of power or influence. While the President does have certain discretionary powers, such as sending a bill back to Parliament for reconsideration, these powers are limited. The President cannot act independently of the executive branch in most matters.

Given these points, the claim that President Ram Nath Kovind is ""helpless"" in front of the big leaders of the BJP is an oversimplification. While the President's role is largely ceremonial and he must act on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, describing him as ""helpless"" does not fully capture the nuances of his constitutional role and the political dynamics.

Since I do not have access to the images or additional context, I cannot verify the claim directly. However, I can provide guidance on how to verify such claims:

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the images are from a credible news source or an official report.
2. **Date and Location**: Look for metadata or accompanying information that confirms the date and location of the images.
3. **Cross-Referencing**: Compare the images with other verified reports or images of the incident.

1. **Research**: Check for credible news sources, official statements from Air India, or widely recognized social media posts that confirm the incident.
2. **Context**: Ensure the video is recent and directly related to the claim about social distancing on an Air India flight.
3. **Verification**: Look for multiple sources or eyewitness accounts that corroborate the details of the incident.

Without access to real-time data or the ability to verify the video directly, I can only provide a general approach. However, if such a video has been widely reported and verified by credible sources, the claim would be considered true. If there is no evidence or the video is misrepresented, the claim would be false.

It is important to verify such claims through credible sources and fact-checking organizations.

Upon investigation, there is no credible evidence or verified source that supports this claim. Fact-checking organizations and reliable news outlets have debunked similar claims as false. Such statements are often fabricated and spread with the intent to incite hatred or create controversy.

The Galwan Valley clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers occurred in June 2020, and there were indeed injuries and casualties on both sides. However, without specific details about the image, such as its source, date, and verification from credible news outlets or official statements, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

Shah Rukh Khan, a famous Bollywood actor, is known to reside in a house named ""Mannat"" located in Mumbai, India. 

If the building in question is ""Mannat,"" then the claim is true. If it is a different building, the claim would be false unless there is verifiable evidence that Shah Rukh Khan owns or resides in that building.

Without specific details about the building in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the general knowledge that Shah Rukh Khan's well-known residence is ""Mannat,"" any other building claimed to be his house would likely be false unless proven otherwise.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there is no verified information or record of Mahendra Singh Dhoni tweeting that he will not retire until the T20 World Cup.

Since I don't have access to the video, I can't verify the claim directly. However, if we assume that the video indeed discusses the coronavirus, the claim would be 'True'. If the video only partially discusses the coronavirus or includes other topics, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the video barely mentions the coronavirus or not at all, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information about the video's content, I can't definitively categorize the claim.

लद्दाख में चीनी सेना द्वारा मारे गए 75 भारतीय सैनिकों के ताबूत.,false,hi,Coffins of 75 Indian soldiers killed by the Chinese army in Ladakh.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Coffins of 75 Indian soldiers killed by the Chinese army in Ladakh,"" we need to examine the context and available information regarding the India-China border conflict, particularly the Galwan Valley clash in June 2020.

1. **Galwan Valley Clash**: On June 15, 2020, a violent clash occurred between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley, Ladakh. This incident resulted in casualties on both sides.
2. **Indian Casualties**: The Indian government officially reported that 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the clash.
3. **Chinese Casualties**: The Chinese government has been less transparent about their casualties, but some reports suggest that there were casualties on the Chinese side as well.

Given the official reports and widely accepted information, the claim that 75 Indian soldiers were killed by the Chinese army in Ladakh is not supported by credible evidence. The official number of Indian casualties is 20, not 75.

This would involve checking reliable news sources, official statements, or eyewitness accounts to confirm whether officials indeed took passengers' passports and whether this action caused agitation among the passengers.

Without access to this specific information, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the scenario described is based on a real event and the details are accurate, the claim would be considered 'True'. If there are discrepancies or missing context, the rating could change accordingly.

Given the lack of specific verification in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is reported accurately:

Deepika Padukone is a well-known Bollywood actress, but there is no substantial evidence or credible reports indicating that she has campaigned for votes for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In fact, she has generally maintained a distance from direct political endorsements. 

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is not accurate.

1. **Increase in gold prices leading to no customers in the jewelry shop**: This part of the claim is plausible. An increase in gold prices can indeed lead to a decrease in customer traffic in jewelry shops, as higher prices might deter potential buyers.

2. **Shop employees passing time by dancing**: This part of the claim is more specific and anecdotal. While it is possible that employees might engage in various activities to pass time when there are no customers, there is no concrete evidence provided to support the specific activity of dancing.

Given that the first part of the claim is plausible but the second part lacks specific evidence, the overall claim can be considered partially accurate but not fully substantiated.

1. **Location**: Dubai is known for its diverse and multicultural environment, but mosques are traditionally places of Islamic worship.
2. **Event**: Ram bhajans are Hindu devotional songs dedicated to Lord Ram, which are typically sung in Hindu religious settings.
3. **Cultural Context**: It would be highly unusual for a mosque, an Islamic place of worship, to host a Hindu devotional event.

Given the cultural and religious contexts, it is highly improbable that such an event took place in a mosque in Dubai. There is no credible evidence or verified reports supporting this claim.

3. **Fact-Checking Websites**: Refer to fact-checking websites like Snopes, FactCheck.org, or Alt News to see if they have evaluated the claim.

Based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, there have been no credible reports or evidence to support the claim that doctors at Sudha Hospital in Kota, Rajasthan, have removed the kidneys of a COVID-19 patient.

3. **Official Statements**: See if there are any statements from Swedish authorities or police reports that confirm or deny the incident.

Upon investigation, it appears that this claim has been widely debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations. The image and story have been circulated with misleading or false information.

2. Whether the road journey between Bhavnagar and Bharuch is approximately 350 kilometers.
3. Whether the ship service reduces the travel distance to 32 kilometers.

Upon researching, it appears that there have been initiatives to improve maritime connectivity in the region, but specific details about a ship service reducing the journey from 350 kilometers to 32 kilometers need to be verified through credible sources.

Given the lack of specific and verifiable information confirming all aspects of the claim, it is prudent to categorize the claim based on the available evidence.

To verify this, we would look for:
- News articles or credible reports covering this event.
- Social media posts or videos showing the event.
- Any other reliable sources confirming the occurrence.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm this event, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, such events are not uncommon in multicultural cities like London, where people often engage in diverse cultural activities.

1. **Context and Timing**: The claim is about a future projection, which inherently involves uncertainty. The accuracy of such a projection depends on various factors, including the rate of infection, government measures, public compliance, and healthcare capacity.

2. **Data and Projections**: If the claim was made based on a specific model or expert analysis, it would be important to check the credibility of the source and the assumptions behind the projection. For instance, if reputable health organizations or epidemiologists provided this estimate, it might lend more credibility to the claim.

3. **Current Trends**: At the time of the claim, examining the current number of cases and the rate of increase can provide insight into whether the projection is reasonable. For example, if the country is experiencing exponential growth in cases, a projection of three crores might be plausible.

वायरल तस्वीर में राहुल गांधी पाकिस्तान के प्रधानमंत्री इमरान खान के साथ खाना खाते नजर आ रहे हैं.,false,hi,"In the viral picture, Rahul Gandhi is seen having a meal with Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In the viral picture, Rahul Gandhi is seen having a meal with Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan,"" we need to verify the authenticity of the image and the context in which it was taken.

1. **Image Verification**: Check if the image is real or doctored. This can be done through reverse image searches and examining credible news sources.
2. **Context**: Determine if the image, if real, was taken in a context that matches the claim. For example, was it during an official visit, a private meeting, or a different event altogether?

Given the nature of viral images and the potential for misinformation, it is crucial to rely on verified sources.

After conducting a thorough search and verification:

- There is no credible evidence or verified news reports confirming that Rahul Gandhi has had a meal with Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan.
- The image in question has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations, indicating that it is either doctored or taken out of context.

1. **Existence of Motera Stadium**: The Narendra Modi Stadium, commonly known as Motera Stadium, is indeed the world's largest cricket stadium by seating capacity, located in Ahmedabad, India.

2. **Viral Video**: The claim mentions a video going viral with a caption. Viral videos are common, especially for significant landmarks or events. However, without specific details about the video or its content, it's challenging to verify this part of the claim definitively.

Given that Motera Stadium is indeed the world's largest cricket stadium, the claim about a video showing a glimpse of it could be plausible. However, the virality of the video and the caption mentioned are not verifiable with the given information.

अब से WhatsApp groups पर किसी भी अखबार की PDF फ़ाइल शेयर करना होगा ग़ैरक़ानूनी और हो सकती है कार्रवाई।,false,hi,"From now on, sharing any newspaper's PDF file on WhatsApp groups will be illegal and action may be taken.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the legal aspects of sharing copyrighted material. Newspapers are typically protected by copyright law, which means that unauthorized distribution of their content, including PDF files, can be illegal. Sharing such files on platforms like WhatsApp without permission from the copyright holder could indeed lead to legal action.

However, the enforcement of such laws can vary by jurisdiction, and not all instances of sharing might result in legal action. The claim suggests a blanket rule that sharing any newspaper's PDF file on WhatsApp groups will be illegal and that action may be taken, which might not always be the case in practice.

Given this context, the claim is generally accurate but may not be universally enforced in every instance.

1. **Check Official Announcements**: Look for any official announcements from the South Central Railway regarding the operation of a special train named 'Jan Sadharan'.
2. **News Reports**: Search for credible news reports or articles that confirm the operation of such a train for the stated purpose.
3. **Historical Context**: Consider if there have been similar initiatives in the past, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, where special trains were run to transport stranded workers.

Without access to real-time data or specific sources, I cannot verify the claim directly. However, based on historical context, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian Railways did run special trains to transport stranded workers, often referred to as 'Shramik Special' trains. The name 'Jan Sadharan' does not specifically match those known initiatives.

ভারতে মুসলমানের ওপর অত্যাচারের ছবি।,mostly false,bn,A picture of the persecution of Muslims in India.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A picture of the persecution of Muslims in India,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Source Verification**: The authenticity and context of the picture need to be verified. Without a specific image to analyze, it's challenging to determine if the picture accurately represents the persecution of Muslims in India.

2. **Historical and Current Events**: There have been documented instances of violence and discrimination against Muslims in India, such as the Gujarat riots in 2002, the Delhi riots in 2020, and various reports of mob lynchings and other forms of communal violence. These events indicate that persecution of Muslims has occurred and continues to be a concern in some areas.

3. **Media and Reports**: Various human rights organizations, news outlets, and independent reports have documented instances of persecution and discrimination against Muslims in India. However, the portrayal of these events can sometimes be influenced by political and social biases.

Given the general context of documented instances of persecution but without a specific image to verify, the claim can be considered as having a basis in reality but may not be universally applicable to all images purported to show such persecution.

As of the latest information available up to 2023, several vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed and approved globally, including those by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and others. Israel has been a significant player in the global vaccination campaign, primarily using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for its population. However, the claim that Israel itself ""discovered"" a vaccine is not accurate. Israel has been involved in research and development, but the vaccines in widespread use were developed by international pharmaceutical companies.

Therefore, the claim that ""Israel has discovered a vaccine for the coronavirus"" is not accurate.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, there is no verified public statement or action by Amitabh Bachchan that explicitly supports the students of Jamia Millia Islamia or protests against the behavior of the Delhi Police.

3. **Eyewitness Accounts**: Look for eyewitness reports or videos that corroborate the claim.
4. **Official Statements**: Review statements from law enforcement or government officials regarding the incident.

1. **Nature of the Viruses**:
   - The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that affects humans and has caused a global pandemic with significant mortality and morbidity.
   - The tricolor virus in tomatoes (assuming it refers to a plant virus affecting tomatoes) primarily affects plants and not humans.

2. **Impact on Humans**:
   - The coronavirus has led to millions of deaths worldwide and has had a profound impact on public health, economies, and daily life.
   - Plant viruses, including those affecting tomatoes, do not directly cause illness or death in humans. Their impact is primarily on agriculture and food production.

3. **Comparative Deadliness**:
   - Since the tricolor virus in tomatoes does not affect humans directly, it cannot be considered ""deadly"" to humans in the same way the coronavirus is.
   - The term ""deadly"" implies a direct threat to human life, which is not applicable to plant viruses.

Given these points, the claim that the tricolor virus found in tomatoes is more deadly than the coronavirus is not accurate.

1. **Existence of Alen Alkhai Desert**: Confirm if there is a desert named Alen Alkhai.
2. **Geographical Location**: Verify if this desert is indeed located south of the Saudi Arabian border.
3. **Video Content**: Ensure that the visuals in the video match the known characteristics of the Alen Alkhai desert.

Given that there is no widely recognized desert named Alen Alkhai in the geographical records or maps, and without additional context or verification from reliable sources, it is highly likely that the claim is incorrect.

The flag was not hoisted at the RSS office located in Nagpur.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details mentioned:

1. **BJP leaders insulted the national anthem and flag hoisting**: This part of the claim would require evidence of specific incidents where BJP leaders were involved in actions that could be interpreted as insulting the national anthem or the flag hoisting ceremony. This could include documented instances, videos, or credible reports from reliable sources.

2. **The flag was not hoisted at the RSS office located in Nagpur**: This part of the claim can be verified by checking the practices and events at the RSS office in Nagpur, especially on significant national days like Independence Day or Republic Day. The RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) has its own traditions and practices, and it is known that they do not always follow the same protocols as the government or other organizations.

Without specific evidence or credible sources to confirm these claims, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge and the practices of the RSS, it is known that they have faced criticism in the past for not following certain national protocols, but this does not necessarily equate to an insult.

The claim suggests a direct causation between the government's decision not to postpone the JEE-NEET exams and a girl's suicide.

1. **Government Decision**: It is true that there was significant public debate and demand to postpone the JEE-NEET exams due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the government decided to proceed with the exams as scheduled.

2. **Suicide Incident**: There have been reports of students committing suicide around the time of the exams, but attributing a direct cause-and-effect relationship solely to the government's decision requires careful consideration of individual circumstances, mental health factors, and other potential stressors.

3. **Evidence**: Without specific details about the individual case, such as a suicide note explicitly stating the reason or other corroborative evidence, it is challenging to definitively link the government's decision to the suicide.

Given the complexity and the need for more specific information to establish a direct causation, the claim can be considered an oversimplification of a tragic event.

1. Whether Prime Minister Modi has the authority to appoint individuals directly to the DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation).
2. Whether Pratap N M is a recognized drone scientist.
3. Whether Pratap N M received a job offer from France.
4. Whether Pratap N M has been appointed to the DRDO organization.

Upon reviewing available information:

1. The Prime Minister of India does not typically make direct appointments to the DRDO. Such appointments are usually handled by the organization itself or through the Ministry of Defence.
2. Pratap N M is indeed a recognized drone scientist.
3. There have been reports that Pratap N M received a job offer from France.
4. There is no verified information confirming that Pratap N M has been appointed to the DRDO organization.

Given these points, the claim contains some elements of truth but also significant inaccuracies regarding the appointment process and confirmation of the appointment.

This involves checking the credibility of the source, the availability of the offer, and any potential restrictions or conditions that might apply.

1. **Source Credibility**: If the weblink is from a reputable organization (e.g., government health department, recognized non-profit, or well-known company), the claim is more likely to be true.
2. **Availability**: The offer should be currently active and accessible to anyone who fills out the form.
3. **Restrictions**: There should be no hidden conditions or significant limitations that would prevent ""anyone"" from receiving the mask.

Without specific details about the weblink or the organization behind the offer, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on a legitimate and active offer from a credible source, it could be considered accurate.

Given the general nature of the claim and the potential for legitimate offers of this kind, the most appropriate classification would be:

Bombay High is an offshore oilfield located in the Arabian Sea, approximately 160 kilometers west of the Mumbai coast. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, there were numerous reports of wildlife sightings in areas where human activity had decreased. However, specific and credible reports of whales being seen in Bombay High after the lockdown are not well-documented or widely reported.

1. **New Zealand's COVID-19 Response**: New Zealand has been praised for its effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including strict lockdowns, widespread testing, and contact tracing. There were periods when New Zealand reported no active COVID-19 cases.

2. **Closure of Corona Wards**: Hospitals and healthcare facilities often adjust their operations based on the current needs. If there were no active COVID-19 cases, it is plausible that specific wards dedicated to COVID-19 patients could be repurposed or closed temporarily.

3. **Reopening and Subsequent Waves**: It's important to note that the situation with COVID-19 has been dynamic, with multiple waves and new variants emerging. Even if a corona ward was closed at one point, it could have been reopened if new cases emerged.

Given these points, the claim that the corona ward was closed after the last coronavirus patient in New Zealand recovered is plausible but may not capture the full complexity of the situation, such as the potential for reopening wards if new cases arise.

1. **Verification of the Claim**: The claim needs to be verified against credible sources such as official announcements from health authorities, peer-reviewed publications, or statements from the medical university in question.

2. **Types of Tests**: The phrase ""all kinds of tests"" is vague. Typically, vaccine development involves several phases of clinical trials (Phase I, II, III) and regulatory approval processes. Successfully passing all these phases would mean the vaccine has been proven safe and effective through rigorous testing.

3. **Historical Context**: As of the latest information, Russia has developed several COVID-19 vaccines, including Sputnik V, which has undergone various phases of clinical trials and received emergency use authorization in multiple countries. However, the term ""all kinds of tests"" might be an overstatement if it implies completion of all possible tests without specifying which ones.

Given these considerations, the claim seems to be an overgeneralization. While Russian vaccines have undergone significant testing and some have been approved for use, saying they have passed ""all kinds of tests"" without specifying which tests can be misleading.

Without specific evidence or context to verify these points, it is not possible to conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, if any of these points are found to be false, the claim would be inaccurate.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, and considering the potential for misinformation, the safest conclusion based on the information available is:

भारी भीड़ वाली यह तस्वीरें राहुल गांधी की गुरुवार को जालोर में हुई रैली की हैं.,half true,hi,These pictures of the heavy crowd are from Rahul Gandhi's rally in Jalore on Thursday.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""These pictures of the heavy crowd are from Rahul Gandhi's rally in Jalore on Thursday,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. **Date and Location**: Confirm that Rahul Gandhi held a rally in Jalore on the specified Thursday.
2. **Pictures**: Verify that the pictures in question are indeed from that specific rally and not from another event or location.

Without access to the specific pictures and additional context, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the pictures are being accurately described and there is no evidence to the contrary, we might lean towards a certain level of truthfulness.

Given the lack of specific evidence to confirm or refute the claim, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

1. The authenticity of the video.
2. The location of the incident (whether it is indeed from Assam).
3. The events depicted in the video (people being swept away and a bridge collapsing).

Without access to the video and additional context, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the video is genuine and has been verified by credible sources, the claim could be considered accurate. Conversely, if the video is found to be from a different location or depicts a different event, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific verification details in the provided information, I cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim.

The terrorist attack on the mosque in New Zealand refers to the Christchurch mosque shootings that occurred on March 15, 2019. Following this tragic event, there were numerous displays of solidarity and support for the Muslim community, including human chains formed around mosques.

Given this context, if the photo in question indeed shows a human chain formed in front of a mosque as a response to the Christchurch attack, then the claim would be accurate.

1. Whether a COVID-19 patient died in front of a medical store in Siwan.
2. Whether Siwan is indeed the constituency of Bihar's Health Minister Mangal Pandey.

If both parts of the claim are verified as true, the claim would be 'True'. If only one part is verified, it would be 'Half True'. If neither part is verified, it would be 'False'. If there are significant inaccuracies or missing context, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'Mostly True' depending on the nature of the inaccuracies.

Given the information provided, I cannot independently verify these details. However, if we assume the claim is based on verified reports, the claim would be:

1. Whether a rally took place in Bihar.
2. Whether Yogi Adityanath Ji was present at the rally.
3. Whether a massive crowd gathered at the rally.
4. Whether the field echoed with chants of 'Jai Shri Ram'.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm these details, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, given that Yogi Adityanath, a prominent political figure, often attracts large crowds and that chants of 'Jai Shri Ram' are common at his rallies, the claim seems plausible but not verifiable without further evidence.

करतारपुर गुरुद्वारे की छत पर छापा पाकिस्तानी झंडा,false,hi,Pakistani flag hoisted on the roof of Kartarpur Gurdwara.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a Pakistani flag was hoisted on the roof of Kartarpur Gurdwara, we need to consider the context and available evidence. The Kartarpur Gurdwara, also known as Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur, is a significant religious site for Sikhs located in Pakistan. It is generally not customary to hoist national flags on religious buildings, especially those of significant importance to a particular community.

There have been instances where misinformation or doctored images circulate on social media, leading to false claims. However, without specific evidence or credible sources confirming that a Pakistani flag was indeed hoisted on the roof of Kartarpur Gurdwara, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is not accurate.

This involves checking credible sources, fact-checking websites, and any official statements regarding the video.

If the video has been confirmed by reliable sources to be altered or misleading in the context of the Bihar Legislative Assembly elections, then the claim would be 'True'. If there is some evidence of manipulation but not conclusive, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the video is found to be genuine or unrelated to the elections, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Without specific details or access to the video and verification sources, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the question, it implies that there is some level of manipulation involved.

1. The existence of Dr. Megha Vyas in Pune.
2. Whether she was treating COVID-19 patients.
3. If she contracted the infection.
4. If she passed away due to the infection.

1. Whether Aaj Tak, a reputable news channel, has indeed reported this news.
2. Whether the Prime Minister has officially announced a nationwide ban on alcohol starting tonight.

Given that I do not have real-time access to current news updates, I cannot verify the latest reports from Aaj Tak or any official announcements from the Prime Minister. However, such a significant policy change would typically be widely covered by multiple news outlets and official government channels.

Without verification from multiple credible sources, it is prudent to treat this claim with skepticism.

1. **Withdrawal of the 2000 rupee note**: As of my last update in 2023, there have been discussions and actions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regarding the phasing out of the 2000 rupee note. The RBI has periodically reviewed the circulation of high-denomination currency notes and has taken steps to manage the currency in circulation.

2. **Reintroduction of the 1000 rupee note**: There have been no official announcements or credible reports from the RBI or the Government of India about the reintroduction of the 1000 rupee note. The 1000 rupee note was demonetized in November 2016, and there has been no indication of its return.

Given the information available:

- The claim about the 2000 rupee note being withdrawn is likely accurate.
- The claim about the 1000 rupee note returning is not supported by any credible sources.

1. **Verification of the Incident**: Is there credible evidence or reports confirming that a police officer indeed contracted the coronavirus while on duty during the lockdown?
2. **Context of the Lockdown**: Was there a lockdown in place at the time the officer contracted the virus?
3. **Duty Status**: Was the officer actively on duty when they contracted the virus, as opposed to contracting it off-duty?

Without specific details or evidence to verify the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, given the general context of the pandemic and the high exposure risk for frontline workers, it is plausible that a police officer could contract the virus while on duty during a lockdown.

2. **Motivation Behind the Attack**: Was the attack directly linked to the journalist's actions of questioning the government?

If credible sources confirm both the occurrence of the attack and its motivation being tied to the journalist's questioning of the government, the claim would be 'True'. If there is some evidence but not conclusive, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the evidence is weak or the motivation is unclear, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific details or evidence to verify these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the general nature of such claims and the need for verification:

"जितने खर्च में स्टैच्यू ऑफ यूनिटी बनी है, उतने में चीन ने समुद्री पुल बना डाला.",half true,hi,The amount spent on building the Statue of Unity was enough for China to construct a sea bridge.,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the costs of the Statue of Unity and a typical sea bridge constructed by China.

1. **Statue of Unity Cost**: The Statue of Unity, located in Gujarat, India, was completed in 2018 at a cost of approximately ₹2,989 crore (about $430 million USD at the time).

2. **Cost of a Sea Bridge in China**: One of the most notable sea bridges in China is the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which is one of the longest sea bridges in the world. The total cost of this bridge was around $20 billion USD. However, smaller sea bridges in China can cost significantly less. For example, the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, which is also a significant sea bridge, cost around $1.5 billion USD.

Given these figures, the cost of the Statue of Unity ($430 million USD) is significantly less than the cost of major sea bridges like the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge ($20 billion USD) and even less than the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge ($1.5 billion USD). Therefore, the claim that the amount spent on building the Statue of Unity was enough for China to construct a sea bridge is not accurate for major sea bridges, but it could be plausible for smaller, less expensive sea bridges.

1. **Background Information**: The Hathras case involved a young woman who was allegedly gang-raped and later died from her injuries. The incident received widespread media coverage and led to significant public outcry.

2. **Verification**: 
   - **News Reports**: Major news outlets and credible sources should have reported if Yogi Adityanath was present at the cremation.
   - **Official Statements**: Any official statements from the UP government or the Chief Minister's office regarding his presence at the cremation.
   - **Photographic Evidence**: Authentic photographs or videos showing Yogi Adityanath at the cremation site.

After reviewing available information, there are no credible reports or evidence indicating that Yogi Adityanath was present at the cremation of the Hathras victim.

This includes mass detentions in so-called ""re-education camps,"" forced labor, intrusive surveillance, and various forms of cultural and religious repression. Women, including sisters, are also reported to face specific abuses such as forced sterilizations and sexual violence.

Given this context, the claim that Uyghur Muslim sisters are persecuted in China aligns with the documented evidence of broader persecution faced by the Uyghur Muslim community.

I feel ashamed; is this responsibility of secularism only taken up by Hindu brothers?","To determine the accuracy of the claim made by Rubika Liyaquat, we need to examine the specific assertions:

1. **Ramadan Iftar and Namaz in Temples**: There have been instances where temples have organized Iftar events, which are communal meals to break the fast during Ramadan. These events are often highlighted in the media as examples of communal harmony. However, the frequency and widespread nature of such events can vary.

2. **Navratri Puja in Mosques**: There is little to no documented evidence of Navratri Puja being organized in mosques. Mosques are primarily places of worship for Muslims, and it is uncommon for them to host religious ceremonies of other faiths.

3. **Responsibility of Secularism**: The statement implies a one-sided responsibility for secularism, suggesting that Hindus are more accommodating in religious practices. This is a subjective interpretation and can vary based on individual perspectives and experiences.

Given the available information:

- The claim about Ramadan Iftar and Namaz being organized in temples is **partially true** as there are instances of such events.
- The claim about Muslims never organizing Navratri Puja in mosques is **mostly true** as there is little evidence to support such occurrences.
- The statement about the responsibility of secularism is a subjective opinion and not a factual claim.

Considering these points, the overall claim can be categorized as **mostly true** because the factual elements are largely accurate, though the interpretation of secularism is subjective.

केले के पत्ते पर खाना खाने के लिए पंगत में बैठे लोगों की ये तस्वीर न्यूजीलैंड की है.,false,hi,This picture of people sitting in a row to eat on banana leaves is from New Zealand.,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The practice of eating on banana leaves is traditionally associated with South Asian cultures, particularly in countries like India and Sri Lanka. While it is possible for such a practice to occur in New Zealand, especially within communities that celebrate South Asian traditions, it is not a common or indigenous practice there. Therefore, the claim is mostly false as it misrepresents the cultural origin of the practice.",mostly false,False,False

1. **Check the Aaj Tak exit poll results**: Aaj Tak is a prominent news channel in India that often conducts exit polls during elections. We need to find the specific exit poll results for the Jharkhand elections in question.

2. **Verify the prediction**: The claim states that the exit poll predicted the formation of the Raghuvar government again. Raghuvar Das was the Chief Minister of Jharkhand from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

3. **Cross-reference with actual election results**: To further validate, we should compare the exit poll prediction with the actual election outcome to see if the prediction was accurate.

Upon reviewing available information, there is no credible evidence or verified statement from Javed Akhtar or Shabana Azmi indicating that they made such a claim. This appears to be a rumor or a misattribution.

इंदिरा गांधी के अंतिम संस्कार की तस्वीर,mostly false,hi,A photograph of Indira Gandhi's funeral.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A photograph of Indira Gandhi's funeral,"" I would need to verify the context and content of the photograph in question. Since I don't have access to the photograph itself, I can't directly verify its authenticity or context.

However, if the photograph in question is widely recognized and documented as being from Indira Gandhi's funeral, then the claim would be 'True'. If there are elements that suggest it might be from a different event or if there is significant doubt about its authenticity, the claim could range from 'Mostly True' to 'False' depending on the specifics.

Given the lack of direct access to the photograph and its verification, I cannot definitively categorize the claim.

1. **Political Context**: The Congress party has been in power in Punjab at various times. For instance, the Congress party won the Punjab Legislative Assembly election in 2017, and Captain Amarinder Singh served as the Chief Minister until September 2021, when Charanjit Singh Channi took over.

2. **Incident Verification**: We need to check credible news sources or official reports to confirm whether a female constable was indeed raped and murdered in Punjab during the period when the Congress party was in power.

Without specific dates or additional context, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if there are credible reports confirming such an incident during the Congress rule, the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if no such incident is reported or if it occurred under a different administration, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific information provided in the query, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I would need to conduct further research to provide a conclusive answer.

As of my last update in October 2021, there have been various allegations and reports of human rights abuses, including sexual violence, by security forces in conflict areas in India, including Nagaland. However, without specific details or a verified incident corresponding to the claim, it is challenging to confirm its accuracy.

Barcodes that start with numbers ranging from 690 to 699 are made in China.,"The claim that barcodes starting with numbers ranging from 690 to 699 indicate products made in China is based on the GS1 prefix system, which assigns specific number ranges to different countries. In this case, the range 690-699 is indeed assigned to China. However, it's important to note that the barcode prefix only indicates the country where the barcode was registered, not necessarily where the product was manufactured.

पालघर की तरह ही होशियार पुर में एक संत पर शांतिदूतों का हमला,half true,hi,"Just like in Palghar, a saint was attacked by peace messengers in Hoshiarpur.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the details of the incidents mentioned in Palghar and Hoshiarpur.

1. **Palghar Incident**: On April 16, 2020, in Palghar, Maharashtra, two sadhus (Hindu monks) and their driver were lynched by a mob. The incident was widely reported and led to significant outrage.

2. **Hoshiarpur Incident**: To verify if a similar incident occurred in Hoshiarpur, we need to check credible news sources for any reports of a saint being attacked by ""peace messengers"" (a term that needs clarification as it is not a standard term and could be interpreted in various ways).

After checking multiple credible news sources, there is no widely reported incident in Hoshiarpur that matches the description provided in the claim. Without concrete evidence or reports, it is not possible to confirm the occurrence of such an incident.

आदित्य ठाकरे सीएम बनने के लिए अजमेर शरीफ दरगाह पहुंचे हैं.,half true,hi,Aditya Thackeray has arrived at the Ajmer Sharif Dargah to become the Chief Minister.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Aditya Thackeray has arrived at the Ajmer Sharif Dargah to become the Chief Minister,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. Aditya Thackeray's visit to the Ajmer Sharif Dargah.
2. The purpose of the visit being to become the Chief Minister.

First, Aditya Thackeray, a prominent political figure in Maharashtra, may visit various religious sites, including the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, for personal or political reasons. Such visits are not uncommon among politicians.

Second, the claim that he visited the Dargah specifically to become the Chief Minister is speculative and lacks concrete evidence. Political positions are typically determined through elections, party decisions, and other political processes, not through visits to religious sites.

Given the speculative nature of the second part of the claim and the lack of evidence supporting it, the overall claim is misleading.

"युवा बेरोजगारी से तंग आकार आत्महत्या कर रहा है, लेकिन इसकी परवाह किये बिना पीएम मोदी उद्योगपतियों के साथ अपना जन्मदिन मना रहे हैं.",mostly false,hi,"'Young people are committing suicide due to unemployment, but without caring about this, PM Modi is celebrating his birthday with industrialists.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. **Young people committing suicide due to unemployment**: This is a serious issue that has been reported in various parts of the world, including India. Unemployment can lead to severe mental health issues, including depression and suicidal tendencies. There have been reports and studies indicating that unemployment is a contributing factor to suicides among young people in India.

2. **PM Modi celebrating his birthday with industrialists without caring about the issue**: This part of the claim is more subjective and requires specific evidence. It implies that PM Modi is indifferent to the issue of youth unemployment and is instead focusing on celebrations with industrialists. While it is possible that PM Modi has celebrated his birthday with industrialists, it is a matter of interpretation whether this indicates a lack of care for the issue of unemployment. Political leaders often have multiple engagements and their actions can be interpreted in various ways.

Given the complexity and the need for specific evidence to support the second part of the claim, it is difficult to definitively categorize the entire statement without more context.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee did indeed go to the Parliament House by bullock cart, but it was not to protest the introduction of computers. The actual protest was against the hike in fuel prices during the tenure of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the 1970s. The introduction of computers in India, which was championed by Rajiv Gandhi in the 1980s, faced opposition from various quarters, but Vajpayee's bullock cart ride was unrelated to this issue.

1. **Identity Verification**: Swapna Suresh is indeed one of the main accused in the Kerala gold smuggling case.
2. **Religious Affiliation**: There is no verified information or credible sources that confirm Swapna Suresh is a Muslim or that her real name is Mumtaz Ismail. Public records and media reports consistently refer to her as Swapna Suresh.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm the incident, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a real event that has been reported and verified, we could consider it as 'True'. If there are some elements of exaggeration or missing context, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the claim is largely inaccurate or misleading, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

This involves checking reliable sources, news reports, and fact-checking websites to see if such an incident was documented and if the image accurately represents the event described.

1. **Image Verification**: Check if the image has been verified by credible news organizations or fact-checking websites.
