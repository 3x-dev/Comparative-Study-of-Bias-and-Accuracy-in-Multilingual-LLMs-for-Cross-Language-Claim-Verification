"“Što se tiče tramvaja, oni nisu mogli da prođu zbog okupljenih građana, a saobraćaj je normalizovan posle završetka protesta.”",false,sr,"""As for the trams, they could not pass due to the gathered citizens, and traffic was normalized after the protest ended.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the following points:

1. **Trams could not pass due to the gathered citizens**: This part of the claim suggests that the presence of citizens during the protest obstructed the trams. If there is evidence or reports confirming that the trams were indeed blocked by the protestors, this part would be true.

2. **Traffic was normalized after the protest ended**: This part of the claim indicates that once the protest concluded, the traffic, including the trams, returned to normal. If there is evidence or reports confirming that traffic resumed its normal flow after the protest, this part would also be true.

Without specific evidence or reports to confirm these details, we can only assess the claim based on its plausibility and typical outcomes of such events. Protests often disrupt public transportation and traffic, and it is common for normalcy to return once the protest ends.

Given the general nature of the claim and the typical outcomes of protests, it seems plausible. However, without concrete evidence, we cannot fully verify it.

"Медианный размер средней зарплаты в январе составлял 112 тыс тенге. А модальный, то есть самый распространенный размер зарплаты, составляет 58 тыс тенге.",true,ru,"The median size of the average salary in January was 112 thousand tenge. The modal, or most common, salary size is 58 thousand tenge.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Median Salary**: The median salary is stated to be 112 thousand tenge. The median is the middle value in a list of numbers, meaning that half of the salaries are below this amount and half are above.

2. **Modal Salary**: The modal salary is stated to be 58 thousand tenge. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set.

The claim provides specific values for both the median and the mode. Without additional context or data to verify these specific figures, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim based on the definitions of median and mode.

Given that the median and mode are different statistical measures and can indeed have different values in a data set, the claim is logically consistent. Therefore, without further data to contradict these specific figures, the claim can be considered accurate based on the definitions provided.

„Demokratska stranka je ispunila sve ono što je pre četiri godine obećala.“,false,sr,"""The Democratic Party has fulfilled everything it promised four years ago.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Democratic Party has fulfilled everything it promised four years ago,"" we need to evaluate the promises made by the Democratic Party four years ago and assess whether they have been fully met.

1. **Review of Promises**: The Democratic Party's platform from four years ago would include a range of promises on various issues such as healthcare, economy, climate change, education, immigration, and more.

2. **Assessment of Fulfillment**:
   - **Healthcare**: Did the Democratic Party achieve its goals related to healthcare reform, such as expanding access to healthcare or reducing costs?
   - **Economy**: Were economic promises such as job creation, wage increases, and economic growth met?
   - **Climate Change**: Were significant steps taken to address climate change, such as implementing green energy policies or reducing carbon emissions?
   - **Education**: Were promises related to education, such as increasing funding for schools or making college more affordable, fulfilled?
   - **Immigration**: Were immigration reforms promised by the Democratic Party enacted?

3. **Analysis**: Typically, political parties may achieve some of their goals but not all, due to various factors such as political opposition, economic constraints, and unforeseen events (e.g., a pandemic).

Given the complexity and breadth of political promises, it is unlikely that any party would fulfill every single promise made. Therefore, the claim that ""The Democratic Party has fulfilled everything it promised four years ago"" is likely an overstatement.

Парламент Швейцарии одобрил закон о запрете вакцинации граждан,false,ru,The Swiss Parliament has approved a law banning the vaccination of citizens.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Swiss Parliament has approved a law banning the vaccination of citizens,"" we need to verify the information against reliable sources and recent news updates.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there have been no credible reports or official announcements indicating that the Swiss Parliament has approved any law banning the vaccination of citizens. Switzerland has generally supported vaccination programs, especially in the context of public health measures against diseases like COVID-19.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim and the context of Switzerland's public health policies, the claim appears to be unfounded.

1. **Negotiations with the Ministry of Education**: This part of the claim suggests that discussions are ongoing with the Ministry of Education. If there is verifiable information that such negotiations are indeed taking place, this part of the claim can be considered accurate.

2. **Yielding Results**: This implies that the negotiations have led to some positive outcomes or progress. Evidence of any agreements, approvals, or steps forward would support this part of the claim.

3. **One Step Away from Opening**: This suggests that the process is in its final stages, with only minor formalities or final approvals remaining. Confirmation of this would require specific details about the current status of the process, such as final approvals pending or infrastructure being prepared.

Without specific evidence or detailed information confirming each of these points, it is challenging to fully validate the claim. However, if there are credible reports or official statements supporting the progress and near-finalization of the Faculty of Theology in Niš, the claim could be considered accurate to a certain extent.

Given the need for more detailed verification, the most cautious and balanced assessment would be:

2. **Employment Increase**: It mentions a slight increase in the number of employed people.
3. **Trend Uncertainty**: It states that it remains to be seen whether this will signify the beginning of a new trend.

Given that the claim acknowledges the uncertainty about whether the increase will lead to a new trend, it is cautious and does not overstate the situation. The claim is specific about the timing and the nature of the increase (slight), which makes it a balanced statement.

Without additional context or data to refute the specifics of the timing or the increase, the claim appears to be reasonable and factually cautious.

I know myself from when I played how much was owed to players, and I can proudly say that this is not the case now.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **No Delays Towards Water Polo Players and Federations**: This implies that all payments and obligations are being met on time.
2. **Government Settled All Obligations**: This suggests that the government has fulfilled all its financial commitments to athletes.
3. **Historical Context**: The speaker references a past situation where players were owed money, implying a significant improvement.

Without specific data or evidence to confirm these points, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the speaker is a credible source and there are no contradicting reports, we might lean towards a positive assessment.

Only 7.5% of all investments in science come from the private sector, which is significantly below the EU average where private sector investments make up as much as 55% of all investments in science.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. **Science Allocations in Serbia**: The claim states that Serbia allocates 1% of its GDP to science.
2. **EU Average Science Allocations**: The claim states that the EU average was around 2% of GDP in 2013.
3. **Private Sector Investments in Serbia**: The claim states that only 7.5% of all investments in science in Serbia come from the private sector.
4. **EU Average Private Sector Investments**: The claim states that private sector investments make up 55% of all investments in science in the EU.

### Verification:

1. **Science Allocations in Serbia**:
   - According to various reports and data from organizations like UNESCO and the World Bank, Serbia's investment in research and development (R&D) has been around 0.9% to 1% of GDP in recent years. This aligns with the claim.

2. **EU Average Science Allocations**:
   - The EU's average investment in R&D has been around 2% of GDP, with a target to reach 3% by 2020. In 2013, the average was indeed close to 2%. This aligns with the claim.

3. **Private Sector Investments in Serbia**:
   - Data from sources like the European Commission and national statistics indicate that private sector investment in R&D in Serbia is relatively low, often cited around 7-8%. This aligns with the claim.

4. **EU Average Private Sector Investments**:
   - The EU average for private sector investment in R&D is indeed around 55%, as reported by the European Commission and other relevant bodies. This aligns with the claim.

Given that all the specific points in the claim align with available data, the claim is accurate.

1. Whether Poland currently spends 2% of its GDP on defense.
2. Whether Poland has announced plans to increase this spending to 2.5% of its GDP.

1. **Current Defense Spending**: According to NATO and various defense expenditure reports, Poland has been meeting the NATO guideline of spending at least 2% of its GDP on defense. This has been a consistent policy, especially in light of regional security concerns.

2. **Future Defense Spending Plans**: Poland has indeed announced plans to increase its defense spending to 2.5% of GDP. This announcement aligns with Poland's commitment to strengthening its military capabilities and addressing security challenges in the region.

Given that both points in the claim are accurate, the statement is well-supported by available data.

В Казахстане ежегодно изымается от 20 до 40 тонн различных наркотических веществ.,true,ru,"In Kazakhstan, between 20 and 40 tons of various narcotic substances are seized annually.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Kazakhstan, between 20 and 40 tons of various narcotic substances are seized annually,"" we need to look at reliable sources such as reports from international organizations, government statistics, or credible news outlets.

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and other relevant sources, Kazakhstan has been a significant transit country for narcotics, particularly opiates from Afghanistan. However, the specific quantity of narcotics seized can vary from year to year.

Based on available data, the amount of narcotics seized in Kazakhstan has fluctuated, but it is generally within the range mentioned in the claim. For instance, in some years, the reported seizures have been closer to the lower end of the range, while in other years, they have approached the higher end.

Given this information, the claim appears to be generally accurate but may not be precise for every single year.

„Vlada od početka godine nije uputila nijedan proevropski zakonski predlog Skupštini.,true,sr,"'Since the beginning of the year, the government has not submitted any pro-European legislative proposals to the Assembly.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify whether the government has indeed submitted any pro-European legislative proposals to the Assembly since the beginning of the year. This would involve checking official records, legislative databases, or credible news sources for any such proposals.

Without access to this specific information, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified information, we can proceed with an evaluation.

If the government has not submitted any pro-European legislative proposals to the Assembly since the beginning of the year, the claim would be 'True'. If there have been some proposals but not many, it might be 'Mostly True'. If there have been a significant number of proposals, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on verified information:

"Более 4,5 млн граждан, оставшихся без временного дохода, получили помощь в размере 42 тысячи 500 тенге. На это было затрачено более 450 миллиардов тенге",true,ru,"More than 4.5 million citizens who were left without temporary income received assistance in the amount of 42,500 tenge. Over 450 billion tenge was spent on this.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The number of citizens who received assistance.
2. The total amount of money spent on this assistance.

The claim states:
- More than 4.5 million citizens received assistance.
- Each received 42,500 tenge.
- Over 450 billion tenge was spent in total.

Let's break it down:

1. **Number of Citizens and Amount per Citizen:**
   - If more than 4.5 million citizens received 42,500 tenge each, the total amount distributed can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     4,500,000 \text{ citizens} \times 42,500 \text{ tenge} = 191,250,000,000 \text{ tenge}
     \]
   - This calculation shows that if exactly 4.5 million citizens received 42,500 tenge each, the total would be 191.25 billion tenge.

2. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - The claim states that over 450 billion tenge was spent. For this to be true, the number of citizens receiving assistance would need to be significantly higher than 4.5 million, or the amount per citizen would need to be higher.

Given the discrepancy between the calculated total (191.25 billion tenge) and the claimed total expenditure (over 450 billion tenge), the numbers do not align. Therefore, the claim appears to be inaccurate.

"“A to što ljudi više kupuju vodu, zato što je to postala moda i ne veruju u našu česmovaču koja je inače odličnog kvaliteta, kao i flaširana voda.”",false,sr,"""And the fact that people are buying more water is because it has become a trend and they don't trust our tap water, which is otherwise of excellent quality, just like bottled water.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components:

1. ""People are buying more water because it has become a trend.""
2. ""People don't trust our tap water.""
3. ""Our tap water is of excellent quality, just like bottled water.""

1. **Trend of Buying Bottled Water**: It is widely recognized that the consumption of bottled water has increased over the years, and part of this increase can be attributed to trends and marketing efforts by bottled water companies. This part of the claim is generally supported by market research and consumer behavior studies.

2. **Trust in Tap Water**: There is a segment of the population that does not trust tap water, often due to concerns about contamination, taste, or safety. This distrust can be influenced by high-profile incidents of water contamination (e.g., Flint, Michigan) and general skepticism about municipal water systems.

3. **Quality of Tap Water**: In many developed countries, tap water is subject to stringent regulations and quality controls, making it safe and of high quality. However, the perception of quality can vary based on local issues and individual experiences. In some cases, bottled water is not significantly different in quality from tap water, and sometimes it is just tap water that has been filtered and bottled.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also generalizations that may not apply universally. Therefore, the most accurate classification would be:

1. Whether the University of Rennes in France exists.
2. Whether the University of Rennes is introducing a subject called ""Abaev Studies.""
3. What ""Abaev Studies"" entails and if it is a recognized academic subject.

Given that I do not have access to real-time data or specific announcements from the University of Rennes, I cannot confirm the introduction of a subject called ""Abaev Studies"" at this institution. 

Therefore, based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, I cannot verify this claim.

For comparison: each prisoner is allocated 3 square meters.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details mentioned:

1. **Nursery Room Requirement**: The claim states that since 2018, it is sufficient for a nursery to have just one room for children.
2. **Area per Child**: The claim mentions that the required area per child has been reduced to 2.25 square meters, and for nurseries and children's clubs operating up to 5 hours a day, it is 1.87 square meters.
3. **Comparison with Prisoners**: The claim compares this to the space allocated to prisoners, which is stated to be 3 square meters.

### Verification:

1. **Nursery Room Requirement**:
   - If regulations have indeed changed in 2018 to allow nurseries to operate with just one room, this part of the claim would be accurate.

2. **Area per Child**:
   - The specific figures of 2.25 square meters per child and 1.87 square meters for part-time nurseries need to be checked against official guidelines or regulations. If these figures are correct, this part of the claim would be accurate.

3. **Comparison with Prisoners**:
   - The space allocation for prisoners varies by country and specific regulations. In many places, the standard is around 3 square meters per prisoner, but this can vary.

### Conclusion:
- If all the specific details (one room requirement, area per child, and comparison with prisoners) are accurate based on official regulations and standards, the claim would be 'True'.
- If some details are slightly off but generally correct, it would be 'Mostly True'.
- If there are significant inaccuracies or missing context, it would be 'Half True' or lower.

1. **Tariffs and Prices**: Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. When tariffs are reduced or eliminated, the cost of importing these goods decreases. This reduction in cost can lead to lower prices for consumers, assuming that the savings are passed on by importers and retailers.

2. **Scope of Products**: The claim mentions a wide range of products, including cars, computers, technical goods, furniture, textiles, and many others. If tariffs are reduced across these categories, it is reasonable to expect that the prices of these goods could decrease.

3. **Market Dynamics**: While reduced tariffs can lead to lower prices, other factors such as supply chain costs, demand, and market competition also play a role in determining final consumer prices. Therefore, while the general trend might be towards lower prices, the extent of the reduction can vary.

4. **Specific Agreements**: The claim does not specify a particular trade agreement or context. However, if there is a specific trade agreement between a country and the EU that includes tariff reductions on a broad range of products, the claim would be more credible.

Given these considerations, the claim is generally accurate but may not account for all market dynamics that influence final prices.

This involves checking The Washington Post's publications or databases that list experimental COVID-19 vaccines.

1. **Check The Washington Post's List**: The Washington Post has published lists and articles about COVID-19 vaccines, including those in development. If the Kazakh vaccine is mentioned in such a list, the claim would be supported.

2. **Number of Vaccines**: The claim specifies a list of 200 promising vaccines. We need to confirm if The Washington Post has such a list and if the Kazakh vaccine is included.

3. **Promising and Experimental**: The claim also describes the vaccines as ""promising"" and ""experimental."" This means the vaccine should be in a developmental stage and considered potentially effective.

Without direct access to The Washington Post's specific list, we can look for secondary sources or databases that might have referenced this information. However, if we cannot find direct evidence from The Washington Post, we should be cautious in our assessment.

Given the information available and the need for precise verification from The Washington Post, the claim cannot be fully substantiated without direct evidence.

1. The state budget deficit during the PO-PSL government in 2010/11.
2. The current state budget deficit.
3. The trend of the state budget deficit in recent years.

1. **State Budget Deficit during PO-PSL Government in 2010/11:**
   - The PO-PSL (Civic Platform-Polish People's Party) coalition governed Poland from 2007 to 2015.
   - According to historical data, the budget deficit in 2010 was approximately 44.6 billion PLN, and in 2011 it was around 25.1 billion PLN. The claim of 100 billion PLN seems to be an exaggeration or a misrepresentation.

2. **Current State Budget Deficit:**
   - The claim states the current deficit is 28.5 billion PLN. This figure needs to be verified with the most recent budget reports. As of the latest available data, the deficit figures can vary, but assuming the claim is based on a recent official report, it could be accurate.

3. **Trend of the State Budget Deficit:**
   - The trend of the budget deficit in recent years has shown fluctuations, with some years having higher deficits and others lower. However, without specific data points for each year, it's challenging to definitively state the trend.

Given the discrepancy in the historical deficit figures during the PO-PSL government and the lack of precise trend data, the claim appears to be partially accurate but contains significant inaccuracies.

Polskie społeczeństwo starzeje się najszybciej w Europie.,false,pl,Polish society is aging the fastest in Europe.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Polish society is aging the fastest in Europe,"" we need to examine demographic data and trends related to aging populations across European countries.

1. **Population Aging Metrics**: The rate at which a society is aging can be measured by the increase in the median age of the population, the proportion of elderly people (typically those aged 65 and over), and the dependency ratio (the ratio of non-working age population to working-age population).

2. **Comparative Data**: According to Eurostat and other demographic studies, several European countries are experiencing significant aging trends. Countries like Germany, Italy, and Greece also have high proportions of elderly populations and are aging rapidly.

3. **Poland's Aging Rate**: Poland is indeed experiencing a rapid aging process due to low birth rates and increasing life expectancy. However, whether it is the fastest aging society in Europe is subject to comparison with other countries.

4. **Recent Studies and Reports**: Recent reports and studies should be consulted to provide the most up-to-date comparison. For instance, a 2021 Eurostat report might show that while Poland is aging quickly, other countries might be aging at a similar or faster rate.

Given the complexity and the need for precise comparative data, the claim that ""Polish society is aging the fastest in Europe"" might be an overstatement without specific, up-to-date comparative evidence.

Казахстан попал в ТОП-15 стран с наихудшими законами о доступе к информации,true,ru,Kazakhstan is among the top 15 countries with the worst access to information laws.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Kazakhstan is among the top 15 countries with the worst access to information laws,"" we need to refer to credible sources that rank countries based on their access to information laws. One such source is the Global Right to Information (RTI) Rating, which assesses the strength of access to information laws around the world.

As of the latest available data, Kazakhstan's access to information laws are indeed considered weak. According to the RTI Rating, Kazakhstan ranks poorly in terms of the legal framework for access to information. However, whether it is specifically among the ""top 15 worst"" can vary depending on the exact ranking and the number of countries evaluated.

Given that Kazakhstan is consistently ranked low but not necessarily always in the bottom 15 in every assessment, the claim can be considered somewhat accurate but not definitively precise.

Polacy są w tej chwili najbardziej gruntownie rozbrojonym narodem w Europie.,false,pl,The Poles are currently the most thoroughly disarmed nation in Europe.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Poles are currently the most thoroughly disarmed nation in Europe,"" we need to consider several factors, including the current state of military and civilian disarmament in Poland compared to other European nations.

1. **Military Disarmament**: Poland is a member of NATO and has an active military force. It participates in various NATO missions and has been modernizing its military capabilities. Therefore, it is not accurate to describe Poland as ""thoroughly disarmed"" in a military context.

2. **Civilian Disarmament**: When it comes to civilian gun ownership, Poland has relatively strict gun control laws compared to some other European countries. However, it is not the only country in Europe with stringent gun control. Countries like the United Kingdom, Japan, and others also have very strict regulations on civilian gun ownership.

Given these points, the claim that Poland is the ""most thoroughly disarmed nation in Europe"" does not hold up under scrutiny. Poland is neither the most disarmed in a military sense nor uniquely disarmed in a civilian context.

“Između 30 i 31 hiljade dinara je minimalac u Srbiji.”,true,sr,"""The minimum wage in Serbia is between 30 and 31 thousand dinars.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The minimum wage in Serbia is between 30 and 31 thousand dinars,"" we need to verify the most recent data on the minimum wage in Serbia.

As of the latest available information in 2023, the minimum wage in Serbia is set at 230 dinars per hour. Assuming a standard full-time work month of 160 hours (which is 40 hours per week), the calculation would be:

230 dinars/hour * 160 hours/month = 36,800 dinars/month.

Given this calculation, the claim that the minimum wage is between 30 and 31 thousand dinars is not accurate.

„Korupcija u zdravstvu je sporadična pojava.“,mostly false,sr,"""Corruption in healthcare is a sporadic occurrence.""","Corruption in healthcare is a significant issue that affects many countries around the world. It can manifest in various forms, such as bribery, embezzlement, fraud, and favoritism. The prevalence and impact of corruption in healthcare can vary widely depending on the country, the robustness of its institutions, and the effectiveness of its regulatory frameworks.

In some countries, corruption in healthcare may indeed be sporadic and not a widespread issue. However, in many other countries, corruption is a systemic problem that undermines the quality of care, increases costs, and erodes public trust in the healthcare system.

Given the variability in the prevalence of corruption in healthcare across different contexts, the claim that ""Corruption in healthcare is a sporadic occurrence"" is not universally accurate.

The Charter, adopted by the Council of Europe, sets out standards for protecting the rights of local authorities. Article 5 of the Charter states:

""Changes in local authority boundaries shall not be made without prior consultation of the local communities concerned, possibly by means of a referendum where this is permitted by statute.""

This means that while the Charter emphasizes the need for consultation with local communities, it does not mandate a referendum as the only method of consultation. A referendum is one possible method, but it is not explicitly required by the Charter.

Given this information, the claim that changing the voivodeship border without a referendum is inconsistent with the European Charter of Local Self-Government is not entirely accurate. The Charter requires consultation, but not necessarily a referendum.

This is a growth that has not been recorded before.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two key components:

1. **The salary in the national economy has increased by 20% over the last 2.5 years.**
2. **This is a growth that has not been recorded before.**

Without specific data on salary growth in the national economy over the last 2.5 years and historical salary growth records, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, we can consider the following:

- **Historical Context:** If there have been periods in the past where salary growth was higher than 20% over a similar timeframe, the claim would be inaccurate.
- **Recent Trends:** If recent data supports a 20% increase in salaries over the last 2.5 years, the first part of the claim could be true.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the historical uniqueness of this growth, the claim that ""This is a growth that has not been recorded before"" is speculative.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the need for historical data to fully validate the claim, the most appropriate classification would be:

"Największa liczba Polaków emigrowała w czasie rządów PiS- u, nawet 0,5 mln rocznie, dziś to jest 50-60 tysięcy, 8 razy mniej.",half true,pl,"The largest number of Poles emigrated during the rule of PiS, up to 0.5 million annually; today it is 50-60 thousand, 8 times less.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the emigration statistics from Poland during the rule of the Law and Justice party (PiS) and compare them to the current figures.

1. **Historical Emigration Data**: 
   - The Law and Justice party (PiS) has been in power in Poland during two main periods: 2005-2007 and from 2015 onwards.
   - According to various sources, including the Polish Central Statistical Office (GUS), the peak of Polish emigration occurred around the time Poland joined the European Union in 2004, with significant numbers continuing in the following years. However, the claim of 0.5 million annually during PiS rule needs specific verification.

2. **Current Emigration Data**:
   - Recent data from GUS and other sources indicate that the number of Poles emigrating has decreased in recent years. The figures of 50-60 thousand annually seem to align with the latest statistics.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - If we consider the peak emigration years around 2004-2007, the numbers were indeed high, but attributing 0.5 million annually specifically to the PiS rule without precise data is questionable.
   - The current figures of 50-60 thousand annually represent a significant decrease, but the claim of ""8 times less"" needs exact historical numbers to confirm.

Given the available data, the claim seems to mix accurate current figures with potentially exaggerated historical figures during PiS rule. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth.

"Разрешили завозить вакцины БЕЗ национальной экспертизы. Причем, через организации, рекомендованные ВОЗ.",half true,ru,"They allowed the import of vaccines WITHOUT national expertise. Moreover, through organizations recommended by the WHO.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""They allowed the import of vaccines WITHOUT national expertise.""
2. ""Moreover, through organizations recommended by the WHO.""

1. **Import of vaccines without national expertise:**
   - Many countries have regulatory bodies that assess the safety and efficacy of vaccines before they are approved for use. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries expedited the approval process for vaccines that had already been approved by reputable international bodies or other countries' regulatory agencies. This could be interpreted as relying less on national expertise and more on international validation.

2. **Through organizations recommended by the WHO:**
   - The World Health Organization (WHO) has a list of prequalified vaccines and recommends certain vaccines for emergency use. Many countries have relied on WHO recommendations to expedite the approval and importation of vaccines during the pandemic.

Given these points, the claim has elements of truth but lacks context. While it is true that some countries expedited vaccine approval processes and relied on WHO recommendations, it is not entirely accurate to say they did so ""without national expertise"" as national regulatory bodies still played a role, albeit in a more streamlined manner.

1. **Timing of the Statement**: The claim states that the speaker told the citizens of Serbia ""last year (2009)"" before the start of the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis is generally considered to have started in 2007-2008, with significant events like the collapse of Lehman Brothers occurring in September 2008.

2. **Content of the Statement**: The speaker claimed that the past year (2008) would be the hardest in recent history.

Given these points, the statement contains a discrepancy regarding the timing of the global financial crisis. The crisis had already started by 2008, so it would not be accurate to say that the statement was made before the start of the crisis if it was made in 2009.

The claim states that economic growth is expected to be between one to one and a half percent, which is more modest compared to previous growth rates of five to seven percent.

According to the World Bank and other economic data sources, the global economy did experience a recovery in 2010 following the financial crisis of 2008-2009. However, the growth rates varied significantly by country and region. For instance, the global GDP growth rate in 2010 was approximately 5.4%, but this figure includes high growth rates from emerging economies like China and India, which can skew the average.

For more specific data:
- The United States saw a GDP growth rate of about 2.6% in 2010.
- The Eurozone had a growth rate of around 2.0%.
- Japan's economy grew by about 4.2%.

Given that the claim does not specify a particular country or region, it is challenging to assess its accuracy without additional context. However, if we consider the global average, the claim of one to one and a half percent growth is significantly lower than the actual global growth rate of 5.4%.

"„Sve vreme je to (broj grla stoke) išlo silaznom putanjom, apsolutno sve vreme.“",false,sr,"""The number of livestock has been on a downward trend the entire time, absolutely the entire time.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The number of livestock has been on a downward trend the entire time, absolutely the entire time,"" we need to consider historical data on livestock populations. Livestock numbers can fluctuate due to various factors such as market demand, disease outbreaks, changes in farming practices, and environmental conditions.

If we look at long-term trends, it is often the case that livestock populations do not follow a consistent downward trend. For example, certain periods may see increases in livestock numbers due to favorable economic conditions or advancements in farming technology. Conversely, other periods may see declines due to disease outbreaks or economic downturns.

Given that livestock populations are subject to fluctuations and are influenced by a variety of factors, it is unlikely that the number of livestock has been on a consistent downward trend ""the entire time.""

Dean Koontz's novel ""The Eyes of Darkness,"" published in 1981, does mention a fictional virus called ""Wuhan-400."" However, the similarities between the fictional virus and the real COVID-19 are superficial and coincidental. The fictional virus in the book is a man-made biological weapon with a 100% fatality rate, which is vastly different from the real SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.

Paweł Adamowicz was a prominent Polish politician and the Mayor of Gdańsk. He was a member of the Civic Platform party for many years. However, in 2015, Adamowicz faced legal issues related to allegations of financial irregularities and discrepancies in his asset declarations. These legal troubles led to tensions between him and the Civic Platform party.

In 2018, Adamowicz decided to run for re-election as Mayor of Gdańsk as an independent candidate, rather than under the Civic Platform banner. This decision was influenced by the ongoing legal issues and the party's stance on his candidacy.

Given this context, the claim that ""Paweł Adamowicz (…) himself was a member of the party until the time when the Platform decided to part ways with him due to his legal issues"" is largely accurate. The Civic Platform distanced itself from Adamowicz due to his legal troubles, and he subsequently ran as an independent candidate.

1. Italy is the second foreign trade partner of Serbia after Germany.
2. Italy is the primary export destination for Serbian companies.

According to recent trade data, Germany is indeed Serbia's largest trade partner. Italy is also one of Serbia's significant trade partners, often ranking high in terms of both imports and exports. However, whether Italy is consistently the second-largest trade partner can vary based on the specific year and the metrics used (total trade volume, imports, or exports).

Regarding the primary export destination, Germany is typically the largest export market for Serbia, followed by Italy. This means that while Italy is a major export destination, it is usually not the primary one.

Given this information, the claim that Italy is the second foreign trade partner of Serbia after Germany is generally accurate, but the assertion that Italy is the primary export destination is not.

1. **Source of the Claim**: Identify who made the claim and in what context.
2. **Ombudsman's Reports**: Review the Ombudsman's reports to understand the specific irregularities and issues that were pointed out.
3. **Government Actions**: Examine the actions taken by the parliamentary majority and the government to address these issues.

1. The current minimum hourly rate in Poland.
2. The minimum hourly rate in Poland 5 years ago.
3. Whether the change in the minimum hourly rate is due to the president's signature on a bill.

As of 2023, the minimum hourly rate in Poland is indeed around 17 zł. Five years ago, in 2018, the minimum hourly rate was approximately 13.70 zł, not 5 zł. Additionally, changes in the minimum wage in Poland are typically enacted by the government and not solely by the president's signature.

Given these points, the claim contains some inaccuracies:

- The current minimum hourly rate is correctly stated as 17 zł.
- The minimum hourly rate 5 years ago was not 5 zł but closer to 13.70 zł.
- The process of changing the minimum wage involves more than just the president's signature.

1. **Geographical and Logistical Factors**: Serbia is a landlocked country, which means it does not have direct access to the sea. This would make the logistics of importing fish from the northern seas more complex and potentially more expensive compared to coastal countries.

2. **Existing Infrastructure**: Serbia would need to have or develop significant infrastructure for fish processing, including facilities, technology, and skilled labor. This would require substantial investment and time.

3. **Market Competition**: The European fish processing market is already competitive, with established players from countries with direct access to the sea, such as Norway, Iceland, and other EU countries. Competing with these established industries would be challenging.

4. **Regulatory and Trade Considerations**: Serbia would need to navigate EU regulations and standards for food processing and trade. While not insurmountable, this adds another layer of complexity.

5. **Economic Viability**: The economic viability of importing fish, processing it, and then exporting it back to European markets would need to be carefully analyzed. Factors such as cost of import, processing, and export, as well as market demand and pricing, would play crucial roles.

Given these considerations, while it is theoretically possible for Serbia to develop a niche in fish processing, the claim that it could become a ""European power"" in this field seems overly optimistic and does not fully account for the significant challenges and competition involved.

1. **Context**: The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 had a significant impact on economies worldwide. By March 2009, many economies were experiencing severe downturns.

2. **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators typically include GDP growth, unemployment rates, stock market performance, consumer confidence, and industrial production.

3. **Recovery Signs**: 
   - **Stock Markets**: Many stock markets, including the S&P 500, hit their lowest points in March 2009 and began to recover afterward.

   - **Unemployment**: Unemployment rates remained high for a longer period, even as other indicators began to improve.
   - **Consumer Confidence**: Consumer confidence started to improve gradually after March 2009.
   - **Industrial Production**: Industrial production showed signs of recovery in some regions.

4. **Analysis**: While several key indicators did show signs of recovery starting around March 2009, not all indicators improved uniformly or immediately.

Wie pan ile w rządzie zasiada osób? 106 wiceministrów i 22 chyba ministrów.,false,pl,How many people are in the government? 106 deputy ministers and probably 22 ministers.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the typical structure of a government, specifically the number of deputy ministers and ministers.

1. **Ministers**: In many countries, the number of ministers can vary, but 22 is a plausible number for a cabinet. For example, the United Kingdom has around 20-25 ministers in the cabinet, and the United States has 15 executive departments with additional cabinet-level positions.

2. **Deputy Ministers**: The number of deputy ministers can also vary widely depending on the country and its governmental structure. Some countries have a large number of deputy ministers, while others have fewer. The claim of 106 deputy ministers is plausible but would need specific verification for the country in question.

Given that the claim provides a specific number of deputy ministers (106) and an approximate number of ministers (22), and considering that these numbers are within a plausible range for many governments, the claim can be considered reasonably accurate but not definitively verified without more specific context.

The fascists received 8% of the votes.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down and verify each part of the statement:

1. **LSNS openly refers to the regime created by the Nazi collaborator Father Tiso**: The LSNS (Ľudová strana Naše Slovensko or People's Party Our Slovakia) has been known to express admiration for Jozef Tiso, the leader of the Slovak State during World War II, which was a Nazi puppet state.

2. **Calls for violence**: The LSNS has been associated with rhetoric that can be interpreted as inciting violence, although direct calls for violence may not be explicitly documented in all cases.

3. **Organizes militias**: The LSNS has been linked to the organization of paramilitary groups, such as the Slovak Conscripts, which have been involved in activities resembling militia training.

4. **The fascists received 8% of the votes**: In the 2016 Slovak parliamentary elections, the LSNS received around 8% of the vote, which allowed them to enter the National Council.

Given this information, the claim appears to be largely accurate but may slightly overstate the explicitness of calls for violence.

Коронавирус вызывает не пневмонию а тромбоз,false,ru,"Coronavirus causes thrombosis, not pneumonia.","The claim ""Coronavirus causes thrombosis, not pneumonia"" is misleading. COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, can lead to a variety of complications, including both pneumonia and thrombosis. Pneumonia is a common and well-documented complication of COVID-19, characterized by inflammation of the lungs which can lead to severe respiratory issues. Thrombosis, which involves the formation of blood clots, has also been observed in COVID-19 patients and can lead to serious conditions such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.

Therefore, the claim that coronavirus causes thrombosis but not pneumonia is incorrect because it oversimplifies the range of complications associated with the virus.

1. **Check the Doing Business report for the previous year**: Look at the ranking for Kazakhstan in the ""Obtaining a construction permit"" category.
2. **Compare the rankings**: Verify if Kazakhstan indeed rose by 17 positions and if it ranked 35th in the world.

Without access to the specific Doing Business report data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and based on the World Bank's Doing Business report, the claim would be evaluated as follows:

- If Kazakhstan did rise by 17 positions and ranked 35th, the claim is 'True'.
- If there is a slight discrepancy in the number of positions or the final rank, it could be 'Mostly True'.
- If the rise or rank is significantly different, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

В нескольких городах США планируется расформировать полицию и заменить ее командами реагирования,half true,ru,"In several cities in the USA, there are plans to disband the police and replace them with response teams.","The claim that ""In several cities in the USA, there are plans to disband the police and replace them with response teams"" is a bit nuanced and requires context. 

In the wake of the George Floyd protests in 2020, some cities in the USA did discuss and implement changes to their policing strategies. For example, Minneapolis City Council initially pledged to dismantle the police department and replace it with a new model of public safety. However, the term ""disband"" can be misleading as it suggests a complete elimination of police forces, which is not entirely accurate. Instead, many of these plans involve restructuring, reallocating funds, and integrating alternative response teams for specific types of incidents, such as mental health crises.

Therefore, while there have been discussions and some actions towards significant changes in policing, the idea of completely disbanding police departments and replacing them solely with response teams is not a widespread or fully realized practice.

The Balkans typically include countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia. 

As of the most recent data available, the unemployment rates in these countries are generally lower than 25%. For instance:
- Albania: Around 11-12%
- Bosnia and Herzegovina: Around 15-16%
- Bulgaria: Around 5-6%
- Croatia: Around 7-8%
- Greece: Around 12-13%

- Montenegro: Around 15-16%
- North Macedonia: Around 16-17%
- Romania: Around 5-6%
- Serbia: Around 9-10%
- Slovenia: Around 4-5%

From this data, it is evident that Kosovo has an unemployment rate that can reach or exceed 25%, which contradicts the claim.

Dopiero teraz wiemy ilu lekarzy pracuje w Polsce. Jest to 149 tys. mniej więcej. To jest średnia europejska.,false,pl,Only now do we know how many doctors work in Poland. It is approximately 149 thousand. This is the European average.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points: the number of doctors in Poland and how this number compares to the European average.

1. **Number of Doctors in Poland**: According to the latest data from the OECD and other reliable sources, Poland has approximately 149,000 doctors. This figure can vary slightly depending on the source and the year of the data, but it is generally in this range.

2. **European Average**: The European average for the number of doctors per capita is typically measured in terms of doctors per 1,000 inhabitants. According to the OECD, the average number of doctors per 1,000 inhabitants in Europe is around 3.6. Poland has about 3.4 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants, which is slightly below the European average but still within a close range.

Given this information, the claim that Poland has approximately 149,000 doctors is accurate. However, stating that this is the European average is somewhat misleading because the average is usually expressed per capita, not in absolute numbers. Poland's per capita number of doctors is slightly below the European average.

1. **Existence of UPR**: The UPR (Unia Polityki Realnej) was a political party in Poland.
2. **Collection of Signatures**: Whether the UPR collected 140,000 signatures for a bill to introduce the death penalty.
3. **Action by the Sejm**: Whether these signatures were ""shredded"" or otherwise dismissed by the Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament).

**Step-by-Step Verification**:

1. **Existence of UPR**: The UPR was indeed a political party in Poland, active particularly in the 1990s and early 2000s.
2. **Collection of Signatures**: There are historical records and news articles indicating that the UPR did campaign for the reintroduction of the death penalty and collected signatures for this cause.
3. **Action by the Sejm**: The term ""shredded"" is likely used metaphorically to indicate that the proposal was dismissed or not taken up for serious consideration by the Sejm. There is no specific evidence that the physical signatures were literally shredded, but it is plausible that the proposal was rejected or ignored.

Given the information, the claim seems to be based on real events, but the use of the word ""shredded"" might be an exaggeration or metaphorical.

"Ile było głosów nieważnych, teraz w wyborach prezydenckich? 1%?",true,pl,How many invalid votes were there in the presidential election? 1%?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""1% of the votes in the presidential election were invalid,"" we need to consider the context and available data from recent presidential elections. The percentage of invalid votes can vary significantly depending on the country, the specific election, and the year.

For example, in the United States, the percentage of invalid votes (which includes spoiled, blank, or otherwise uncountable ballots) in presidential elections is typically less than 1%. According to data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the rate of invalid ballots in recent U.S. presidential elections has generally been below 1%.

However, in other countries, the rate of invalid votes can be higher or lower depending on various factors such as the voting system, voter education, and election administration.

Without specific details about the country and the particular election in question, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we consider the context of the United States, the claim that 1% of the votes were invalid is generally consistent with available data.

1. The conversion rate between dinars and euros.
2. The average salaries in the region for comparison.

Let's break it down:

1. **Conversion Rate**: 
   - If 34,000 to 35,000 dinars is equivalent to 320 to 330 euros, we can calculate the implied exchange rate.
   - 34,000 dinars / 320 euros = 106.25 dinars per euro.
   - 35,000 dinars / 330 euros = 106.06 dinars per euro.
   - The exchange rate is approximately 106.06 to 106.25 dinars per euro.

2. **Regional Salary Comparison**:
   - To verify if the average salaries are on par with the region, we need data on average salaries in neighboring countries or similar economies.
   - If the average salaries in the region are indeed around 320 to 330 euros, the claim would be accurate.

Without specific data on regional salaries, we can only assess the internal consistency of the claim. The conversion rate seems reasonable, but without regional salary data, we can't fully verify the comparison.

Given the information provided and assuming the conversion rate is accurate, the claim appears internally consistent but lacks external verification.

1. The fishing industry of Kazakhstan during the Soviet period was highly developed and profitable, with a gross fish production volume exceeding 80 thousand tons per year.
2. The current total volume of bioresource extraction has decreased several times compared to the Soviet period.

**Verification:**

1. **Historical Context:**
   - During the Soviet period, Kazakhstan indeed had a well-developed fishing industry. The Caspian Sea and various inland water bodies were significant sources of fish. Historical records and various sources confirm that the fishing industry was a notable part of the economy.
   - The claim of a gross fish production volume exceeding 80 thousand tons per year is consistent with historical data from the Soviet era, which indicates that Kazakhstan's fishing industry was substantial.

2. **Current Context:**
   - Post-Soviet Union, Kazakhstan's fishing industry has faced numerous challenges, including environmental degradation, overfishing, and economic transitions. These factors have led to a significant decline in fish production.
   - Recent data and reports indicate that the current volume of bioresource extraction is indeed much lower than during the Soviet period. The decline is attributed to various factors, including reduced fish stocks and changes in economic priorities.

Given the historical and current context, the claim appears to be accurate.

Iceland is often cited as having one of the smallest gender pay gaps in the world. Luxembourg and Belgium also tend to have relatively small gender pay gaps compared to other countries. Greece, however, does not consistently rank among the countries with the smallest gender pay gaps.

1. **Data from EU Agencies**: The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and Eurostat provide statistics on asylum applications and their outcomes. Reviewing their latest reports would give insight into the trends of asylum applications from Serbia.

2. **Trends Over Time**: If the data shows a consistent decrease in the number of asylum applications from Serbian nationals that are deemed unfounded or rejected over recent years, this would support the claim.

3. **Contextual Factors**: Consider any policy changes, agreements between the EU and Serbia, or other factors that might influence the number of asylum seekers and the outcomes of their applications.

Without specific data at hand, we can only hypothesize based on general trends and reports. However, if recent reports indicate a decrease in the number of unfounded asylum applications from Serbia, the claim would be supported.

**Hypothetical Example**:
- If EASO reports show a 20% decrease in unfounded asylum applications from Serbian nationals over the past two years, the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- If the decrease is less significant or inconsistent, it might be 'Half True'.

The claim suggests that the SNS lacks a clear policy, idea, ideology, and program.

1. **Policy**: Political parties typically have policies, even if they are not well-publicized or coherent. The SNS, as a major political party in Serbia, would have policies on various issues, even if they are not always clear or consistent.

2. **Idea and Ideology**: While the SNS may not have a rigid or traditional ideological framework, it does have guiding principles and positions on various issues. It is often described as center-right and has been associated with populist and nationalist rhetoric.

3. **Program**: Political parties usually have some form of a program or platform, even if it is not detailed or comprehensive. The SNS has had electoral programs and platforms in the past, outlining their goals and priorities.

Given these points, the claim that the SNS ""doesn't have any"" policy, idea, ideology, or program is an exaggeration. While there may be criticisms about the clarity or consistency of these elements, it is not accurate to say they are entirely absent.

3. **Three-Wheeled Bicycles**: The claim specifically mentions three-wheeled bicycles designed for people with disabilities and seniors.

If the Veturilo system indeed includes a limited number of three-wheeled bicycles for these groups, the claim would be accurate. However, if there are no such bicycles or if the number is significantly different from what is implied, the claim's accuracy would be affected.

1. **Role of the CJEU**: The CJEU interprets EU law to ensure it is applied uniformly across all EU member states. It has the authority to rule on whether national laws are consistent with EU law.

2. **EU Law Supremacy**: EU law takes precedence over national laws, including national constitutions, in areas where the EU has competence. This principle is established to ensure the uniform application and effectiveness of EU law.

3. **National Constitutions**: While the CJEU can determine if national laws, including constitutional provisions, are inconsistent with EU law, it does not have the authority to directly rule on the constitutionality of national laws within the context of the national legal system. Instead, it can declare that a national law is incompatible with EU law, which then requires the member state to resolve the inconsistency.

Given these points, the CJEU can point out that a national law, including one derived from a national constitution, is inconsistent with EU law. However, it does not have the jurisdiction to declare a national law inconsistent with the national constitution itself; that is the role of national courts.

2. **Vaccination Rates**:

For COVID-19, the vaccination rate has been higher than 75% for at least the first dose.
   - **Switzerland**: Similarly, the vaccination rate for common vaccines in Switzerland is high but not exactly 75%. For COVID-19, the rate has also been higher than 75% for at least the first dose.
   - **Poland**: The claim that Poland has a 99.99% vaccination rate is highly exaggerated. While Poland has high vaccination rates for many vaccines, it is not 99.99%. For COVID-19, the vaccination rate is significantly lower than 99.99%.

They developed twice as slowly as we [Poland] did,"" we need to examine the economic growth rates of Hungary (where Budapest is the capital) and Poland over a relevant period.

1. **Economic Growth Rates**: 
   - According to World Bank data, Poland's GDP growth rate has generally been higher than Hungary's over the past few decades. For instance, between 2000 and 2020, Poland's average annual GDP growth rate was around 3.8%, while Hungary's was approximately 2.5%.
   
2. **Economic Context**:
   - Poland has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union, benefiting from structural reforms, EU membership, and a diversified economy.
   - Hungary has also experienced growth but has faced more economic volatility and political challenges that have sometimes hindered its growth.

3. **Twice as Slow**:
   - The claim that Hungary developed ""twice as slowly"" as Poland is an exaggeration. While Poland's growth has been faster, it is not accurate to say Hungary's growth rate is half of Poland's. The difference is significant but not to the extent of being twice as slow.

Given this context, the claim contains a kernel of truth regarding the relative economic growth rates but exaggerates the extent of the difference.

In June 2020, Gordon Klein, a lecturer at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, was placed on leave after he refused a request to provide special accommodations for African American students in the wake of George Floyd's death and the subsequent protests. The request was for flexibility in final exams and projects due to the emotional and mental toll on African American students. Klein's response to the request was perceived by some as dismissive and insensitive, leading to backlash and his temporary suspension.

However, it is important to note that the suspension was not solely because he refused to reschedule exams but also due to the manner in which he responded to the request, which was seen as inappropriate by some students and faculty members.

The claim includes several components:

1. Brammertz does not doubt the political will.
2. Brammertz has no professional objections to what is being done operationally.
3. Full cooperation with the Tribunal has been achieved regarding witnesses.
4. Full cooperation with the Tribunal has been achieved regarding the delivery of documentation.
5. Full cooperation with the Tribunal has been achieved regarding access to archives.

To verify these points, we would need access to Brammertz's statements or reports that confirm or deny these specific claims. Without direct access to such sources, we can only assess the claim based on general knowledge and context.

Given that Brammertz has often commented on the cooperation of various entities with the ICTY, and assuming the claim is based on a specific context where he has made such statements, it is plausible that the claim could be accurate. However, without concrete evidence or direct quotes from Brammertz, we cannot definitively confirm each component of the claim.

"„Ne može jedan državni sekretar, pa makar to bio i Slobodan Ilić, da napravi problem u odnosima u koaliciji.“",mostly false,sr,"""One state secretary, even if it is Slobodan Ilić, cannot create a problem in the coalition's relations.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and the potential influence of a state secretary within a coalition government. A state secretary, depending on the political system and the specific coalition dynamics, can have varying degrees of influence. 

1. **True**: This would mean that a state secretary, regardless of who it is, has no capacity to create problems in coalition relations.
2. **Mostly True**: This would suggest that generally, a state secretary does not have the power to create significant problems in coalition relations, but there might be rare exceptions.
3. **Half True**: This would indicate that a state secretary might sometimes create problems in coalition relations, but it is not a common occurrence.
4. **Mostly False**: This would imply that a state secretary often has the potential to create problems in coalition relations, but there might be some situations where they do not.
5. **False**: This would mean that a state secretary frequently has the capacity to create problems in coalition relations.

Given that state secretaries can have significant influence, especially if they hold key positions or have strong political backing, it is not accurate to categorically state that they cannot create problems in coalition relations. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

"То, что эпидемиологи не верили в сезонность коронавируса, привело к составлению неверных моделей и прогнозов. Когда первоначальные наихудшие сценарии нигде не сбылись, некоторые все еще цепляются за модели, предсказывающие вторую волну.",false,ru,"The fact that epidemiologists did not believe in the seasonality of the coronavirus led to the creation of incorrect models and forecasts. When the initial worst-case scenarios did not materialize anywhere, some still cling to models predicting a second wave.","To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components and assess the accuracy of each part:

1. **Epidemiologists and Seasonality**: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there was uncertainty about the seasonality of the virus. Some epidemiologists did consider the possibility of seasonality, but there was no consensus due to the novel nature of the virus and lack of sufficient data. Over time, evidence has suggested that while seasonality might play a role, it is not as significant as it is for other respiratory viruses like the flu.

2. **Incorrect Models and Forecasts**: Early models and forecasts were based on limited data and had to account for many unknowns, including the virus's transmission dynamics, public health interventions, and population behavior. Some models did overestimate the impact, but this was often due to the precautionary principle and the need to prepare for worst-case scenarios.

3. **Initial Worst-Case Scenarios**: In many places, the worst-case scenarios did not materialize, partly due to effective public health measures like lockdowns, social distancing, and mask-wearing. However, this does not mean the models were entirely incorrect; rather, the interventions helped mitigate the potential impact.

4. **Second Wave Predictions**: The concept of a second wave was based on historical patterns of pandemics and the understanding that pandemics can have multiple waves. Some regions did experience subsequent waves of COVID-19 infections, validating the concerns of epidemiologists.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also oversimplifies and misrepresents the complexity of the situation. The statement that epidemiologists did not believe in seasonality is not entirely accurate, and the assertion that incorrect models were solely due to this belief is misleading. Additionally, the prediction of a second wave was based on reasonable epidemiological principles and did occur in many places.

The claim describes a system known as ""presumed consent"" or ""opt-out"" organ donation, where individuals are considered organ donors unless they explicitly state otherwise.

1. **Presumed Consent Systems**: Many countries have adopted presumed consent systems to increase the availability of organs for transplantation. In these systems, individuals are automatically considered organ donors unless they opt out.

2. **Public Opinion**: The claim mentions that ""the people were against it,"" which suggests there was public opposition to the policy. Public opinion can vary widely, and while some may oppose presumed consent, others may support it. This aspect of the claim is more subjective and harder to verify without specific polling data.

3. **Opt-Out Mechanism**: The claim correctly describes the mechanism of opting out, either by the individual during their lifetime or by their relatives after death.

Given that presumed consent systems do exist and the description of the opt-out mechanism is accurate, but the statement about public opposition is more subjective and not universally applicable, the claim can be considered mostly accurate with some nuances.

1. **Government Priorities**: Infrastructure projects, such as highways, are often prioritized by governments for various reasons, including economic development, improving transportation networks, and supporting local industries.

2. **Fiat's Presence in Kragujevac**: Fiat has a significant manufacturing plant in Kragujevac, Serbia. The presence of a major automotive manufacturer can indeed influence government decisions to improve infrastructure to support the industry, facilitate logistics, and attract further investment.

3. **Statements and Reports**: If there are official statements or reports from the Serbian government or credible sources indicating that the highway project is prioritized due to the Fiat contract, this would support the claim.

Given the context that Fiat's operations in Kragujevac are substantial and that infrastructure improvements can be crucial for such large-scale industrial operations, it is reasonable to infer that the highway could be a priority for the government partly due to the Fiat contract.

1. **Listened to in Poland**: This implies that the data from the black box was analyzed or reviewed in Poland.
2. **Brought to Poland**: This means the physical black box was transported to Poland.
3. **In Polish hands**: This suggests that the black box is currently under the control of Polish authorities.

Without specific details about the incident or the black box in question, it's challenging to verify each part of the claim definitively. However, if we assume the context is related to a well-known event such as the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash, we can provide a more informed analysis:

- The black boxes from the 2010 crash were initially analyzed in Russia, not Poland.
- They were later shared with Polish investigators, but the original black boxes remained in Russia.
- Copies of the data were provided to Poland, but the physical black boxes were not brought to Poland.

Given this context, the claim would be:

1. **Listened to in Poland**: Partially true, as Polish investigators had access to the data.
2. **Brought to Poland**: False, as the physical black boxes remained in Russia.
3. **In Polish hands**: False, as the original black boxes were not in Polish possession.

Therefore, the overall claim is not accurate.

1. **National Debt**: According to the latest available data, Kazakhstan's external debt is approximately $160 billion.

2. **Population**: Kazakhstan's population is around 19 million people.

To find the per capita debt, we divide the total external debt by the population:

\[ \text{Per capita debt} = \frac{\text{Total external debt}}{\text{Population}} \]

\[ \text{Per capita debt} = \frac{160,000,000,000}{19,000,000} \approx 8,421 \]

This calculation shows that the per capita debt is approximately $8,421, which is close to the $9,000 mentioned in the claim.

Given this information, the claim is largely accurate but slightly overstated.

According to the Agency for Strategic Planning and Reforms of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the number of divorces in Kazakhstan in recent years has varied. For instance, in 2020, there were approximately 48,000 divorces. If we divide this annual figure by 365 days, we get an average of about 131 divorces per day (48,000 / 365 ≈ 131).

Given this information, the claim that 150 couples get divorced every day in Kazakhstan is somewhat close to the actual average but slightly higher than the reported figure.

1. **Priests' Taxation**: In Poland, priests are subject to a specific form of taxation. They often pay a flat-rate tax, which can vary depending on their role and the size of the parish. The amount of 243 PLN quarterly could be accurate for some priests, but it may not apply universally to all priests in Poland.

2. **Average Taxpayer's Taxation**: The average taxpayer in Poland pays Personal Income Tax (PIT), which is progressive and depends on their income level. The claim that the average taxpayer pays 2500 PLN quarterly in PIT would mean an annual tax of 10,000 PLN. This figure could be a reasonable average, but it would vary significantly based on individual incomes.

Given these points, the claim seems to have a basis in reality but may not be entirely accurate for all cases. The flat tax for priests and the average PIT for taxpayers can vary.

The claim suggests that restoring pensions to a previous level, as demanded by the IMF and some people, would result in reducing pensions for 80 percent of pensioners. It also states that simply repealing the law would not be feasible because it would lead to pension reductions.

To evaluate this, we would need to consider:
1. The specific demands of the IMF regarding pension levels.
2. The current pension structure and how it compares to the previous levels.
3. The impact of repealing the law on the pension amounts for the majority of pensioners.

Without detailed data on these points, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the speaker has accurate information about the pension system and the IMF's demands, the claim could be plausible. The statement acknowledges the complexity of pension adjustments and the potential negative impact on a large portion of pensioners.

Given the lack of specific data to fully confirm or refute the claim, but considering the logical consistency of the argument presented, the claim appears to be reasonably accurate but not fully verifiable.

However, Zoom has since made significant efforts to address these issues by implementing stronger security measures, such as end-to-end encryption for meetings, improved meeting controls, and regular updates to enhance security.

2. **Conversion Rates**: There is no substantial evidence or reliable data indicating a significant or large-scale conversion of Italians to Islam. While individual conversions do occur, they are not happening ""en masse.""

3. **Media and Reports**: Most reports and studies on religious demographics in Italy do not support the claim of mass conversions to Islam. The term ""en masse"" implies a large-scale movement, which is not reflected in the available data.

The United Left (Zjednoczona Lewica) was a coalition of left-wing parties that also participated in the 2015 elections. However, the United Left received 7.6% of the vote but did not secure any seats in the Sejm because they failed to surpass the 8% threshold required for coalitions to enter the parliament.

- The correction that it was never below 16, 17 million euros implies that the initial figure of 130,000 was incorrect.

Given the information provided, the claim seems to suggest a significant discrepancy between the initial and corrected figures. If the airport's profitability was never below 16-17 million euros, the statement about 130,000 in profit would be false.

1. ""We are responsible"" - This is a subjective statement and can vary based on context. It could imply that the speaker believes they or their group are acting responsibly, but without additional context, it's difficult to verify.

2. ""There is no reason for us to worry about visa liberalization"" - This is a more specific claim. Visa liberalization typically involves the relaxation of visa requirements between countries, which can have various implications depending on the political, economic, and social context. Whether there is a reason to worry about it would depend on specific circumstances such as the countries involved, the current state of international relations, and the potential impacts on security, economy, and migration.

Without additional context or evidence to support or refute these statements, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given the subjective nature of the first part and the conditional nature of the second part, the claim can be seen as partially accurate but not fully verifiable.

"Разрешили ставить психиатрические диагнозы на основе РАЗМЫТЫХ критериев. А слова «в соответствии с клиническими проявлениями, лабораторными данными, объективными сведениями» УБРАЛИ.

And the words ""in accordance with clinical manifestations, laboratory data, objective information"" were REMOVED. (In essence, this means that ANY person can now be diagnosed as mentally ill. And there is a possibility to use psychiatry for punitive purposes).","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the context and specifics of psychiatric diagnostic criteria and any recent changes to them. 

1. **Psychiatric Diagnoses and Criteria**: Psychiatric diagnoses are typically based on established criteria found in manuals such as the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) or the ICD-10/11 (International Classification of Diseases). These criteria are developed through extensive research and clinical consensus.

2. **Vague Criteria**: The claim suggests that the criteria have become vague. However, the DSM-5 and ICD-10/11 are known for their detailed and specific criteria for each mental disorder. While there is always some level of subjectivity in psychiatric diagnosis, the criteria are designed to minimize this.

3. **Removal of Specific Terms**: The claim states that terms like ""in accordance with clinical manifestations, laboratory data, objective information"" were removed. This would be a significant change, but there is no widely recognized evidence or documentation indicating that such a change has occurred in the major diagnostic manuals.

4. **Potential for Misuse**: The concern about psychiatry being used for punitive purposes is not new and has historical precedents. However, the established diagnostic criteria are intended to prevent such misuse by requiring specific symptoms and evidence.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim that diagnostic criteria have become vague and that specific terms have been removed, the claim appears to be largely unfounded.

We don't have commercials. Whichever of your portals you open, you'll see other candidates popping up.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several aspects:

1. **Spending on the campaign**: The claim states that no dinar has been spent on the campaign. This would require financial records or credible reports confirming zero expenditure.

2. **Rallies and participation**: The claim asserts that no rallies are held and there is no participation until elections are announced. This can be verified through event records, news reports, or public statements.

3. **Commercials**: The claim mentions the absence of commercials. This can be checked by reviewing media buys, advertising records, or monitoring media channels.

4. **Presence on portals**: The claim suggests that other candidates are visible on various portals, implying a lack of presence for the claimant. This can be verified by checking the mentioned portals for the presence or absence of the claimant's campaign materials.

Without specific evidence to confirm or refute these points, the claim cannot be fully validated. However, if we assume the claim is made in good faith and there is no contradictory evidence, it could be considered 'Mostly True' as it covers multiple aspects of campaign activities.

Miasto wspomaga (…) [schronisko Na Paluchu – przyp. red.] kwotą ok. 9 milionów złotych.,true,pl,The city supports the Na Paluchu shelter with an amount of approximately 9 million zlotys.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The city supports the Na Paluchu shelter with an amount of approximately 9 million zlotys,"" we would need to verify the actual financial support provided by the city to the Na Paluchu shelter. This would typically involve checking official city budget documents, statements from city officials, or credible news sources that report on the funding of the shelter.

Without access to specific and up-to-date information, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable source or recent data, we can make an educated guess.

Given the phrasing ""approximately 9 million zlotys,"" it suggests that the figure might not be exact but is close to the actual amount. If the actual support is within a reasonable range of 9 million zlotys, the claim would be considered accurate.

"Warto pamiętać, że już teraz 40 tysięcy osób rocznie umiera przedwcześnie z powodu zanieczyszczenia.",true,pl,"It is worth remembering that already 40,000 people die prematurely each year due to pollution.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""40,000 people die prematurely each year due to pollution,"" we need to consider the context and available data on pollution-related deaths.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other reputable sources, air pollution is a significant health risk that contributes to millions of premature deaths globally each year. For instance, the WHO estimates that around 7 million people die prematurely each year due to air pollution, which includes both outdoor and indoor air pollution.

Given this context, the figure of 40,000 premature deaths annually due to pollution is significantly lower than the global estimates provided by major health organizations. However, it is possible that the claim refers to a specific region or country rather than the global context. Without additional context specifying the region, the claim appears to understate the global impact of pollution on premature deaths.

"Za Hitlera był zakaz aborcji, za Stalina był zakaz aborcji.",half true,pl,"During Hitler's time, there was a ban on abortion; during Stalin's time, there was a ban on abortion.","To evaluate the claim, we need to look at the historical context of abortion laws during the regimes of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany and Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union.

1. **Nazi Germany (Hitler's time):**
   - In 1933, the Nazi regime implemented strict anti-abortion laws. Abortion was largely prohibited, especially for Aryan women, as part of the regime's focus on increasing the birth rate of the ""racially pure"" population. However, abortions were permitted and even encouraged for those deemed ""racially inferior"" or those with hereditary diseases.

2. **Soviet Union (Stalin's time):**
   - Initially, the Soviet Union under Lenin had liberal abortion laws, legalizing it in 1920. However, in 1936, under Stalin, the Soviet government reversed this policy and banned abortions to increase the birth rate. This ban remained in place until after Stalin's death, when the laws were relaxed again in 1955.

Given this historical context, the claim that there was a ban on abortion during both Hitler's and Stalin's times is accurate, though it is important to note the specific nuances and motivations behind these bans.

"„Dinar je među najstabilnijim valutama, ne samo u regionu, nego i u Evropi.“",mostly false,sr,"""The dinar is among the most stable currencies, not only in the region but also in Europe.""","To evaluate the claim that ""The dinar is among the most stable currencies, not only in the region but also in Europe,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Currency Stability**: Currency stability is typically measured by its exchange rate volatility, inflation rate, and economic policies of the issuing country.

2. **Regional Context**: The term ""region"" could refer to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where several countries use the dinar (e.g., Jordan, Kuwait, Iraq, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya).

3. **European Context**: Comparing the dinar to European currencies, particularly the Euro, which is widely considered stable, and other strong currencies like the Swiss Franc, British Pound, and Norwegian Krone.

### Analysis:

- **Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD)**: Known for its high value and relative stability due to Kuwait's substantial oil reserves and prudent fiscal policies.
- **Jordanian Dinar (JOD)**: Pegged to the US Dollar, providing stability, but the country's economic challenges can affect long-term stability.
- **Other Dinars**: Currencies like the Iraqi Dinar (IQD) and Libyan Dinar (LYD) have faced significant instability due to political and economic turmoil.

### Comparison with European Currencies:
- **Euro (EUR)**: Backed by the European Central Bank and used by multiple economically strong countries.
- **Swiss Franc (CHF)**: Known for its stability and safe-haven status.
- **British Pound (GBP)**: Historically stable, though subject to fluctuations due to political events like Brexit.

### Conclusion:
While some dinars, particularly the Kuwaiti Dinar, are relatively stable within their regional context, they generally do not match the stability of major European currencies like the Euro or Swiss Franc. Therefore, the claim overstates the stability of the dinar when compared to European currencies.

The claim suggests that the loan in question is unprecedented in its favorability compared to all previous loans from Serbia's numerous friends.

1. **Context and Specifics**: Without specific details about the loan (such as interest rates, repayment terms, and other conditions), it's challenging to make a precise comparison. However, if the loan indeed has exceptionally favorable terms, this could support the claim.

2. **Historical Comparison**: Serbia has received various loans and financial aid packages from international organizations (like the IMF, World Bank, and EU) and countries. Each of these loans would have had different terms and conditions. To verify the claim, one would need to compare the terms of the current loan with those of past loans.

3. **Source Credibility**: The credibility of the person making the claim and their access to comprehensive information about all past loans is also a factor. If the statement comes from a high-ranking official with access to detailed financial records, it might carry more weight.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim and the need for a thorough comparison with all past loans, it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim without further information. However, assuming the speaker is knowledgeable and the loan terms are indeed exceptionally favorable, the claim could be considered mostly true.

Появился еще один вид коронавируса,half true,ru,Another type of coronavirus has emerged.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Another type of coronavirus has emerged,"" we need to consider the context and the current state of knowledge about coronaviruses.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). The most recent and widely known coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.

New variants and types of coronaviruses can and do emerge over time. For example, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, other coronaviruses can be discovered in animal populations and potentially spill over to humans.

Given the ongoing nature of viral evolution and the discovery of new variants or types, the claim that ""another type of coronavirus has emerged"" is plausible and consistent with scientific understanding.

1. **Historical Context**: In 2009, many countries, including Serbia, experienced economic downturns due to the global financial crisis. This likely affected Serbia's exports.

2. **Export Data**: We need to examine Serbia's export data from 2009 and compare it to the most recent year to see if there has been significant growth that could compensate for the losses experienced in 2009.

3. **Economic Reports**: Reviewing economic reports and analyses from credible sources such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), or Serbia's national statistical office would provide insights into the country's export performance over the years.

Without specific data and reports at hand, we can make a reasoned assessment based on general trends and available information up to 2023.

Given that many countries have seen economic recovery and growth in exports post-2009, it is plausible that Serbia could have experienced similar trends. However, without concrete data, we cannot definitively confirm the extent of the compensation.

„Kreditni rejting je snižen zahvaljujući lošem radu u javnim finansijama prethodne Vlade.“,half true,sr,"""The credit rating has been downgraded due to the poor management of public finances by the previous government.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Credit Rating Downgrade**: A credit rating downgrade typically occurs when a credit rating agency assesses that the risk of a country defaulting on its debt has increased. This can be due to various factors, including economic performance, political stability, and fiscal management.

2. **Poor Management of Public Finances**: Poor management of public finances can include excessive borrowing, high levels of debt, budget deficits, and inefficient use of public funds. These factors can contribute to a credit rating downgrade.

3. **Previous Government's Role**: The claim specifically attributes the downgrade to the actions of the previous government. This implies that the current financial issues are a result of decisions made by the previous administration.

To evaluate the claim, we would need specific information about the credit rating downgrade, the reasons provided by the credit rating agency, and the financial policies of the previous government. If the credit rating agency explicitly cited poor management of public finances by the previous government as a reason for the downgrade, the claim would be more accurate.

Without specific details, we can make a reasoned judgment based on general knowledge:

- Credit rating agencies often cite poor fiscal management as a reason for downgrades.
- It is common for new governments to attribute financial issues to their predecessors.

Given these points, the claim seems plausible but lacks specific evidence to be fully verified.

1. The share of food expenses in Kazakhstan accounts for almost half of the budget for nearly 50% of citizens.
2. This situation is worse than in neighboring Russia.
3. In developed countries, food expenses make up only 10-12%.

### Verification:

1. **Food Expenses in Kazakhstan:**
   - According to various reports and data from sources like the World Bank and national statistics, a significant portion of the population in Kazakhstan does spend a large share of their income on food. Some estimates suggest that for lower-income households, food expenses can indeed account for a substantial part of their budget, sometimes approaching 50%.

2. **Comparison with Russia:**
   - In Russia, the share of food expenses is generally lower than in Kazakhstan but still higher than in many developed countries. Data from Rosstat (Russian Federal State Statistics Service) indicates that the average Russian household spends around 30-35% of their budget on food.

3. **Developed Countries:**
   - In developed countries, the share of household budgets spent on food is indeed much lower. For example, in the United States and many European countries, food expenses typically account for about 10-12% of household budgets, according to data from the OECD and other economic research organizations.

2. **Stanisław Tyszka's Association with Jarosław Gowin and Poland Together**:
   - Adam Szłapka's statement implies that Tyszka was a close advisor to Jarosław Gowin and a member of the board of the Poland Together party.
   - Stanisław Tyszka has not been prominently known as a close advisor to Jarosław Gowin or as a member of the board of Poland Together. His political career is more closely associated with Kukiz'15 and later with his independent activities.

Given these points, the claim that Stanisław Tyszka is a close advisor to Jarosław Gowin and a member of the board of Poland Together seems inaccurate. However, his radicalism and anti-PiS stance have some basis in his political actions and statements.

Феминитивы необходимы языку и обществу,true,ru,Feminine forms of nouns are necessary for language and society.,"The claim that ""Feminine forms of nouns are necessary for language and society"" can be evaluated from multiple perspectives, including linguistic, cultural, and social viewpoints.

1. **Linguistic Perspective**: In many languages, such as Spanish, French, and German, gendered nouns are a fundamental part of the grammatical structure. These languages have masculine and feminine forms for many nouns, and using the correct form is necessary for proper grammar and communication. In this context, the claim is true because the language's structure requires gendered nouns.

2. **Cultural and Social Perspective**: The necessity of feminine forms of nouns can also be seen in terms of representation and inclusivity. Using feminine forms can promote gender equality and visibility of women in various roles and professions. This can be important for societal progress and the promotion of gender equity. However, the necessity can vary depending on cultural norms and the specific language in question.

3. **English Language**: In English, the use of gendered nouns is less prevalent. While there are some gender-specific terms (e.g., actor/actress), the trend is moving towards gender-neutral language (e.g., using ""actor"" for both men and women). In this context, the necessity of feminine forms is less pronounced.

Considering these perspectives, the claim is not universally true but holds significant importance in certain languages and cultural contexts.

Wawel Castle is a historic site in Poland and has hosted various significant events. George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States, did indeed give a speech at Wawel Castle during his visit to Poland in 2001. However, other prominent figures have also spoken at Wawel Castle. For instance, Pope John Paul II, who was a native of Poland, visited Wawel Castle and gave speeches there.

Given this information, the claim that ""Only G. Bush spoke at Wawel"" is not accurate.

1. **Verification of the Claim**:
   - The speaker claims they never promised Serbia would definitely be part of the EU by 2020.
   - The speaker claims they stated Serbia would fulfill its obligations by 2019, and the decision would then be up to EU countries.

2. **Context and Statements**:
   - If the speaker has a record of public statements or official documents where they explicitly avoided promising definite EU membership by 2020 and instead focused on Serbia fulfilling its obligations by 2019, this would support the claim.
   - If there are no records or if there are contradictory statements where the speaker did promise definite EU membership by 2020, this would undermine the claim.

3. **Assessment**:
   - Without specific evidence to the contrary, if the speaker's public statements align with the claim that they never promised definite EU membership by 2020 and focused on Serbia's obligations, the claim would be considered accurate.

1. **Demographic Trends**: Serbia, like many other countries in Europe, is experiencing an aging population. The birth rate is low, and life expectancy is increasing, leading to a higher proportion of retirees.

2. **Labor Market Data**: The creation of new jobs depends on various factors, including economic growth, investment in industries, and government policies. If the economy is not growing rapidly or if there are structural issues in the labor market, the number of new jobs may not keep pace with the increasing number of retirees.

3. **Economic Forecasts**: Projections from institutions like the World Bank, IMF, or national statistical offices can provide insights into future trends in employment and retirement.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is likely accurate based on current demographic and economic trends.

"„Najveći priliv investicija u Srbiji bio je dok je DSS predvodio Vladu, a građani su to mogli i te kako dobro da osete, jer je prosečna plata tada za sto evra bila veća nego što je danas.“",half true,sr,"""The largest influx of investments in Serbia occurred while the DSS was leading the government, and citizens could definitely feel this, as the average salary was one hundred euros higher than it is today.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. **The largest influx of investments in Serbia occurred while the DSS (Democratic Party of Serbia) was leading the government.**
2. **The average salary was one hundred euros higher during that period compared to today.**

### Point 1: Largest Influx of Investments
- The DSS led the Serbian government primarily during the early 2000s, with Vojislav Koštunica serving as Prime Minister from 2004 to 2008.
- To verify the claim about the largest influx of investments, we would need to compare foreign direct investment (FDI) and other investment data from that period with subsequent periods.
- Available data indicates that Serbia did experience significant FDI during the mid-2000s, but it is essential to compare this with investment data from other periods, especially recent years, to confirm if it was indeed the largest.

### Point 2: Average Salary Comparison
- The average salary in Serbia during the DSS government period (2004-2008) needs to be compared with the current average salary.
- Historical data shows that the average salary in Serbia has generally been increasing over the years, though it has fluctuated due to economic conditions.
- To verify the claim, we need specific figures from the DSS period and current figures. For instance, if the average salary was around 300 euros during the DSS period and is around 400 euros today, the claim would be false.

### Conclusion
Without specific and detailed data, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general trends and available information:

- The claim about the largest influx of investments is debatable and requires precise data comparison.
- The claim about the average salary being one hundred euros higher during the DSS period is likely inaccurate, as average salaries have generally increased over time.

The claim states:
- Previously: 51.1% from the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, 48.9% from the budget.
- Now: 62.2% from the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund, 37.8% from the budget.

If these percentages are accurate and verifiable through reliable sources, then the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the percentages are significantly off, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Without access to the specific data to verify these percentages, I cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the structure and specificity of the claim, it appears to be a detailed statement that would typically be based on verifiable data.

„Intervencije NBS na deviznom tržištu su vrlo skromne u odnosu na protekle godine.“,true,sr,"""The interventions of the National Bank of Serbia in the foreign exchange market are very modest compared to previous years.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The interventions of the National Bank of Serbia in the foreign exchange market are very modest compared to previous years,"" we would need to analyze data on the National Bank of Serbia's foreign exchange market interventions over a span of several years. This would include the volume and frequency of interventions, as well as any official statements or reports from the National Bank of Serbia.

Given that I do not have access to real-time data or specific historical records of the National Bank of Serbia's interventions, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent trends and reports, it could be evaluated as follows:

- If recent reports and data indicate a significant reduction in the volume and frequency of interventions compared to previous years, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the reduction is moderate or not well-documented, the claim might be 'Half True'.
- If there is little to no reduction, or if interventions have actually increased, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on some level of observed trend, I would lean towards a cautious evaluation.

„Plate zdravstvenih radnika su u rangu pomoćnih radnika u javnim preduzećima.“,true,sr,"""The salaries of healthcare workers are on par with those of auxiliary workers in public enterprises.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The salaries of healthcare workers are on par with those of auxiliary workers in public enterprises,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of Healthcare Workers**: Healthcare workers include a wide range of professionals such as doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and support staff. Their salaries can vary significantly based on their roles, qualifications, and experience.

2. **Definition of Auxiliary Workers in Public Enterprises**: Auxiliary workers in public enterprises typically include support staff such as administrative assistants, maintenance workers, and other non-specialized roles. Their salaries also vary but are generally lower than those of specialized professionals.

3. **Salary Comparisons**: Generally, healthcare professionals, especially those with specialized skills and higher education (e.g., doctors, registered nurses), tend to earn higher salaries compared to auxiliary workers in public enterprises. However, some lower-tier healthcare support roles (e.g., medical assistants, orderlies) might have salaries closer to those of auxiliary workers.

4. **Geographical and Sector Variations**: Salaries can vary widely depending on the country, region, and specific public enterprise. For example, in some countries, public sector wages might be more standardized, while in others, there could be significant disparities.

Given these considerations, the claim that ""The salaries of healthcare workers are on par with those of auxiliary workers in public enterprises"" is generally not accurate for the majority of healthcare professionals, though it might hold true for some lower-tier healthcare support roles.

1. **Poland's Tree**: Poland does not have a specific tree dedicated to the entire country at Yad Vashem. However, many individual Poles have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations, and trees have been planted in their honor.

2. **Denmark's Tree**: Denmark is indeed honored with a tree at Yad Vashem. This is in recognition of the collective efforts of the Danish people and the Danish resistance movement to save their Jewish population during the Holocaust.

Without access to specific data or records, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on a reliable source or official record, we can make an educated guess.

1. The statement mentions a six-year gap, which would place the current year at 2012 (2006 + 6 years = 2012).
2. It claims that the budget was adopted in October 2012, and the last time it was adopted in October was in 2006.

To verify this, we would need historical data on budget adoption dates for the years between 2006 and 2012. If the budget was indeed adopted in October 2006 and then not again in October until 2012, the claim would be accurate.

Polski rząd jako pierwszy w Europie zamknął granice,false,pl,The Polish government was the first in Europe to close its borders.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Polish government was the first in Europe to close its borders,"" we need to consider the context and timing of border closures in Europe, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, several European countries began implementing border closures and travel restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Poland was indeed one of the early adopters of such measures. On March 13, 2020, the Polish government announced that it would close its borders to foreigners starting from March 15, 2020.

However, other countries also took similar actions around the same time. For example, the Czech Republic declared a state of emergency and closed its borders to travelers from high-risk countries on March 12, 2020, a day before Poland's announcement. Additionally, Denmark announced border closures on March 13, 2020, effective from March 14, 2020.

Given this information, while Poland was among the first countries in Europe to close its borders, it was not the very first. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

The claim states that the European Commission has written a positive report on Serbia, including reform ideas and a menu for the next year.

1. **Positive Report**: The European Commission's reports on candidate countries like Serbia typically assess progress in various areas such as rule of law, economic reforms, and alignment with EU standards. A ""positive report"" would indicate that Serbia has made significant progress in these areas.

2. **Reform Ideas**: The European Commission often provides recommendations and areas for improvement in its reports. These can be considered ""reform ideas.""

3. **Menu for the Next Year**: This likely refers to a set of priorities or actions that Serbia should focus on in the coming year, which is a common feature in such reports.

To verify this, we would need to look at the latest European Commission report on Serbia. If the report indeed highlights positive progress, includes reform recommendations, and outlines priorities for the next year, the claim would be accurate.

Based on the typical structure and content of European Commission reports on candidate countries, it is reasonable to infer that the claim is likely accurate, assuming no significant deviations in the latest report.

Polacy płacą za gaz więcej niż ktokolwiek w tej części świata.,false,pl,Poles pay more for gas than anyone else in this part of the world.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Poles pay more for gas than anyone else in this part of the world,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Geographical Context**: ""This part of the world"" likely refers to Central and Eastern Europe, but the exact region needs to be clarified.
2. **Gas Prices**: We need to compare the gas prices in Poland with those in neighboring countries such as Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, and others in the region.
3. **Data Source**: Reliable and recent data from sources like Eurostat, the International Energy Agency (IEA), or national statistics offices would be necessary to make an accurate comparison.

Without specific and up-to-date data, it's challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, based on historical data and trends, Poland has had relatively high gas prices compared to some of its neighbors, but not necessarily the highest in all cases.

Given the need for precise and current data to make a definitive judgment, and considering the variability in gas prices over time and across different countries in the region, the claim can be evaluated as follows:

The claim states that the Family 500 plus program results in an increase of about 20 to almost 30 thousand children annually, which is described as ""not even a ten percent increase.""

1. **Understanding the Numbers**: 
   - The increase is specified as 20,000 to 30,000 children annually.
   - The percentage increase is described as ""not even a ten percent increase.""

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - To verify the percentage, we need to know the baseline number of children before the increase. 
   - If the baseline number of children is significantly higher than 300,000, then an increase of 20,000 to 30,000 would indeed be less than 10%.

3. **Mathematical Verification**:
   - For an increase of 30,000 to be 10%, the baseline would need to be 300,000 children.
   - If the baseline is higher, say 1,000,000 children, then 30,000 would be a 3% increase, and 20,000 would be a 2% increase.

Given that the claim specifies the increase is ""not even a ten percent increase,"" and assuming the baseline number of children is significantly higher than 300,000, the statement appears to be accurate.

Pana partia [Platforma Obywatelska] buduje gazoport od 8 lat.,half true,pl,'Your party [Civic Platform] has been building the gas port for 8 years.',"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the Civic Platform party has been building the gas port for 8 years, we need to consider the timeline of the project and the involvement of the Civic Platform party.

1. **Project Timeline**: The construction of the Świnoujście LNG terminal (often referred to as the gas port) in Poland began in 2008 and was completed in 2015. This gives us a construction period of approximately 7 years.

2. **Political Context**: The Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) was the ruling party in Poland from 2007 to 2015. This means that the party was in power during the entire construction period of the gas port.

Given this information, the claim that the Civic Platform has been building the gas port for 8 years is slightly exaggerated in terms of the exact duration but is largely accurate in terms of the party's involvement throughout the construction period.

"„Dug Srbije je 80 procenata BDP, to znači da je Srbija visoko zadužena zemlja.“",mostly true,sr,"""Serbia's debt is 80 percent of GDP, which means that Serbia is a highly indebted country.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Serbia's debt is 80 percent of GDP, which means that Serbia is a highly indebted country,"" we need to verify two main points:

1. The actual debt-to-GDP ratio of Serbia.
2. The classification of a country as ""highly indebted"" based on its debt-to-GDP ratio.

### 1. Debt-to-GDP Ratio of Serbia
As of the latest available data, Serbia's debt-to-GDP ratio has fluctuated over recent years. For instance, in 2021, Serbia's debt-to-GDP ratio was around 57.9%. However, this figure can change annually based on economic conditions, government borrowing, and GDP growth.

### 2. Classification of ""Highly Indebted""
The classification of a country as ""highly indebted"" is somewhat subjective but generally, a debt-to-GDP ratio above 60% is often considered high by many economists and financial institutions. The Maastricht criteria used by the European Union, for example, set a limit of 60% for member countries.

### Conclusion
Given that the claim states Serbia's debt is 80% of GDP, which is higher than the actual figure of around 57.9% (as of 2021), the claim is not accurate. Additionally, while a debt-to-GDP ratio of 80% would indeed be considered high, the actual ratio is lower.

"Warto zwrócić uwagę, że 70% Polaków popiera te reformy, które chcieliśmy wdrażać.",half true,pl,It is worth noting that 70% of Poles support the reforms we wanted to implement.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""It is worth noting that 70% of Poles support the reforms we wanted to implement,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of the Data**: The claim should be backed by a reliable and recent poll or survey conducted by a reputable organization.
2. **Context of the Reforms**: The specific reforms being referred to should be clearly defined. Public support can vary significantly depending on the nature of the reforms.
3. **Sample Size and Demographics**: The poll should have a representative sample of the Polish population to ensure the results are generalizable.
4. **Timing**: Public opinion can change over time, so the timing of the poll is crucial.

Without specific details on these factors, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a recent and reputable poll with a representative sample, it could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific information provided in the claim, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Palikot), e-wybory at 7.5 percent,"" we would need to verify the specific polling data from GFK Polonia and e-wybory regarding J. Palikot's support percentages.

1. **GFK Polonia**: If GFK Polonia indeed published a poll showing J. Palikot's support at 6.5 percent, this part of the claim would be accurate.
2. **e-wybory**: If e-wybory published a poll showing J. Palikot's support at 7.5 percent, this part of the claim would also be accurate.

Without access to the specific polling data from these sources, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data from these sources, it would be considered 'True'.

This involves checking the export and import values reported by reliable sources such as government trade databases, international trade organizations, or reputable economic research institutions.

Given the nature of this task, I would typically consult sources like the United Nations Comtrade database, the World Bank, or official trade statistics from the respective countries' government agencies. However, since I cannot access real-time data, I will provide a general approach to how you can verify this information:

1. **Check Official Trade Databases**: Look up the trade statistics for Serbia and the USA for the year 2010 in databases like UN Comtrade or the World Bank.
2. **Government Reports**: Review trade reports published by the Serbian Statistical Office or the United States Census Bureau.
3. **Economic Research Publications**: Consult reports from economic research institutions that analyze trade data.

Without access to these specific data points at this moment, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if you have access to these resources, you can cross-check the figures provided.

Given the need for precise verification and the absence of real-time data access, I cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, I will refrain from making a final judgment without the necessary data.

Круг реальных рынков сбыта и содержание поставок за время второй индустриально-инновационной пятилетки не изменились,true,ru,The range of real sales markets and the content of supplies have not changed during the second industrial-innovative five-year plan.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and specific details of the second industrial-innovative five-year plan. Typically, such plans are designed to bring about significant changes in various sectors, including real sales markets and the content of supplies. 

If the second industrial-innovative five-year plan aimed at innovation and industrial development, it is likely that there would have been changes in the range of real sales markets and the content of supplies as a result of new technologies, products, and market strategies being implemented.

Given this context, the claim that ""the range of real sales markets and the content of supplies have not changed"" seems unlikely to be accurate.

1. Whether the issue of posted workers is fundamental from the perspective of Polish interests.
2. Whether eleven national parliaments have given the European Commission a yellow card on this matter.

1. The issue of posted workers is indeed significant for Poland. Poland is one of the largest providers of posted workers in the European Union. The rules governing posted workers can impact Polish workers' rights and the competitiveness of Polish companies in the EU market.

2. The ""yellow card"" procedure allows national parliaments to object to a proposed EU legislative act if they believe it violates the principle of subsidiarity. In May 2016, eleven national parliaments did indeed issue a ""yellow card"" against the European Commission's proposal to revise the Posted Workers Directive, arguing that it infringed on national competencies.

Given that both points in the claim are accurate, the claim is 'True'.

1. ""The permit for the gondola was not issued at any point.""
2. ""Therefore, it could not have been contested.""
3. ""What the court dealt with were preparatory works related to archaeological investigations.""

If the permit for the gondola was indeed never issued, then it logically follows that it could not have been contested. Additionally, if the court's involvement was limited to preparatory works related to archaeological investigations, then the claim would be accurate.

Without specific details or context about the gondola project and the court's involvement, we can only assess the logical consistency of the statement. Assuming the information provided is accurate:

1. If no permit was issued, it could not have been contested.
2. If the court dealt with preparatory works related to archaeological investigations, then the claim about the court's focus is accurate.

The claim states that the positions of Slobodan Ilić, the State Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, regarding the opening of the 'Gorenje' factory in Zaječar will not disrupt the good and stable relations between G17 Plus and the DS in the coalition.

1. **Contextual Understanding**: G17 Plus and the Democratic Party (DS) were part of a coalition government in Serbia. The stability of their relationship would depend on various factors, including political agreements, mutual interests, and responses to specific events like the opening of a factory.

2. **Specific Event**: The opening of the 'Gorenje' factory in Zaječar is a significant economic event. If Slobodan Ilić's positions are supportive and align with the coalition's goals, it is less likely to cause disruption.

3. **Political Dynamics**: Political relationships within coalitions can be complex. Even if there are disagreements, they do not necessarily lead to a breakdown in relations unless they are severe or indicative of deeper issues.

Given the information provided, the claim suggests that the specific positions of Slobodan Ilić on this matter will not disrupt the coalition's stability. Without evidence to the contrary, this statement appears to be a reasonable assessment of the situation.

„Oni (Salford) imaju monopol i tvrdim da drže 60 odsto srpskog tržišta.“,mostly true,sr,"""They (Salford) have a monopoly and I claim that they hold 60 percent of the Serbian market.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Salford has a monopoly and holds 60 percent of the Serbian market,"" we need to evaluate two components: the definition of a monopoly and the market share percentage.

1. **Monopoly Definition**: A monopoly exists when a single company or entity is the sole provider of a particular product or service in a market, with no close substitutes, and has significant control over the market price and supply.

2. **Market Share**: Holding 60 percent of the market share indicates a dominant position but does not necessarily equate to a monopoly, as other competitors still exist and hold the remaining 40 percent of the market.

Given these points:
- If Salford holds 60 percent of the market, it suggests a dominant position but not a complete monopoly, as other competitors are present.
- Therefore, the claim that Salford has a monopoly is not accurate, but the claim that they hold 60 percent of the market is accurate.

Combining these two aspects, the claim is partially correct but not entirely accurate.

Китайский премьер молится в мечети,false,ru,The Chinese premier prays in a mosque.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Chinese premier prays in a mosque,"" we need to consider the context and available evidence.

1. **Religious Practices of Chinese Leaders**: Chinese leaders, including the premier, typically do not publicly engage in religious practices due to the secular nature of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP promotes atheism and often restricts religious activities.

2. **Public Appearances**: While Chinese leaders may visit religious sites, including mosques, for diplomatic or cultural reasons, it is highly unusual for them to participate in religious rituals such as praying.

3. **Verification**: There is no widely reported or verified instance of a Chinese premier praying in a mosque. Visits to mosques may occur, but actual participation in prayer would be inconsistent with the CCP's stance on religion.

Given these points, the claim lacks substantial evidence and contradicts the known practices of Chinese political leaders.

Public debt was around 70 percent of GDP in 2014, now it is 50.6 percent.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific figures mentioned regarding the budget deficit, fiscal surplus, and public debt for the years 2014 and 2018. This involves checking historical economic data from reliable sources such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, or national financial reports.

1. **Budget Deficit in 2014**: The claim states it was around 6.2% of GDP.
2. **Fiscal Surplus in 2018**: The claim states it was 0.6% of GDP and that a surplus was achieved for three consecutive years.
3. **Public Debt in 2014 and 2018**: The claim states it was around 70% of GDP in 2014 and 50.6% in 2018.

### Verification:
- **Budget Deficit in 2014**: According to IMF data, the budget deficit for many countries undergoing IMF programs around 2014 was indeed high, often around the 6% mark.
- **Fiscal Surplus in 2018**: IMF reports and national financial statements can confirm if a fiscal surplus was achieved and maintained for three consecutive years.
- **Public Debt**: IMF and World Bank data can provide the exact figures for public debt as a percentage of GDP for the years in question.

### Analysis:
- If the figures align closely with the data from these sources, the claim can be considered accurate.
- If there are minor discrepancies, the claim might be 'Mostly True'.
- Significant discrepancies would lead to a 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' rating.

Given the nature of the claim and assuming the data aligns closely with IMF and World Bank reports, the claim appears to be well-supported.

1. **Check official records**: Review the official records of the Sejm to see if any bills have been submitted by President Andrzej Duda since June of the previous year.
2. **Consult news sources**: Look for credible news reports or official statements that might confirm or refute the claim.
3. **Review presidential activities**: Examine any public records or announcements from the President's office regarding legislative submissions.

Without access to real-time data and official records, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information, we can proceed with the following:

If the claim is accurate and no bills have been submitted by Andrzej Duda since June of last year, the claim would be 'True'. If there is evidence of at least one bill submission, the claim would be 'False'.

1. **Economic Data**: Recent reports and economic indicators can provide insights into the state of the construction industry. If data shows a gradual increase in construction activity, employment, and investment, it would support the claim.

2. **Industry Reports**: Reports from industry associations, such as the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) or the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), can offer detailed analyses of the industry's recovery.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Statements from economists and industry experts can provide context and validation for the claim.

4. **Historical Context**: Understanding the duration and severity of the crisis that the construction industry faced is crucial. If the industry has been in a downturn for a significant period and is now showing signs of recovery, the claim would be more credible.

Based on these considerations, if recent data and expert analyses indicate that the construction industry is indeed showing signs of recovery after a prolonged downturn, the claim would be 'Mostly True'. However, if the recovery is uneven or not well-supported by data, it might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

1. **Heparin and SARS-CoV-2**: Heparin is a well-known anticoagulant that has been studied for its potential antiviral properties. Some studies have suggested that heparin can bind to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, potentially blocking the virus from entering cells. However, these studies are often preliminary and conducted in vitro (in the lab) rather than in vivo (in living organisms).

2. **Comparison to Remdesivir**: Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that has been authorized for emergency use in treating COVID-19. It works by inhibiting the replication of the virus. Clinical trials have shown that Remdesivir can reduce the recovery time in hospitalized patients, although its effectiveness has been debated.

3. **Scientific Consensus**: As of the latest information, there is no broad scientific consensus that heparin is more effective than Remdesivir in treating COVID-19. While heparin may show promise in laboratory settings, it has not been widely adopted or proven in clinical settings to surpass Remdesivir in effectiveness.

Given the current state of research, the claim that heparin found in algae is capable of blocking SARS-CoV-2 and surpasses Remdesivir in its ability to do so is not fully supported by comprehensive clinical evidence.

1. **Definition of Subsidies**: Subsidies can include direct financial support, tax breaks, grants, and other forms of financial assistance provided by the government to support the mining industry.

2. **Sources of Information**: Reliable sources such as government budget reports, industry analyses, and independent research studies should be consulted to verify the amount allocated to mining subsidies.

3. **Context and Scope**: The claim does not specify whether it refers to a specific country or globally. For the sake of this analysis, we will assume it refers to a single country, such as the United States, unless otherwise specified.

4. **Data Verification**:
   - According to various reports, including those from environmental organizations and government watchdogs, the U.S. government provides significant subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, which includes coal mining. However, the exact amount can vary based on the source and the methodology used to calculate subsidies.
   - Some estimates suggest that the total subsidies for fossil fuels in the U.S. can range from several billion to tens of billions of dollars annually, but this includes oil, gas, and coal combined.

Given the complexity and variability in the data, it is challenging to pinpoint an exact figure of $10 billion specifically for mining subsidies without more precise and up-to-date information.

**Conclusion**: The claim that $10 billion is allocated each year to subsidize mines is likely an overgeneralization or an approximation. While significant subsidies do exist, the exact figure may not be precisely $10 billion annually.

This can vary significantly depending on the country in question. 

In many democratic systems, the government, often led by a Prime Minister or equivalent, plays a significant role in shaping and conducting foreign policy. However, the President (or equivalent head of state) may also have substantial influence, particularly in presidential systems like that of the United States, where the President is both the head of state and the head of government.

In parliamentary systems, the Prime Minister and the cabinet typically have more direct control over foreign policy, although the President or monarch may still have some ceremonial or advisory roles.

Given the general nature of the claim and without specifying a particular country, it is not accurate to say that the government does not conduct foreign policy and only serves as a service activity of the President's office. This oversimplifies and misrepresents the complex interplay of roles in most political systems.

2. **Price Reduction of at Least 12 Percent**: This would need confirmation that the new agreement stipulates a price reduction of at least 12 percent for Russian gas supplied to Serbia.

3. **Possibility of Additional Discount**: This part of the claim suggests that there is a potential for further price reductions at the time of signing, which would need to be supported by statements from the negotiating parties or official documents.

1. **Current Composition of Ministers**: We need the exact number of ministers in the current cabinet.
2. **Number of Government Members in 2000 and Before**: We need historical data on the number of ministers in the year 2000 and prior years.

Without specific numbers, we can only make a general assessment based on available trends and data. Historically, the size of cabinets can vary significantly depending on the country, political context, and administrative needs.

If the current cabinet has fewer ministers compared to the year 2000 and earlier, the claim would be 'True'. If it has slightly fewer ministers, it would be 'Mostly True'. If the numbers are roughly the same, it would be 'Half True'. If the current cabinet has slightly more ministers, it would be 'Mostly False'. If it has significantly more ministers, it would be 'False'.

This involves checking reliable sources such as official health statistics or reputable databases that track COVID-19 data.

1. **Spain**: According to data from sources like Worldometer or Our World in Data, Spain had a significant number of COVID-19 deaths per one million residents. As of the latest updates, the number is indeed in the hundreds, often reported around 600-700 deaths per million.

2. **Poland**: Similarly, checking the same sources for Poland, the number of COVID-19 deaths per one million residents is also available. Poland's death rate per million has been lower than Spain's, but it is still in the range of tens to hundreds. The figure of 65 deaths per million seems plausible for an earlier stage of the pandemic but may not reflect the most current data.

Given that the claim specifies exact numbers, it is crucial to match these with the most recent and accurate data. If the numbers provided in the claim are close to the verified statistics, the claim can be considered accurate.

Based on the latest available data:
- Spain's death rate per million is around 630.
- Poland's death rate per million is higher than 65, typically reported in the hundreds.

Therefore, the claim underestimates the death rate in Poland.

Without access to specific and verifiable data sources, it is challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of this claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible survey or report, it could be considered accurate. Conversely, if there is no reliable data to support this figure, the claim could be misleading.

Dzisiaj mamy coraz więcej samobójstw w szkołach.,half true,pl,Today we have more and more suicides in schools.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Today we have more and more suicides in schools,"" we need to consider recent data and trends regarding youth suicides.

1. **Data Trends**: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide rates among young people have been increasing over the past decade. The CDC reported that from 2007 to 2018, the suicide rate among individuals aged 10-24 increased by 57.4%.

2. **Context**: While the overall trend shows an increase, it's important to note that this data encompasses a broad age range and does not exclusively focus on school settings. However, schools are a significant part of young people's lives, and the increase in youth suicides can be reflected in school environments.

3. **Recent Reports**: Various studies and reports have highlighted the growing concern about mental health issues among students, which can contribute to higher suicide rates. Factors such as academic pressure, social media influence, and mental health stigma are often cited.

Given this information, the claim that there are ""more and more suicides in schools"" aligns with the broader trend of increasing youth suicides, though it may not be exclusively confined to school settings.

According to the latest data, the trade volume between these two countries has indeed been substantial, often exceeding the 2 billion US dollar mark.

Given this context, the claim that the trade volume exceeded 2.7 billion US dollars last year is plausible and aligns with the general trend of increasing trade between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

The claim states that Germany is the largest trading partner and the United Kingdom is the second largest trading partner.

Trade relationships can vary significantly depending on the country being referred to. For example, if the country in question is the United States, China is typically the largest trading partner, followed by Canada and Mexico, not Germany or the United Kingdom. If the country is a member of the European Union, Germany is often a major trading partner, but the ranking of the United Kingdom can vary.

Given the lack of specific context about which country is being referred to, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge, it is unlikely that the United Kingdom is the second largest trading partner for most countries where Germany is the largest.

1. **Greater Mutual Trust**: This is a subjective statement and can be interpreted in various ways. However, if there has been an improvement in diplomatic and economic relations between Serbia and the USA, this could be considered true.

2. **Growth of National Airline and Airport**: If Serbia's national airline (Air Serbia) and its main airport (Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport) have shown significant growth in terms of passenger numbers, destinations, and infrastructure, this part of the claim would be true.

3. **Security Conditions**: If Serbia has improved its security measures to meet international standards, particularly those required by the USA for direct flights, this part of the claim would be true.

4. **Not Everyone Can Fly to the USA**: This is true as the USA has strict regulations and security requirements for airlines and airports that wish to operate direct flights to the country.

5. **Couldn't for 25 Years**: If Serbia did not have direct flights to the USA for 25 years and has recently resumed them, this part of the claim would be true.

Given these points, the claim appears to be largely accurate but contains subjective elements that are harder to verify definitively.

This involves checking reliable sources such as financial reports, industry analyses, or official statistics from relevant financial authorities.

Given that I don't have access to real-time data or external databases, I can't independently verify these specific figures. However, I can provide a logical approach to assess the claim:

1. **SMEs Microcredit Portfolio Growth**: The claim states an 850% increase. This is an exceptionally high growth rate and would typically be supported by significant economic events or policy changes.

2. **SMEs Overdue Debt Growth**: The claim states a 238% increase. This is also a substantial increase and would likely correlate with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected many businesses.

3. **Individuals Microcredit Growth**: The claim states a 145% increase. This is a high growth rate but more plausible given the economic conditions and increased borrowing during the pandemic.

4. **Individuals Overdue Debt Growth**: The claim states a 332% increase. This is a very high increase and would suggest significant financial distress among individuals.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively confirm or refute these figures. However, the claim seems to be plausible given the context of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased borrowing and financial distress.

It is true that the environmental tax is only a few percent relative to the price.""","To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into two parts:

1. ""It is not true that many devices will become twenty percent more expensive due to environmental taxes.""
2. ""It is true that the environmental tax is only a few percent relative to the price.""

For the first part, the claim states that it is not true that many devices will become twenty percent more expensive due to environmental taxes. This implies that the increase in price due to environmental taxes is significantly less than twenty percent.

For the second part, the claim states that the environmental tax is only a few percent relative to the price. This suggests that the environmental tax is indeed a small fraction of the total price, likely less than twenty percent.

If both parts are accurate, the overall claim would be consistent and correct. Given that the environmental tax is described as only a few percent, it supports the assertion that devices will not become twenty percent more expensive due to these taxes.

"...согласно данным научной статистики, в целом каждый наркоман втягивает в среднем от 5 до 17 человек в потребление наркотиков...",half true,ru,"According to scientific statistics, on average, each drug addict involves between 5 to 17 people in drug use.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""on average, each drug addict involves between 5 to 17 people in drug use,"" we need to examine the available scientific literature and statistics on the social spread of drug addiction.

1. **Scientific Literature**: There is limited specific data quantifying the exact number of people a single drug addict might influence to start using drugs. While it is well-documented that drug use can spread through social networks, the precise number of people influenced can vary widely based on numerous factors such as the type of drug, social environment, and individual behavior.

2. **Influence of Social Networks**: Studies have shown that drug use can spread through social networks, and individuals are more likely to use drugs if they have friends or family members who do. However, the range of 5 to 17 people seems to be an arbitrary figure not commonly cited in scientific research.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Experts in the field of addiction and public health often emphasize the role of social influence but do not typically provide a specific average number of people influenced by a single addict.

Given the lack of specific, widely-accepted scientific evidence to support the exact range of 5 to 17 people, the claim appears to be more speculative than factual.

1. **Poland**: Schools in Poland were closed on March 12, 2020. According to available data, Poland had around 31 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on that date.

2. **France**: Schools in France were closed on March 16, 2020. On that date, France had approximately 5,423 confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Given this information, the claim that schools in Poland were closed when there were around 30 confirmed cases is accurate. However, the claim that schools in France were closed when there were 2000 confirmed cases is not accurate, as the actual number was significantly higher.

„Kada god dođe može samo da se uveri da mi sve radimo kako bi došli do krajnjeg cilja.“,mostly true,sr,"""Whenever he comes, he can only see that we are doing everything to reach the final goal.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the statement: ""Whenever he comes, he can only see that we are doing everything to reach the final goal.""

1. **""Whenever he comes""** implies that every time this person visits or checks in, a specific observation is made.
2. **""he can only see""** suggests that the person's observation is limited to a particular view or perception.
3. **""that we are doing everything to reach the final goal""** indicates that the observed actions are entirely focused on achieving a specific objective.

For the claim to be 'True', it must be accurate that every time this person visits, they exclusively observe efforts directed towards the final goal, with no other activities or distractions visible.

Given the absolute nature of the terms ""whenever"" and ""only,"" the claim leaves no room for exceptions. If there is any instance where the person observes something other than efforts towards the final goal, the claim would not be entirely true.

Without specific evidence to confirm that this is always the case, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be 'Mostly True' if the majority of observations align with the claim, but not necessarily every single one.

Grande parte da mídia achava que ele [Cesare Battisti] era um pobre coitado,half true,sr,A large part of the media thought that he [Cesare Battisti] was a poor wretch.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""a large part of the media thought that he [Cesare Battisti] was a poor wretch,"" we need to consider the general media portrayal of Cesare Battisti over time.

Cesare Battisti is an Italian former member of the Armed Proletarians for Communism, a far-left militant group. He was convicted in absentia for involvement in four murders in the late 1970s. Battisti fled Italy and lived in various countries, including France and Brazil, where he received support from some intellectuals and political figures who viewed him as a victim of political persecution rather than a common criminal.

The media portrayal of Battisti has been mixed. Some media outlets and commentators, particularly in France and Brazil, have indeed portrayed him sympathetically, emphasizing his claims of innocence and framing him as a victim of a flawed judicial process. This sympathetic portrayal aligns with the idea of him being seen as a ""poor wretch.""

However, other media outlets, especially in Italy, have consistently portrayed him as a convicted terrorist and murderer who evaded justice for decades. This portrayal is far from seeing him as a ""poor wretch.""

Given this mixed media portrayal, it would be inaccurate to say that a ""large part"" of the media uniformly viewed him as a poor wretch. The media's view on Battisti has been divided, with significant portions portraying him in a negative light.

1. **The Journal of Immunology's Citation Status**: According to the 2019 Journal Citation Reports, The Journal of Immunology is indeed one of the most cited journals in the field of immunology. This part of the claim is accurate.

2. **Publication of the Article**: We need to verify if The Journal of Immunology published an article titled ""Understanding the Mechanism of Action of Highly Diluted Biological Preparations"" and if it specifically discusses the domestic drug ""Ergoferon.""

To verify the second point, we would need access to the archives or database of The Journal of Immunology to check for the specific article mentioned. Without direct access to these resources, we can look for secondary sources or databases that index scientific publications.

Given the specificity of the claim, it is unlikely that such a detailed and specific article title would be fabricated without some basis. However, without direct verification, we cannot be entirely certain.

1. **Article 16, Paragraph 2**: We need to confirm if such an article exists and if it indeed states that the opinion of all Council members is necessary for dismissal.
2. **Context of REM**: Understanding the specific rules and regulations governing the dismissal of REM members is crucial.

Without access to the specific legal text or additional context, we can only evaluate the logical consistency and general plausibility of the claim based on typical governance structures.

- **Governance Structures**: In many organizations, the dismissal of members often requires a formal process, which may include obtaining opinions or votes from other members. This is to ensure fairness and due process.
- **Self-Criticism**: The claim that members would not criticize themselves is a reasonable assumption based on human behavior and organizational dynamics.

2. **Mostly True**: This would mean the statement is largely accurate but may have some minor exceptions or additional context that slightly alters its meaning.
3. **Half True**: This would mean the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or context that significantly affect its interpretation.
4. **Mostly False**: This would mean the statement has some element of truth but is largely misleading or incorrect.

Given the statement, it implies a binary situation where either the coalition is necessary for forming a government, or the democrats and progressives must form a majority. This could be true in a specific political context where the coalition holds a balance of power, but without additional context, it's challenging to assess the exact accuracy.

1. **Historical Context**: Livestock production in the early 20th century was significantly different from modern practices. Advances in technology, veterinary medicine, and agricultural practices have generally led to increased productivity over time.

2. **Data Trends**: According to data from sources like the USDA and FAO, livestock production in many parts of the world, including the United States, has generally increased over the 20th and early 21st centuries. There have been fluctuations due to economic, environmental, and policy factors, but the overall trend has been upward.

3. **Specifics of the Claim**:
   - The claim states a ""dramatic decline in livestock production every year"" from 1910 to 2013.
   - It also states that the level of production in 2013 is ""below that of 1910.""

Given the historical data and trends, the claim that there has been a consistent annual decline in livestock production from 1910 to 2013, resulting in levels below those of 1910, is not supported by the evidence. In fact, livestock production has generally increased over this period.

„Neće biti izbornog duela između Tadića i Đilasa.“,true,sr,"""There will be no election debate between Tadić and Đilas.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There will be no election debate between Tadić and Đilas,"" we need to verify whether any official sources or credible news reports confirm or deny the occurrence of such a debate.

1. **Research**: Check recent news articles, official statements from the political parties or candidates involved, and any announcements from election organizers.
2. **Context**: Understand the political context and whether there have been any scheduled debates or public statements about the candidates' willingness to participate in a debate.

Without specific information or context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that there is no evidence of a scheduled debate or if both candidates have publicly stated they will not debate, the claim would be 'True'. Conversely, if there is evidence of a scheduled debate or ongoing negotiations, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information provided in the question, I will assume that the claim is based on a verified source stating that no debate will occur.

2. ""Four million eight hundred thousand citizens did not receive shares.""

Without additional context or evidence to verify these specific numbers and the circumstances under which shares were supposed to be distributed, it is challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, the specificity of the numbers suggests that there might be some basis for the claim, but without concrete evidence, it is difficult to fully validate it.

Given the lack of verifiable information, the claim cannot be fully confirmed or denied. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be 'Half True' as it acknowledges the possibility of some truth but also the lack of complete verification.

1. ""It is interesting that our salaries have equaled those of May last year.""
   - This statement suggests that the current salaries are the same as they were in May of the previous year.

2. ""The difference is two hundred dinars.""
   - This seems contradictory to the first statement. If the salaries have equaled those of May last year, there should be no difference. However, if this means the difference from another point in time, it needs clarification.

3. ""Despite the fact that salaries in the public sector are lower, salaries in the private sector have reached a significantly higher level and we have equaled last year.""
   - This statement implies that private sector salaries have increased significantly, but overall salaries (including public sector) have only equaled last year's levels.

4. ""These are data that indicate we have achieved a great result.""
   - This is a subjective interpretation of the data.

Given the information provided, there are inconsistencies and ambiguities in the statements. The claim that salaries have equaled those of May last year contradicts the mention of a 200 dinar difference. Additionally, the statement about private sector salaries increasing significantly while overall salaries have only equaled last year's levels needs more context and data for verification.

1. **Telekom's Program Lineup**: If Telekom indeed includes the N1 channel in its program offerings, then the first part of the claim is true.
2. **Access for All Telekom Users**: If all users who subscribe to Telekom's services can access the N1 channel without any restrictions, then the second part of the claim is also true.

1. **NATO's Contingency Plans**: In 2010, NATO did indeed update its contingency plans for the defense of its member states, including Poland and the Baltic states. This was part of a broader effort to reassure Eastern European members in the wake of increased tensions with Russia, particularly after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.

2. **Role of President Obama**: As the President of the United States, Barack Obama played a significant role in NATO's decision-making processes, but NATO decisions are made collectively by all member states, not unilaterally by the U.S. President.

3. **Details of the Plans**: The claim states that the plans were ""very precisely described,"" which is a subjective assessment. While the plans were indeed detailed, the exact level of precision is not publicly disclosed due to the classified nature of military contingency plans.

Given this context, the claim is largely accurate but slightly overstated in attributing the decision solely to President Obama and in the subjective assessment of the plan's precision.

1. **Vojvodina being the richest part of Serbia**: Vojvodina is one of the most economically developed regions in Serbia, with a significant contribution to the country's GDP, especially through agriculture and industry. However, whether it is the ""richest"" part can be subjective and may depend on various economic indicators.

2. **The largest number of social assistance beneficiaries living in Vojvodina**: This would require specific data on social assistance distribution across different regions of Serbia. If Vojvodina indeed has the highest number of social assistance beneficiaries, it would support the claim.

Without specific data to confirm or refute these points, we can only make an educated guess based on general knowledge. Given that Vojvodina is economically significant but also has areas with economic challenges, the claim might have some basis but could be an oversimplification.

The statement suggests that by providing answers to a questionnaire that has not yet been received, the time needed to respond to the questionnaire will be shortened by several months.

1. **Premise 1**: ""I will also hand over to Mr. Fule the answers to the questionnaire that they have not yet sent to us.""
   - This implies that answers are being prepared and handed over before the official receipt of the questionnaire.

2. **Premise 2**: ""Simply put, in this way, we will shorten by several months the time needed to respond to the questionnaire from the moment we officially receive it.""
   - This suggests that preemptively preparing and submitting answers will expedite the overall process.

Given these premises, the claim hinges on the assumption that preemptive preparation and submission of answers will indeed shorten the response time. This is a reasonable assumption if the answers are accurate and align with the questions that will be asked. However, without knowing the exact content of the questionnaire, there is a risk that some answers may not be fully applicable or may need revision, which could affect the time saved.

Therefore, while the claim is plausible and likely to be true under the assumption that the pre-prepared answers are accurate and relevant, there is some uncertainty involved.

1. **Serbia's General Government Deficit**: According to recent data, Serbia's general government deficit has been around 3-4% of GDP in recent years.

2. **France's General Government Deficit**: France has had a higher deficit, often exceeding 7-8% of GDP, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

3. **Germany's General Government Deficit**: Germany has managed its deficit well, often keeping it below 3% of GDP, and sometimes even achieving a surplus.

Given this data:
- The claim that Serbia's deficit is drastically below that of most significant EU countries is generally accurate.
- The specific comparison to France, stating that France's deficit is two and a half times larger than Serbia's, is also accurate based on recent figures.
- The statement about Germany operating exceptionally well and not being comparable to Serbia is also accurate.

2. **Current Data and Trends**: If there is current data or trends that strongly support the likelihood of this prediction, it could be considered more credible. However, without specific data or context, it's challenging to assess the accuracy.

3. **Regional Comparison**: The claim involves a comparison with other regions. Without knowing the economic forecasts for all regions involved, it's difficult to definitively judge the claim.

I know what I'm saying, by 9 zlotys, sir.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Family benefits were increased by 9 zlotys over 8 years of the Platform's rule,"" we need to examine the historical data on family benefits during the time when the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) was in power in Poland.

The Civic Platform was in power from 2007 to 2015. During this period, family benefits, including child benefits, were subject to various adjustments. However, the specific claim that the increase was only 9 zlotys over the entire 8-year period needs to be verified against official records and data.

If we look at the data:
- In 2007, the family benefit for the first child was 48 zlotys.
- By 2015, the family benefit for the first child had increased to 77 zlotys.

This indicates an increase of 29 zlotys over the 8-year period, not 9 zlotys.

Given this information, the claim that family benefits were increased by only 9 zlotys over 8 years is not accurate.

1. The budget of the Film Center of Serbia six years ago.
2. The current budget of the Film Center of Serbia.
3. Whether the current budget is indeed 50 times larger than it was six years ago.

If the current budget is exactly 50 times larger than it was six years ago, the claim would be 'True'. If it is close to 50 times but not exactly, it might be 'Mostly True'. If it is significantly less than 50 times but still a substantial increase, it could be 'Half True'. If the increase is minimal or not close to 50 times, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

The number of geriatricians can vary significantly by country and over time. 

For example, in the United States, the American Geriatrics Society reported that there were approximately 7,300 certified geriatricians as of recent years. This number is far higher than 436. However, if the claim pertains to a smaller country or a specific region, the number could be different.

1. **Source of the Claim**: The credibility of the source making the claim is important. If the claim comes from a reliable government report or a reputable financial institution, it is more likely to be accurate.

2. **Details of the Reform**: Understanding the specific reforms being implemented and how they are projected to save money is crucial. This includes changes in retirement age, pension calculation methods, or other structural adjustments.

3. **Economic Context**: The broader economic context, including inflation rates, economic growth, and other fiscal policies, can impact the actual savings achieved.

4. **Verification**: Cross-referencing with independent analyses or reports from financial experts or institutions can help verify the claim.

Without specific data or sources to verify the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible source and reasonable economic projections, we might lean towards a positive assessment.

2. In Poland, there has been a twentyfold increase in beer consumption and a decrease in hop production.

### Germany:
- Germany is one of the largest beer consumers and producers in the world.
- Historically, increased beer consumption in Germany has indeed driven hop production, as hops are a key ingredient in beer.

### Poland:
- Poland has seen a significant increase in beer consumption over the past few decades.
- However, the claim of a ""twentyfold increase"" in beer consumption seems exaggerated. While there has been growth, it is not likely to be twentyfold.
- Hop production in Poland has decreased over the years, despite the increase in beer consumption. This could be due to various factors such as changes in agricultural practices, economic factors, or importation of hops from other countries.

Given the information, the claim about Germany is accurate, but the specifics about Poland's beer consumption increase seem exaggerated, although the trend of decreased hop production is correct.

- For Belgium: Is it true that the support is €60 per day per person?

If both parts of the claim are accurate, then the claim would be 'True'. If one part is accurate and the other is not, it would be 'Half True'. If both parts are inaccurate, it would be 'False'.

Without specific data to verify these figures, we can only assess the claim based on general knowledge and available information. Generally, financial support for asylum seekers or refugees can vary widely between countries and contexts.

1. **Children under 12 years old must not be left alone without supervision**: This is generally true in many jurisdictions, including Kazakhstan, where child protection laws often stipulate that young children should not be left unsupervised.

2. **A child cannot return from school and go to buy bread by themselves**: This is an interpretation of the supervision requirement. While the law may not explicitly state this scenario, it falls under the general principle of not leaving young children unsupervised.

3. **Parents must prevent the viewing, reading, and distribution of materials containing pornography, violence, extremism, and terrorism**: This is a common legal requirement in many countries, including Kazakhstan, to protect children from harmful content.

4. **Pornography shown on ZOOM during lessons**: This is a specific incident and not a general legal requirement. It highlights a challenge but does not negate the legal responsibility of parents.

5. **State does not block internet resources in Kazakhstan, but parents somehow have to block them**: This is a critique of the practical challenges parents face. While the state may not block all harmful content, parents are still legally responsible for monitoring their children's internet use.

6. **Ensure that their children comply with the requirements established by the internal regulations and the Charter of the educational organization**: This is a standard expectation in many educational systems, including Kazakhstan.

7. **If we are sometimes late for school, can we prepare the child for an orphanage?**: This is an exaggeration. Being late for school occasionally is unlikely to result in losing parental rights, but chronic neglect or failure to meet educational requirements could have more serious consequences.

8. **Fulfill other duties provided by the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan**: This is a general statement that is true for all legal obligations.

Given the analysis, the claim mixes accurate legal requirements with some exaggerations and specific incidents that do not necessarily reflect the general legal framework.

Let's break down the claim:

1. **Prime Minister of Serbia**: Verify if the individual making the claim is indeed the current Prime Minister of Serbia.
2. **Highest number of votes**: Check historical election data to see if this Prime Minister received the highest number of votes in any election in modern Serbian history.
3. **Not the highest number of mandates**: Confirm if the number of parliamentary seats won by this Prime Minister's party is not the highest compared to other elections.

Without specific names and dates, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is made by a recent Prime Minister, we can look at the election results for context.

For example, Ana Brnabić has been the Prime Minister of Serbia since 2017. In the 2020 parliamentary elections, the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), led by President Aleksandar Vučić, won a significant majority. However, the claim about the highest number of votes would need to be cross-checked with historical election data.

Given the complexity and the need for precise historical data, the claim could be evaluated as follows:

- If the Prime Minister received a record number of votes but not the highest number of mandates, the claim could be 'Mostly True'.
- If there is any discrepancy in the data or if the claim is exaggerated, it could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

"„U mojoj biografiji nikada nije bilo incidenata, nikada krivično nisam gonjen, a ispadoh najveći siledžija.“",mostly false,sr,"""In my biography, there have never been any incidents, I have never been criminally prosecuted, yet I turned out to be the biggest bully.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components:

1. ""In my biography, there have never been any incidents"" - This part of the claim suggests that the person has no recorded incidents in their life that could be considered problematic or noteworthy in a negative sense.

2. ""I have never been criminally prosecuted"" - This part asserts that the person has never faced criminal charges or been taken to court for a crime.

3. ""I turned out to be the biggest bully"" - This part is more subjective and depends on the context and perspective. Being labeled as the ""biggest bully"" could be based on personal experiences, opinions of others, or specific actions that are not necessarily criminal but are perceived as bullying.

Without specific information about the individual's biography, criminal record, and behavior, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the person is being truthful about their lack of criminal prosecution and incidents, but they are perceived as a bully, the claim could be seen as a mix of factual and subjective elements.

"Видео, снятое в селе Масанчи Кордайского района Жамбылской области Казахстана",true,ru,A video filmed in the village of Masanchi in the Korday district of the Zhambyl region of Kazakhstan.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify if there is credible evidence that a video was indeed filmed in the village of Masanchi in the Korday district of the Zhambyl region of Kazakhstan. 

Given the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2021, there have been notable incidents in Masanchi, such as ethnic clashes in February 2020, which were widely reported and documented. Videos from such events could plausibly be attributed to this location.

However, without specific details about the content or context of the video in question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. 

Based on the general knowledge that videos have been filmed in Masanchi during significant events, the claim is likely accurate but not verifiable with absolute certainty without additional context.

В Казахстане в среднем в год собирают около 300 тысяч тонн хлопка-сырца.,true,ru,"In Kazakhstan, an average of about 300 thousand tons of raw cotton is harvested annually.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Kazakhstan, an average of about 300 thousand tons of raw cotton is harvested annually,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on cotton production in Kazakhstan.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other agricultural production databases, Kazakhstan's cotton production has varied over the years. However, recent figures suggest that the annual production of raw cotton in Kazakhstan is generally lower than 300 thousand tons. For instance, in recent years, the production has been closer to 200-250 thousand tons annually.

Given this information, the claim that Kazakhstan harvests an average of about 300 thousand tons of raw cotton annually appears to be an overestimation.

Четверо украинских военных скончались после введения американской вакцины от коронавируса,false,ru,Four Ukrainian soldiers died after receiving the American coronavirus vaccine.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Four Ukrainian soldiers died after receiving the American coronavirus vaccine,"" we need to evaluate the available evidence and credible sources.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the claim has been reported by reputable news organizations or health authorities. Misinformation often spreads through unreliable sources.
2. **Official Statements**: Look for statements from the Ukrainian government, the U.S. government, or international health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
3. **Vaccine Safety Data**: Review the safety data of the vaccines approved for emergency use, such as those from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, to see if there have been any reported incidents of deaths directly linked to the vaccine.

Upon reviewing the available information:

- There are no credible reports or official statements confirming that four Ukrainian soldiers died as a direct result of receiving an American coronavirus vaccine.
- The vaccines approved for emergency use have undergone rigorous testing and monitoring for safety and efficacy. While there have been rare adverse events, deaths directly attributed to the vaccine are extremely rare and typically involve underlying health conditions.

Given the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim, it is likely to be false.

1. **Decision by the City Assembly**: We need to confirm if the City Assembly indeed made a decision regarding the location of the Pride Parade.
2. **Location - Palace of Serbia**: We need to verify if the Palace of Serbia is the designated location for the Pride Parade.
3. **Central Location**: We need to establish whether the Palace of Serbia is considered a central location in the country and not a marginalized position or an open field.

Assuming we have verified the following:
- The City Assembly did make a decision about the location of the Pride Parade.
- The designated location is indeed the Palace of Serbia.
- The Palace of Serbia is considered a central location in the country.

Given these points, the claim would be accurate.

PO wprowadziła JOW-y w samorządach i w Senacie.,half true,pl,PO introduced single-member districts in local governments and in the Senate.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that 'PO introduced single-member districts in local governments and in the Senate,' we need to examine the historical and legislative actions taken by the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska, PO) party in Poland.

1. **Local Governments**: The Civic Platform (PO) did indeed play a role in introducing single-member districts (SMDs) for local government elections. In 2011, the Polish parliament passed a law that introduced single-member districts for municipal councils in towns with up to 20,000 inhabitants. This change was part of a broader effort to reform local government elections and was supported by PO.

2. **Senate**: The introduction of single-member districts for the Senate was also a significant reform associated with PO. In 2011, the electoral law was changed to establish single-member districts for the election of Senators. This reform was part of the broader electoral changes implemented during the time when PO was in power.

Given this information, the claim that 'PO introduced single-member districts in local governments and in the Senate' is accurate.

More than 100,000 people left the mining industry, which is more than 42% of those employed on the day the program started.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Timeframe of the Program**: The claim states that the mining restructuring program was implemented between 1998-2002, with modifications until 2006.
2. **Number of Mines Closed**: The claim mentions that 13 mines were closed.
3. **Reduction in Extraction**: The claim states that extraction was significantly reduced in another 10 mines.
4. **Employment Impact**: The claim asserts that more than 100,000 people left the mining industry, which is more than 42% of those employed at the start of the program.

Without access to specific historical data or reports on the mining restructuring program, it is challenging to verify each of these points with absolute certainty. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate historical records and reports, it appears to be detailed and specific, which lends credibility to its accuracy.

Given the specificity and the lack of contradictory information, the claim seems to be well-supported and likely accurate.

This requires specific data on the funding amounts for cultural events in both years.

Without access to the actual financial data for cultural events in 2013 and 2015, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and comprehensive financial records, we can analyze the statement logically.

The claim states that ""more money was provided for all (cultural) events organized in 2015 than was the case in 2013."" This means that every single cultural event in 2015 received more funding than any cultural event in 2013. If even one cultural event in 2015 received the same or less funding than a similar event in 2013, the claim would be false.

Given the absolute nature of the claim (""all cultural events""), it is highly unlikely that every single event in 2015 received more funding than in 2013 without exception. Therefore, unless there is concrete evidence to support this absolute statement, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is not entirely accurate.

Given that I do not have access to real-time data or specific records from law enforcement agencies, I cannot definitively verify the exact numbers mentioned in the claim. However, if we assume the numbers provided are accurate and there is no additional context or information that contradicts them, the claim would be considered accurate.

1. **Legal Framework**: The legitimacy of the HJC's work depends on the legal framework governing its composition and functioning. If the law requires a complete composition for the HJC to operate legitimately, then an incomplete composition could indeed render its work illegitimate.

2. **Current Composition**: We need to verify the current composition of the HJC and whether it meets the legal requirements. If the HJC is operating with fewer members than legally mandated, this could support the claim.

3. **Judicial and Governmental Statements**: Official statements or rulings from judicial or governmental bodies regarding the legitimacy of the HJC's current composition would be crucial. If there are authoritative declarations that the HJC's work is illegitimate due to its incomplete composition, this would further substantiate the claim.

Without specific details on the legal requirements for the HJC's composition and any official statements or rulings on its current status, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the legal framework indeed requires a complete composition and the HJC is currently incomplete, the claim could be considered accurate.

1. **Bill Gates and Population Reduction**: Bill Gates has spoken about reducing population growth through improved health care, access to vaccines, and family planning, which can lead to lower birth rates as child mortality decreases and families choose to have fewer children. This is not the same as calling for a reduction in the existing population.

2. **Funding the Development of the Coronavirus**: There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Bill Gates funded the development of the coronavirus. The origins of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are still under investigation, but the majority of scientific evidence points to a natural origin.

1. **Historical Context**: When a country joins a union (such as the European Union), there can be an initial surge in emigration due to new opportunities and freedoms. This is often observed as people take advantage of new rights to live and work in other member states.

2. **Current Trends**: Over time, emigration rates can stabilize as the initial wave of emigrants settles and the population adjusts to the new circumstances.

Out of 100 units of so-called primary energy, we efficiently use only several. The remaining part dissipates during the stages of energy conversion, transportation, and reception.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the key points and verify them against reliable data:

1. **Poland’s economy is almost twice as energy-intensive as the European average**:
   - Energy intensity is typically measured as the amount of energy consumption per unit of GDP. According to data from sources like Eurostat, Poland's energy intensity is indeed higher than the European average, though the exact factor can vary. It is plausible that Poland's energy intensity could be nearly twice the European average, but this would need specific data for precise confirmation.

2. **Out of 100 units of so-called primary energy, we efficiently use only several**:
   - This statement suggests a very low efficiency in energy use. Primary energy refers to raw fuels that are converted into usable energy. The efficiency of energy use can vary widely depending on the technology and infrastructure in place. While it is true that there are significant losses in energy conversion, transportation, and reception, the claim that only ""several"" units out of 100 are efficiently used seems exaggerated. Typically, energy efficiency rates are higher than just a few percent, even in less efficient systems.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also exaggerates certain aspects, particularly the efficiency of energy use.

If the audiovisual fee is charged based on the length of cable or wiring (measured in meters) rather than the number of television sets, then the claim would be accurate. However, if the fee is typically charged per television set or in some other manner, the claim would be inaccurate.

Without specific information or context about the audiovisual fee in question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the phrasing, it seems unusual for an audiovisual fee to be charged per meter rather than per television set, which is a more common practice.

VAERS is a passive reporting system in the United States that collects and analyzes data on adverse events that occur after the administration of vaccines. It is co-managed by the CDC and the FDA. 

Key points to consider:
1. **VAERS Data**: VAERS accepts reports from anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, or family members. The reports can include any adverse event that occurs after vaccination, regardless of whether the vaccine is suspected to have caused the event.
2. **Causality**: Reports to VAERS do not imply causation. The data collected is used to identify potential safety concerns that may require further investigation.
3. **Verification**: The numbers reported in VAERS are not verified cases of adverse events caused by vaccines. They are simply reports that need further scientific evaluation.

Given these points, the claim that ""3,000 people became disabled, 480 died, more than 300 developed cervical dysplasia, and more than 400 developed cervical cancer"" after receiving the HPV vaccine from 2006 to 2019 in the USA is based on raw VAERS data. However, these numbers do not establish a causal relationship between the HPV vaccine and these adverse events.

**Analysis**:
- The numbers might be present in VAERS, but they are not verified or confirmed to be caused by the HPV vaccine.
- The claim does not provide context about the nature of VAERS data and its limitations.

1. **Historical Relations**: Poland and Israel have had a complex relationship, but in recent years, they have cooperated on various fronts, including economic, cultural, and political matters. Poland has often shown support for Israel in international forums.

2. **UN Security Council Votes**: The claim specifically mentions a recent abstention by Poland in a UN Security Council vote, which is framed as a form of support for Israel. Abstaining from a vote can indeed be interpreted as a way to avoid opposing a country, thus indirectly supporting it.

Given these points, the claim that Poland has been an ally of Israel in many matters for many years and that Poland's recent abstention in a UN Security Council vote was a form of support for Israel is largely accurate. However, the term ""many years"" can be subjective, and the nature of international relations can be complex and multifaceted.

1. **Data on Girls in ICT in Serbia**: According to various reports and initiatives, Serbia has made significant strides in promoting ICT education among girls. Programs like ""Girls in ICT Day"" and other educational initiatives have been successful in increasing the number of girls pursuing ICT careers.

2. **Comparative Data with EU Countries**: The European Union has also been actively working to increase female participation in the ICT sector. Countries like Sweden, Finland, and Estonia have strong ICT sectors with significant female participation. The European Commission's ""Women in Digital"" scoreboard provides insights into the gender gap in digital skills and employment across EU countries.

3. **Long-term Projections**: The claim that it will take EU countries ""decades to catch up"" is speculative and difficult to substantiate. While Serbia may have a high rate of girls in ICT, the EU's ongoing efforts and investments in gender equality in the digital sector suggest that the gap may not necessarily take decades to close.

Given the available information, the claim that Serbia is a leader in Europe in the number of girls in the ICT sector is somewhat supported by data, but the assertion that it will take EU countries decades to catch up is more speculative and less substantiated.

In Finland, Veikkaus Oy is the state-owned gambling company that operates lotteries, sports betting, and other gambling activities. The profits from Veikkaus are indeed directed towards various public interest activities, including sports, physical culture, arts, and culture.

According to available data, Veikkaus has historically contributed significant amounts of money to these sectors. For instance, in 2020 alone, Veikkaus distributed around 1.1 billion euros (approximately 1.2 billion dollars) to various beneficiaries, including sports, arts, science, and youth work.

Given this information, the claim that over 1 billion dollars from lottery activities through the operator have been directed towards the development of sports and physical culture, as well as arts and culture, is accurate.

"„Nisam nju pomenuo, ja sam samo rekao – ‘dobre ljude ne ujedaju psi’.“",false,sr,"""I didn't mention her, I just said – 'good people are not bitten by dogs'.""","To determine the truthfulness of the claim ""I didn't mention her, I just said – 'good people are not bitten by dogs',"" we need to analyze the statement in two parts:

1. ""I didn't mention her"": This part of the statement asserts that the speaker did not directly refer to a specific person.
2. ""I just said – 'good people are not bitten by dogs'"": This part of the statement claims that the speaker made a general statement about good people and dogs.

The truthfulness of the overall claim depends on whether the general statement about good people and dogs can be interpreted as indirectly referring to the person in question. If the context suggests that the general statement was intended to imply something about the person, then the claim might be misleading.

Given that the statement ""good people are not bitten by dogs"" could be interpreted as an indirect reference to the person (implying that if someone was bitten by a dog, they are not a good person), the claim ""I didn't mention her"" could be seen as technically true but contextually misleading.

1. **Admission of Poor Political Management**: The speaker admits to not managing well in politics. This is a subjective statement and can be considered true based on the speaker's own assessment.

2. **Response to Senseless Accusations**: The speaker claims they did not know how to respond to senseless accusations. This is also subjective and can be considered true based on the speaker's perspective.

3. **No Criticism of City Management**: The speaker asserts that no one criticized their management of the city, including no accusations of rigged tenders or wrong investments. This is an objective claim that would require evidence or lack thereof to verify. If there is no public record or credible source indicating criticism or accusations of mismanagement, this part of the claim could be considered true.

Without specific evidence to the contrary, the claim appears to be a mix of subjective self-assessment and an objective statement that, if unchallenged, can be taken at face value.

„Ukoliko ne budemo uspeli da ostvarimo veći rast od 2 odsto u ovoj godini to će za nas i dalje biti vrlo slično godini krize jer se neće poimati veći osećaj nekog boljitka koji se ostvario.“,true,sr,"""If we do not manage to achieve a growth rate higher than 2 percent this year, it will still be very similar to a crisis year for us because there will not be a greater sense of improvement that has been realized.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and the implications of the statement. The claim suggests that achieving a growth rate higher than 2 percent is crucial for avoiding a situation that feels like a crisis year. 

1. **Economic Context**: In many economies, a growth rate of 2 percent is considered modest. For some countries, especially those with higher growth expectations, a rate below this threshold might indeed feel like stagnation or a crisis.

2. **Perception of Improvement**: The statement hinges on the perception of improvement. If the economy has been growing at a higher rate in previous years, a drop to 2 percent or below could be perceived negatively, even if it is not technically a crisis.

3. **Relative Comparison**: The term ""crisis year"" is subjective and relative. For an economy used to higher growth rates, a significant drop could feel like a crisis, even if it is not a recession or an actual economic crisis.

Given these points, the claim can be seen as a subjective assessment based on the perception of economic performance relative to expectations. It is not an absolute statement of fact but rather an opinion that could hold true under certain conditions.

Вероятность умереть после прививки в тысячи раз выше чем вероятность умереть от кори,false,ru,The probability of dying after vaccination is thousands of times higher than the probability of dying from measles.,"Final Answer: False

The claim that ""the probability of dying after vaccination is thousands of times higher than the probability of dying from measles"" is not supported by scientific evidence. Vaccines, including the measles vaccine, are extensively tested for safety and efficacy. The risk of serious adverse effects, including death, from vaccines is extremely low. On the other hand, measles can be a severe disease, especially in unvaccinated populations, and can lead to serious complications and death. The benefits of vaccination in preventing measles and its complications far outweigh the minimal risks associated with the vaccine.",false,True,False

In a situation where 70% of people in southern Poland heat this way.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. The impact of the anti-smog law on the use of coal stoves.
2. The percentage of people in southern Poland who heat their homes with coal stoves.

1. **Impact of the Anti-Smog Law**: Anti-smog laws typically aim to reduce air pollution by restricting the use of high-emission heating sources, such as coal stoves. If the law is stringent, it could indeed largely eliminate the possibility of heating with coal stoves.

2. **Percentage of People Heating with Coal Stoves in Southern Poland**: According to various reports and studies, a significant portion of households in southern Poland, particularly in regions like Silesia and Lesser Poland, do rely on coal for heating. However, the exact percentage can vary. Some sources suggest that a high percentage of households in these areas use coal, but it may not be as high as 70%.

Given these points, the claim seems to have a basis in reality but may slightly overstate the percentage of people using coal stoves.

They simply did not allow me to promote anything,"" we need to consider the context and evidence surrounding the statement. Without specific details about who ""they"" are, the circumstances, and any relevant policies or rules, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.

However, if we assume the statement is made in a context where there are strict rules or policies against self-promotion, such as in certain professional environments, social media platforms, or specific organizations, the claim could be accurate. Conversely, if there is evidence that the person was allowed some form of promotion or that the restrictions were not absolute, the claim might be less accurate.

Given the lack of specific context and evidence, the most balanced assessment would be:

According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2022, Kazakhstan is indeed listed among the top countries with significant coal reserves. However, the exact ranking can vary slightly depending on the source and the year of the data.

Based on the most recent data available from these sources, Kazakhstan is generally ranked around 9th in the world for proven coal reserves. This ranking can be considered accurate within a reasonable margin of error.

1. The total value of arms and military equipment exports before the new contract.
2. The value of the new contract.
3. The combined total of these values to see if it approximates 1.2 billion dollars.

Without specific data on the existing exports and the new contract, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the information provided is accurate and the combined total indeed amounts to around 1.2 billion dollars, the claim would be 'True'. If there is some minor discrepancy but it is still close to 1.2 billion dollars, it might be 'Mostly True'. Significant discrepancies would lead to 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on the extent of the difference.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact figures, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the provided information is accurate and there are no significant discrepancies, the claim would be:

Jest to największy rząd w historii.,false,pl,This is the largest government in history.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""This is the largest government in history,"" we need to consider various factors such as the size of the government in terms of budget, number of employees, scope of influence, and other metrics.

1. **Budget**: The U.S. federal budget has grown significantly over time, and in recent years, it has reached unprecedented levels. For example, the budget for the fiscal year 2022 was over $6 trillion, which is historically high.

2. **Number of Employees**: The number of federal employees has also increased over time, although not always at the same rate as the budget. As of recent data, the federal government employs millions of people, but this number has fluctuated over the decades.

3. **Scope of Influence**: The scope and reach of the federal government have expanded significantly over time, encompassing more areas of public life and regulation.

4. **Historical Context**: Comparing the size of the government today to historical governments can be complex. For example, the Roman Empire or the British Empire at their peaks had vast administrative structures, but the metrics for comparison (such as budget and number of employees) are not directly comparable due to differences in economic systems, population sizes, and administrative technologies.

Given these considerations, the claim can be seen as having some basis in truth, particularly when considering the budget and scope of influence. However, it may not be entirely accurate when considering the number of employees or when comparing to historical empires in a different context.

1. OLAF (European Anti-Fraud Office) is indeed an EU institution responsible for investigating fraud involving EU funds.
2. OLAF's report should specifically state that in Poland, one in four tenders is rigged.

First, let's confirm OLAF's role. OLAF is indeed responsible for investigating fraud, corruption, and other illegal activities involving EU funds.

Next, we need to verify if OLAF's report contains the specific claim about Poland. According to OLAF's reports and public statements, there have been concerns about fraud and irregularities in various EU member states, including Poland. However, the specific claim that ""one in four tenders is rigged"" in Poland would need to be directly sourced from an OLAF report or official statement.

Without direct access to the latest OLAF report or a specific statement confirming this exact statistic, it is challenging to verify the precise claim. However, OLAF has reported significant issues with public procurement and tenders in various countries, including Poland.

Given the information available, the claim seems to be an interpretation or an extrapolation rather than a direct quote from OLAF.

This data would typically include metrics such as capital expenditures, research and development spending, and other forms of business investment.

Without access to specific and up-to-date data, it is not possible to definitively verify or refute the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on reliable and current data sources, we can make an educated guess.

Given the context of recent global economic challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions, it is plausible that enterprise investments could be significantly impacted. However, whether they are at their lowest level in over 20 years would require specific data points for confirmation.

Since we do not have the exact data to verify this claim, we cannot definitively categorize it as 'True' or 'False'. Therefore, the most appropriate response based on the available information would be:

The claim is a statement about the speaker's lack of knowledge regarding the identity and origin of a person.

If the speaker genuinely has no information about the person in question, then the claim would be 'True'. However, if the speaker has some knowledge but is exaggerating their ignorance, the claim could be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

1. **Number of Jobs in Manufacturing Industry**: The claim states that the number of jobs increased by only 46,000.
2. **Average Salary in Dollar Terms**: The claim states that the average salary fell by 25%.

Without access to the specific historical data for the second five-year plan, it is challenging to verify these exact figures. However, if we assume the second five-year plan refers to a specific historical period (such as the Soviet Union's second five-year plan from 1933 to 1937), we would need to consult historical economic records from that period to confirm the accuracy of these statements.

Given the lack of specific data verification in this context, we cannot definitively categorize the claim as 'True' or 'False'. However, if we assume the claim is based on some historical data, but we cannot verify the exact figures, the most cautious approach would be to categorize it as 'Half True' due to the potential for partial accuracy.

1. Whether imported carpets in Uzbekistan are subject to excise tax.
2. Whether Uzbek producers of exported carpets are entitled to a VAT refund.

1. **Excise Tax on Imported Carpets:**
   - In Uzbekistan, excise taxes are typically levied on certain goods, including luxury items, alcohol, and tobacco. However, carpets are not commonly listed among the items subject to excise tax. Instead, imported goods are generally subject to customs duties and VAT.

2. **VAT Refund for Exported Carpets:**
   - According to Uzbekistan's tax regulations, exporters are generally entitled to a VAT refund on goods exported out of the country. This is a common practice to encourage exports and ensure that VAT is not a cost to the exporter.

Given this information:

- The claim that imported carpets are subject to excise tax is likely incorrect, as carpets are not typically subject to excise tax in Uzbekistan.
- The claim that Uzbek producers of exported carpets are entitled to a VAT refund is correct, as this aligns with standard export tax practices.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the excise tax on imported carpets.

1. **Promise of Reduction in Taxes and Parafiscal Charges**: Did the government indeed promise a reduction in taxes and parafiscal charges three years ago?
2. **Number of Taxes and Parafiscal Charges**: Was the number of taxes and parafiscal charges 360 three years ago, and has it increased to 384 now?
3. **Impact of the Law on Private Security**: Will the adoption of the Law on Private Security indeed add one more tax, making the total 385?

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, we can only assess the claim based on the logical consistency and typical practices in governmental policy changes.

1. **Promise of Reduction**: Governments often make promises regarding tax reductions, so this part of the claim is plausible.
2. **Number of Taxes and Parafiscal Charges**: The increase from 360 to 384 suggests a net addition of 24 taxes or charges over three years. This is a specific and verifiable claim, but without data, we cannot confirm its accuracy.
3. **Law on Private Security**: If the law introduces a new tax, it would logically add to the total count.

2. **Inflation Rate**: This is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation, and avoid deflation, in order to keep the economy running smoothly.

The claim states that the dinar interest rate is ""much higher"" than the inflation rate. For this to be true, the interest rate on savings in dinars must indeed be significantly higher than the current inflation rate.

Reports and official documents from recent years suggest that the budget for oncological treatment is significantly higher than 1.5 billion PLN. For instance, in 2020, the NFZ allocated around 11 billion PLN for oncological care.

4. **Mostly False**: If there is significant evidence suggesting the person did make such a statement, but there is some room for doubt or misinterpretation.
5. **False**: If there is clear and direct evidence that the person did make the statement.

Without specific evidence, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. Therefore, I must refrain from making a final judgment.

"„Kada sam postao premijer, javni dug izražen u procentima bruto domaćeg proizvoda iznosio je, u zavisnosti od toga koji trenutak uzimate, od 77 do 79 odsto, a pre kraja godine nivo javnog duga biće ispod 50 odsto.“",false,sr,"""When I became Prime Minister, the public debt expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic product was, depending on the moment you take, between 77 and 79 percent, and before the end of the year, the level of public debt will be below 50 percent.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The public debt as a percentage of GDP when the individual became Prime Minister.
2. The projected public debt as a percentage of GDP before the end of the year.

Without specific details about the country, the Prime Minister in question, and the time period referenced, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to verify this information:

1. **Historical Data on Public Debt**: Look up historical data on the country's public debt as a percentage of GDP at the time the individual became Prime Minister. This information is typically available from government financial reports, central banks, or international financial organizations like the IMF or World Bank.

2. **Current and Projected Public Debt**: Check the most recent financial reports or economic forecasts to see the current level of public debt and the projections for the end of the year.

If the data confirms that the public debt was indeed between 77 and 79 percent of GDP when the individual became Prime Minister and is projected to fall below 50 percent by the end of the year, the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows some discrepancies but is generally in line with the claim, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. Significant discrepancies would lead to 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and typical economic reporting, it seems plausible but requires verification.

Thus, five domestic investors and for every euro invested, it returns four times to the budget and is strictly monitored.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate several aspects:

1. **Subsidy Policy**: The claim states that the subsidy policy of the Government of the Republic of Serbia is ""well thought out and smart."" This is a subjective statement and can vary based on different perspectives and criteria for what constitutes a ""well thought out and smart"" policy.

2. **Return on Investment**: The claim asserts that for every euro invested, it returns four times to the budget. This is a specific and quantifiable statement. To verify this, we would need access to detailed financial reports and analyses from the Serbian government or independent economic studies that confirm this return on investment.

3. **Monitoring**: The claim mentions that the investment is ""strictly monitored."" This would require evidence of robust oversight mechanisms and transparency in the subsidy allocation and utilization process.

Without access to specific data and independent verification, it is challenging to fully validate the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and the need for evidence to support the specific return on investment and monitoring aspects, we can make an informed judgment.

**Evaluation**:
- The subjective nature of the policy being ""well thought out and smart"" cannot be definitively proven or disproven without subjective analysis.
- The specific return on investment (4 times) is a strong claim that requires empirical evidence.
- The assertion of strict monitoring also requires evidence of oversight mechanisms.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim and the need for independent verification, the claim can be considered partially supported but not fully verifiable.

1. **Constitutional Tribunal Ruling in 2011**: We need to confirm if there was a ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal in 2011 related to the registration of symbols.
2. **Symbols of the NOP**: The NOP (National Rebirth of Poland) is a far-right political party in Poland. We need to check if the symbols mentioned, such as the Celtic cross, were part of the ruling.
3. **Constitutional Violations**: We need to verify if the ruling stated that there were no constitutional violations in registering these symbols.
4. **Court Registration**: We need to confirm if the court had to register the symbols following the ruling.

Upon researching, it appears that in 2011, the Constitutional Tribunal of Poland did indeed make a ruling regarding the symbols of the NOP, including the Celtic cross. The Tribunal did not find these symbols to be in violation of the constitution, which led to their registration.

However, the phrase ""No Pedaling Allowed"" seems to be a misunderstanding or misrepresentation. The NOP's symbols and the Celtic cross are associated with far-right ideologies, not with the phrase ""No Pedaling Allowed.""

Połowa budżetu to jest z VAT-u.,false,pl,Half of the budget comes from VAT.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Half of the budget comes from VAT,"" we need to consider the context and the specific budget being referred to. VAT (Value Added Tax) is a significant source of revenue for many governments, but it is rarely the sole or even the primary source of funding for an entire budget.

1. **National Budgets**: In most countries, national budgets are funded through a combination of various taxes, including income tax, corporate tax, VAT, excise duties, and other sources. VAT typically constitutes a significant portion but not usually half of the total budget.

2. **European Union Budget**: For the EU, VAT-based contributions are one of the sources of revenue, but they do not make up half of the budget. The EU budget is funded through a combination of traditional own resources (customs duties), VAT-based contributions, and Gross National Income (GNI)-based contributions.

3. **Specific Country Examples**:
   - **United Kingdom**: According to HM Treasury, VAT contributes a significant portion of tax revenue, but it is not half of the total budget.
   - **United States**: The U.S. does not have a federal VAT; its budget is primarily funded through income taxes, payroll taxes, and corporate taxes.

Given this information, the claim that ""Half of the budget comes from VAT"" is generally not accurate for most national or supranational budgets.

„Srbija je danas dalja od EU nego što je bila pre dve godine.“,false,sr,"""Serbia is further from the EU today than it was two years ago.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Serbia is further from the EU today than it was two years ago,"" we need to consider several factors, including Serbia's progress or setbacks in meeting the European Union's accession criteria, political developments, and statements from EU officials.

1. **Accession Criteria and Progress**: The EU accession process involves meeting specific criteria, including political stability, economic performance, and adherence to EU laws and standards. If Serbia has made significant progress in these areas over the past two years, the claim would be less accurate. Conversely, if there have been setbacks or stagnation, the claim might hold more weight.

2. **Political Developments**: Political events, such as changes in government, policy shifts, or regional tensions, can impact Serbia's EU accession prospects. For instance, if there have been political developments that the EU views negatively, this could hinder Serbia's progress.

3. **Statements from EU Officials**: Official statements from EU representatives or reports from the European Commission can provide insights into Serbia's current standing in the accession process. If recent reports or statements indicate that Serbia's progress has stalled or regressed, this would support the claim.

Based on available information up to 2023, there have been mixed signals regarding Serbia's EU accession progress. While there have been ongoing efforts to meet EU criteria, there have also been concerns about issues such as rule of law, media freedom, and regional relations, particularly with Kosovo.

Given these considerations, the claim that ""Serbia is further from the EU today than it was two years ago"" can be seen as having some basis in reality, but it may not fully capture the complexity of the situation.

1. The individual in question has participated in the last four rounds of elections.
2. The individual has received more votes in each successive election.
3. The Serbian Progressive Party has also received more votes in each successive election.

Without specific data on the election results for the individual and the Serbian Progressive Party, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is about a prominent political figure like Aleksandar Vučić and the Serbian Progressive Party, we can look at historical election data:

- Aleksandar Vučić and the Serbian Progressive Party have seen significant electoral success in recent years.
- Vučić has been a dominant figure in Serbian politics, and the party has won a substantial number of votes in multiple elections.

However, to confirm the exact trend of increasing votes in each of the last four elections, detailed election results would be necessary.

1. **Time Frame**: The specific six-month period being referenced.
2. **Location**: Incidents in both Belgrade and the broader region of Serbia.
3. **Nature of Incidents**: Whether any killings during this period can be classified as mafia-related.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, we cannot definitively verify or refute the claim. However, if we assume the statement is based on recent and accurate information from reliable sources, we can make an educated guess.

If recent reports and crime statistics from credible sources (e.g., law enforcement agencies, news outlets) indicate that there have indeed been no mafia-related killings in Belgrade or Serbia over the specified six-month period, the claim could be considered accurate.

Without concrete evidence to support or refute the claim, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

The claim states that the rating is consistently higher than Italy's and exactly at the same level as Spain's.

1. **Identify the Rating**: The claim does not specify which rating is being referred to. It could be economic, credit, quality of life, or any other metric. For the sake of this analysis, let's assume it refers to a commonly compared metric like credit rating or economic ranking.

2. **Check Consistency**: The claim mentions that the rating is ""consistently"" higher than Italy's. This implies a trend over a period of time, not just a single instance.

3. **Compare with Spain**: The claim also states that the rating is ""exactly at the same level as Spain."" This requires the rating to be identical to Spain's at the time of comparison.

Without specific data or a clear indication of which rating is being discussed, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge:

- **Credit Ratings**: As of recent years, credit ratings from agencies like Moody's, S&P, and Fitch often show Italy and Spain having similar ratings, with slight variations. It is not consistently true that one is always higher than the other.
- **Economic Rankings**: GDP and other economic indicators also fluctuate, and while Spain and Italy are often close, one is not consistently higher than the other.

Given the lack of specificity and the general trends observed, the claim appears to be an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

However, as the pandemic progressed, the number of cases worldwide, including in China, increased significantly. By late 2022 and into 2023, China experienced significant outbreaks, especially after lifting its strict ""zero-COVID"" policies, leading to millions of infections.

1. Mikalai Statkevich's candidacy in the presidential election five years ago.
2. Whether Mikalai Statkevich is currently in prison.

Mikalai Statkevich is a well-known opposition figure in Belarus. He has run for president in the past, notably in the 2010 election. However, the claim specifies ""five years ago,"" which would refer to the 2018 period. The most recent presidential election before 2023 was in 2020, not 2018. Statkevich was indeed a candidate in the 2020 election, but he was arrested before the election took place.

As of the latest information available, Mikalai Statkevich remains imprisoned. He was sentenced to a lengthy prison term following his arrest in 2020.

Given this context, the claim that Mikalai Statkevich, a candidate from the presidential election five years ago, is still in prison is not entirely accurate because the timeline is slightly off. The correct timeline is three years ago, not five.

I to ne samo u košarci i vaterpolu, već i u ekonomiji i politici.“",false,sr,"""Three years ago, Serbia was on the brink of bankruptcy, but today it has a budget surplus, economic growth significantly higher than the European average, and Serbia has shown that it knows how to win. And not just in basketball and water polo, but also in the economy and politics.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate several aspects:

1. **Economic Status Three Years Ago**: We need to verify if Serbia was indeed on the brink of bankruptcy three years ago.
2. **Current Budget Surplus**: We need to check if Serbia currently has a budget surplus.
3. **Economic Growth**: We need to compare Serbia's current economic growth rate with the European average.
4. **Achievements in Economy and Politics**: We need to assess Serbia's recent achievements in the economy and politics.

### Analysis:

1. **Economic Status Three Years Ago**:
   - In 2017, Serbia was facing significant economic challenges, including high public debt and fiscal deficits. However, it was not universally described as being on the brink of bankruptcy. The country was undergoing fiscal consolidation and structural reforms.

2. **Current Budget Surplus**:
   - As of recent reports, Serbia has managed to achieve a budget surplus. The government has implemented measures to control public spending and increase revenues, leading to a positive fiscal balance.

3. **Economic Growth**:
   - Serbia's economic growth has been relatively strong in recent years. For instance, in 2019, Serbia's GDP growth was around 4.2%, which is higher than the EU average growth rate of approximately 1.5% for the same period.

4. **Achievements in Economy and Politics**:
   - Serbia has made notable progress in economic reforms and has improved its business environment. Politically, the country has been working towards EU accession, although it faces challenges related to governance and rule of law.

### Conclusion:
The claim contains elements of truth but also some exaggeration. Serbia was not exactly on the brink of bankruptcy three years ago, but it did face significant economic challenges. The country has achieved a budget surplus and has experienced economic growth higher than the European average. The statement about winning in economy and politics is more subjective but reflects some real progress.

W czasach stanu wojennego prawie 800 tys. Polaków opuściło Polskę.,false,pl,"During the martial law period, almost 800,000 Poles left Poland.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""During the martial law period, almost 800,000 Poles left Poland,"" we need to consider historical data and context.

Martial law in Poland was declared on December 13, 1981, and lasted until July 22, 1983. This period was marked by significant political repression and economic hardship, which did lead to increased emigration. However, the figure of 800,000 seems quite high for this specific period.

Historical records indicate that while there was a notable increase in emigration during and after the martial law period, the number of Poles who left the country during those specific years is generally estimated to be lower than 800,000. Some sources suggest that the total number of Poles who emigrated during the entire decade of the 1980s, which includes the martial law period, might approach that figure, but not during the martial law period alone.

Given this context, the claim appears to be an overestimation if it is strictly referring to the martial law period from 1981 to 1983.

Германская комиссия – коронавирус – глобальная ложная тревога,false,ru,The German commission – coronavirus – global false alarm.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The German commission – coronavirus – global false alarm,"" we need to examine the context and the sources of this statement.

1. **German Commission**: There is no official German commission that has declared the coronavirus pandemic a ""global false alarm."" However, there have been individual voices and groups in Germany, such as the ""Corona Extra-Parliamentary Inquiry Committee"" (ACU), which have made claims downplaying the severity of the pandemic. These groups are not official government bodies and their views do not represent the consensus of the scientific community or the German government.

2. **Scientific Consensus**: The overwhelming consensus among global health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Robert Koch Institute (Germany's federal government agency and research institute responsible for disease control and prevention), is that COVID-19 is a serious and ongoing global health crisis. The pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths and significant social and economic disruption worldwide.

3. **Misinformation**: Claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a ""global false alarm"" are generally considered misinformation. These claims often stem from conspiracy theories or misinterpretations of data and are not supported by credible scientific evidence.

Given the lack of support from credible sources and the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the claim that a German commission has declared the coronavirus a ""global false alarm"" is not accurate.

- Total children enrolled in kindergartens: 23,000

Adding the numbers for public and private kindergartens:

1. The current and proposed amounts of direct payments.
2. The timeline for the increase (i.e., if it is indeed happening this year).
3. The source of this information (e.g., official announcements from the relevant ministry).

Without access to specific and up-to-date information from the relevant ministry or official announcements, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the information provided is based on a reliable source, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on an official announcement, it appears to be a straightforward statement about a policy change. If there is no contradictory information available, it is reasonable to consider the claim as accurate.

1. **Reports and Data**: Various reports, including those from organizations like Global Financial Integrity (GFI), have highlighted significant illicit financial flows from Kazakhstan. These reports often indicate that Kazakhstan has substantial issues with capital flight and money laundering.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: When comparing Kazakhstan to other Central Asian countries (such as Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan), Kazakhstan's larger economy and higher levels of foreign investment and trade make it more susceptible to larger volumes of illicit financial flows.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Experts and analysts often point to Kazakhstan's relatively more developed financial system and greater integration into the global economy as factors contributing to higher levels of illegal capital outflow compared to its neighbors.

Given this context, the claim appears to be supported by available evidence, though it is important to note that precise figures can be difficult to obtain due to the secretive nature of illegal financial activities.

2. **The number of people going to soup kitchens**: The claim states that there are 10,000 people who go to soup kitchens.

Without specific data or context about the political situation and the number of people using soup kitchens, it is challenging to verify the exact numbers. However, if we assume the claim is based on some factual data, we can consider the following:

- If DS has indeed been in power for 16 years, that part of the claim could be true.
- The number of people going to soup kitchens (10,000) would need to be verified with reliable sources or statistics.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact numbers, the claim could be considered as having some basis in reality but not fully verifiable without additional information.

2. **Financial Stability**: A stable financial environment is crucial for investors. If the country offers greater financial stability than its neighbors, this would be a significant advantage.

3. **Workforce and Quality**: The availability of a skilled and efficient workforce can be a major draw for investors. If the country has a better-trained or more productive workforce than surrounding countries, this would also be a positive factor.

Given that the claim is conditional on these factors being more favorable in the country compared to its neighbors, and assuming these conditions are met, the claim would be accurate. However, without specific data to confirm these conditions, we can only assess the claim based on the general logic and typical factors that influence investment decisions.

Additionally, we need to check if these are the only recognitions that happened during that period.

1. **Recognition by Antigua and Barbuda**: Antigua and Barbuda recognized Kosovo's independence on November 20, 2018.
2. **Recognition by Togo**: Togo recognized Kosovo's independence on July 24, 2014.

Next, we need to identify the tenure of the person making the claim. If the person took over the government after these dates, then the recognitions by Antigua and Barbuda and Togo would not fall under their tenure.

If the person took over the government before these dates, then the claim could be accurate, provided no other countries recognized Kosovo's independence during their tenure.

Given the information, if the person took over the government after November 20, 2018, the claim would be false. If they took over before these dates and no other recognitions occurred during their tenure, the claim could be true.

3. **Penalties for Life**: Historically, in many pension systems, penalties for early retirement were indeed applied for life. This means that once you opted for early retirement, the reduced pension amount would continue throughout your retirement.

4. **Removal of Penalties at Age 65**: The claim states that now, when individuals meet the age requirement of 65, the penalties are removed. This is a specific policy detail that can vary by country and pension system. Some countries may have reformed their pension systems to remove penalties once the standard retirement age is reached, but this is not universally true for all countries.

Given these points, the claim appears to be a mix of accurate general statements and specific policy details that may not apply universally. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true but contains elements of truth.

"U Srbiji 90 odsto đaka posle srednje škole upisuje fakultet, a poznato je da u fabrikama nedostaju majstori.",mostly true,sr,"In Serbia, 90 percent of students enroll in college after high school, and it is known that factories lack skilled workers.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. **The percentage of students enrolling in college after high school in Serbia.**
2. **The situation regarding the lack of skilled workers in factories in Serbia.**

### Point 1: College Enrollment Rate
According to available data, the percentage of students enrolling in higher education in Serbia is not as high as 90%. The enrollment rate in tertiary education in Serbia is generally lower, often cited around 50-60%. Therefore, the claim that 90% of students enroll in college after high school appears to be an overestimation.

### Point 2: Lack of Skilled Workers
There have been reports and studies indicating that Serbia, like many other countries, faces a shortage of skilled workers in various industries, including manufacturing. This is a recognized issue and aligns with the claim.

### Conclusion
Given that the first part of the claim (90% college enrollment) is significantly overstated, while the second part (lack of skilled workers) is accurate, the overall claim is not entirely accurate but contains some truth.

Krakowiacy żyją najdłużej w całej Polsce.,false,pl,The people of Kraków live the longest in all of Poland.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The people of Kraków live the longest in all of Poland,"" we need to examine available data on life expectancy across different regions in Poland. Life expectancy can vary based on numerous factors, including healthcare quality, lifestyle, and socioeconomic conditions.

As of the latest available data, life expectancy in Poland can differ significantly between regions. While Kraków is known for its relatively high standard of living and good healthcare facilities, it is not definitively documented as having the highest life expectancy in the entire country. Other regions, such as Warsaw or certain areas in the west of Poland, may also have comparable or even higher life expectancies.

Given the lack of specific evidence confirming that Kraków has the absolute highest life expectancy in Poland, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

"„Odgovorno tvrdim ispred Ministarstva poljoprivrede da će ovogodišnji rod suncokreta biti između 300 i 320 hiljada tona, što je dovoljno za oko 130.000 tona jestivog ulja.“",true,sr,"""I responsibly assert on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture that this year's sunflower yield will be between 300,000 and 320,000 tons, which is enough for about 130,000 tons of edible oil.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The projected sunflower yield of 300,000 to 320,000 tons.
2. The conversion rate of sunflower seeds to edible oil, which should result in approximately 130,000 tons of edible oil.

First, let's consider the sunflower yield. If the Ministry of Agriculture has reliable data and historical trends to support the projection of 300,000 to 320,000 tons, this part of the claim could be accurate.

Second, the conversion rate of sunflower seeds to edible oil typically ranges from 35% to 45%. Using a conservative estimate of 40%:

- For 300,000 tons of sunflower seeds: 300,000 tons * 0.40 = 120,000 tons of edible oil.
- For 320,000 tons of sunflower seeds: 320,000 tons * 0.40 = 128,000 tons of edible oil.

Given this calculation, the claim that the yield will produce about 130,000 tons of edible oil is slightly optimistic but within a reasonable range.

Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate but slightly optimistic on the oil yield.

However, this is not entirely accurate. While Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union does state that the European Council elects its President by a qualified majority for a term of 2.5 years and that the mandate is renewable once, the renewal is not automatic. It requires a decision by the European Council, which means it involves a deliberate choice and vote.

Therefore, the claim that the mandate is ""simply renewable"" is misleading because it overlooks the necessity of a formal decision-making process for renewal.

1. **Economic Growth Rate Predictions**: The claim states that Serbia will have the economic growth rate as predicted by both the IMF and the World Bank. This part of the claim can be verified by checking the latest economic forecasts from these institutions.

2. **Comparison with Other European Countries**: The claim also states that Serbia is the only country in Europe with growth. This is a strong statement and requires verification against the economic performance of other European countries.

### Verification:

1. **IMF and World Bank Predictions**:
   - The IMF and World Bank regularly publish economic forecasts for countries, including Serbia. If their latest reports predict positive growth for Serbia, this part of the claim could be considered accurate.

2. **Economic Growth in Europe**:
   - To verify the claim that Serbia is the only country in Europe with growth, we need to look at the economic performance of other European countries. It is highly unlikely that Serbia would be the only country with positive growth, as many European countries have shown varying degrees of economic growth.

### Analysis:

- **IMF and World Bank Predictions**: If the latest reports from these institutions predict positive growth for Serbia, this part of the claim is likely true.
- **Comparison with Other European Countries**: It is highly improbable that Serbia is the only country in Europe experiencing growth. Many European countries have shown positive growth rates, especially in the context of recovery from economic downturns.

### Conclusion:

Given the improbability of Serbia being the only country in Europe with growth, the claim is exaggerated. While Serbia may have positive growth, it is not unique in this regard.

„Kurs dinara ostaće stabilan do kraja godine.“,mostly false,sr,"""The exchange rate of the dinar will remain stable until the end of the year.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The exchange rate of the dinar will remain stable until the end of the year,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Economic Data**: Exchange rates are influenced by a variety of economic indicators such as inflation rates, interest rates, and economic growth. If current data suggests stability, the claim might be more credible.

2. **Government and Central Bank Policies**: If the government or central bank has announced measures to stabilize the currency, this could support the claim.

3. **Historical Trends**: Past performance of the dinar's exchange rate can provide insights into its potential stability.

4. **External Factors**: Global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and market sentiment can all impact exchange rates unpredictably.

Without specific, up-to-date information on these factors, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, given the inherent unpredictability of exchange rates due to numerous influencing factors, it is generally difficult to assert with certainty that any currency will remain stable over a specific period.

The Tribunal ruled that the term of office of the members of the KRS could be shortened by law, provided that the law respects the principles of proper legislation and does not violate the principle of non-retroactivity.

Given that the claim states the ruling occurred in 2006, which is incorrect, but the essence of the ruling about the term being shortened is accurate, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains a significant element of truth.

1. **Position and Employment Suspension**: The individual claims to have been the president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia (PKS) and received a decision to suspend their employment upon being elected to a public office. This is a factual statement that can be verified through records from PKS and the relevant public office.

2. **Right and Obligation to Return**: The claim includes that there was a right and obligation to return to work at PKS after the term in public office ends. This would typically be outlined in employment policies or legal statutes governing such positions.

3. **Compliance with Law and Conflict of Interest**: The individual asserts that everything was done according to the law and that there is no conflict of interest. This would require an understanding of the specific laws and regulations in Serbia regarding employment suspension, public office, and conflict of interest.

Without specific evidence or legal documentation to confirm or refute these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the individual followed standard legal procedures and there are no known violations or conflicts of interest reported, the claim could be considered accurate.

Since the country is not specified in the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer without additional context or information.

However, if we assume the claim is referring to a specific country known for significant ecological risks, such as a country with extensive deforestation, desertification, or other environmental issues, the claim could be plausible. For example, countries like Brazil (due to deforestation in the Amazon) or regions in Africa (due to desertification) might have high percentages of their territory at risk.

Given the lack of specific information about the country in question, it is difficult to categorically verify the claim. Therefore, based on the general nature of the statement and the potential for it to be true in certain contexts, the most appropriate response would be:

1. **Political Landscape and Democracy**: Serbia is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system. It holds regular elections, and there are mechanisms for political participation. However, international organizations like Freedom House have noted issues with media freedom, political corruption, and the rule of law, which can undermine the democratic process.

2. **Presence of Extreme Groups**: Serbia has seen the presence of nationalist and far-right groups. While these groups do exist, their influence on mainstream politics has been limited compared to some other countries. However, they have occasionally succeeded in gaining attention and support, particularly during times of political or economic instability.

3. **Success of Extreme Groups**: While extreme groups have not dominated Serbian politics, they have had some success in influencing public discourse and policy, especially on issues related to nationalism and ethnic tensions. This suggests that while they may not ""succeed"" in a broad sense, they are not entirely without influence.

Given these points, the claim that Serbia is an open, democratic society where extreme groups cannot succeed is somewhat overstated. While Serbia has democratic institutions and processes, the influence of extreme groups cannot be entirely dismissed.

1. **Pension Policies**: Different countries and pension schemes have different policies regarding how pensions are adjusted. Some pensions are indexed to inflation, while others may be linked to wage growth or a combination of factors.

2. **Historical Trends**: Historically, some pension schemes have increased in line with wage growth, while others have not. This can depend on economic conditions, government policies, and the specific rules of the pension scheme.

3. **Economic Conditions**: Economic conditions such as inflation, wage growth, and government budget constraints can impact whether pensions increase in line with wages.

Given that the claim is a general statement and does not specify a particular country or pension scheme, it is difficult to assert its universal truth. However, many pension schemes do aim to increase pensions in line with wage growth to maintain retirees' purchasing power.

80 proc. poznaniaków to wierzący katolicy.,true,pl,80 percent of Poznań residents are devout Catholics.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""80 percent of Poznań residents are devout Catholics,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Religious Demographics in Poland**: Poland is predominantly Catholic, with a significant majority of the population identifying as Roman Catholic. According to various sources, around 85-90% of the Polish population identifies as Catholic.

2. **Religious Practice**: Identifying as Catholic does not necessarily equate to being a ""devout"" Catholic. Devoutness typically implies regular participation in religious services and adherence to religious practices.

3. **Local Data for Poznań**: Poznań, being a major city in Poland, is likely to reflect the national trend, but urban areas often have more religious diversity and varying levels of religious practice compared to rural areas.

4. **Surveys and Studies**: Specific data on the devoutness of Poznań residents might not be readily available, but general trends can be inferred from national surveys. For instance, a 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center found that about 40% of Polish Catholics attend church weekly, which is a common measure of devoutness.

Given these points, while a high percentage of Poznań residents may identify as Catholic, the claim that 80% are ""devout"" Catholics seems to overstate the level of religious practice.

2. **Closing Chapters**: Montenegro has provisionally closed 3 chapters.

Without access to the specific data for March, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on accurate and up-to-date information from a reliable source, we can evaluate it as follows:

- If the data shows a clear decrease in unemployment in March, the claim would be 'True.'
- If the data shows a decrease but with some minor discrepancies or additional context needed, it might be 'Mostly True.'
- If the data shows mixed results or only a slight decrease that could be interpreted differently, it might be 'Half True.'
- If the data shows no significant change or a slight increase, it might be 'Mostly False.'

There will be no wave of layoffs...""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The global economic crisis will not affect employment in Serbia. There will be no wave of layoffs,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Global Economic Impact**: Global economic crises typically have widespread effects, influencing economies around the world, including Serbia. These effects can include reduced demand for exports, decreased foreign investment, and disruptions in supply chains.

2. **Serbia's Economic Structure**: Serbia's economy is interconnected with the global market. Key sectors such as manufacturing, services, and exports are likely to be affected by global economic downturns.

3. **Historical Precedents**: Past global economic crises, such as the 2008 financial crisis, had significant impacts on employment in many countries, including Serbia. It is reasonable to expect that a new global economic crisis would similarly affect employment.

4. **Government Measures**: While government interventions and policies can mitigate some negative impacts, it is unlikely that they can completely shield the country from a global economic crisis.

Given these considerations, the claim that the global economic crisis will not affect employment in Serbia and that there will be no wave of layoffs is overly optimistic and does not align with historical and economic evidence.

1. **Significant Progress of the Parliament**: The European Commission's report often highlights areas where progress has been made, as well as areas needing improvement. If the report specifically mentions significant progress in the functioning, transparency, and effectiveness of the Serbian parliament, this part of the claim could be considered accurate.

2. **Assembly as an Institution Up to the European Task**: This part of the claim suggests that the Serbian parliament meets the standards expected by the European Union. If the report indicates that the parliament has made substantial improvements and aligns well with EU standards, this part of the claim could also be considered accurate.

Without the specific details from the latest European Commission's report, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

1. **Definition of Recession**: A recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. Emerging from a recession would generally mean that the country has returned to positive GDP growth.

2. **GDP Growth**: The claim states that GDP growth in the first quarter of the current year was one percent higher than in the same period in 2009. This indicates a positive change in GDP, which is a good sign.

3. **Context and Duration**: While a one percent increase in GDP is positive, it is a relatively small growth rate. Emerging from a recession usually requires sustained positive growth over multiple quarters, not just a single quarter.

4. **Other Economic Indicators**: To fully confirm that a country has emerged from a recession, other economic indicators such as employment rates, industrial production, and consumer confidence should also be considered.

Given these points, the claim that Serbia has emerged from the recession based solely on a one percent GDP growth in a single quarter is somewhat overstated. While it is a positive sign, it does not fully confirm that the recession is over.

Without additional context or evidence, we cannot definitively verify the person's innocence or the content of the statements made by all the accused. Therefore, we cannot fully validate the claim.

In Germany:
- Mothers are entitled to 14 weeks of maternity leave (6 weeks before the birth and 8 weeks after).
- Parents can take up to 3 years of parental leave, during which their job is protected. This leave can be taken by either parent or shared between them.
- During the first 12 to 14 months of parental leave, parents can receive parental allowance (Elterngeld), which is a percentage of their previous income.

In many other countries, including some European countries, maternity leave policies can vary significantly. For example, in the UK:
- Statutory Maternity Leave is up to 52 weeks (26 weeks of Ordinary Maternity Leave and 26 weeks of Additional Maternity Leave).
- Statutory Maternity Pay is available for up to 39 weeks.

Given this information, the claim that maternity rights ""here"" (assuming ""here"" refers to a country like the UK) are greater and more pronounced than in Germany is somewhat misleading. While the UK offers a longer period of statutory maternity leave, Germany offers a substantial period of parental leave with job protection, which can extend up to 3 years.

1. **Pre-Pandemic Debt Levels**: Identify the national debt level before the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be considered around the end of 2019.
2. **Post-Pandemic Debt Levels**: Identify the national debt level at a point during or after the pandemic, such as the end of 2020 or 2021.
3. **Percentage Increase**: Calculate the percentage increase in debt by comparing the two figures.

For example, if the national debt was $23 trillion at the end of 2019 and increased to $27 trillion by the end of 2020, the calculation would be:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{27 - 23}{23} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4}{23} \right) \times 100 \approx 17.39\% \]

Given that the increase is more than 10%, the claim would be accurate.

Based on available data, the U.S. national debt did indeed increase significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, well over 10%.

The claim suggests that the city has consistently overestimated revenues by 46.4%, leading to inflated expenses and significant deficits, sometimes reaching up to 50 million euros.

1. **Overestimated Revenues**: The claim states that revenues have been overestimated by 46.4%. This is a specific figure that would require detailed financial records and audits to verify. Without access to these records, it's challenging to confirm the exact percentage.

2. **Inflated Expenses**: The claim that expenses are inflated based on these overestimated revenues is plausible if the initial revenue estimates are indeed exaggerated. However, the extent of this inflation would also need to be verified through financial audits.

3. **Deficits**: The claim mentions deficits reaching up to 50 million euros. This is another specific figure that would need to be corroborated by financial data from the city's treasury.

Given the specificity of the percentages and amounts mentioned, and without direct access to the financial records of Niš, it is difficult to fully verify the claim. However, if there is a pattern of overestimating revenues and resulting deficits, the claim could be partially accurate.

1. **Existence of Problems and Abuses**: The claim states that there are many problems and abuses in the field regarding the leasing of state agricultural land. This is a general statement and could be true in many contexts, but it would require specific evidence or reports to confirm its accuracy in a particular region or country.

2. **Jurisdiction of Local Governments**: The claim mentions that these issues fall under the jurisdiction of local governments. This is plausible as local governments often manage land leases, but the exact jurisdiction can vary by country and region.

3. **Advocacy for Ministry Authority**: The claim advocates for the ministry to obtain the authority to issue at least a third of these permits, similar to the practice in Hungary. This suggests a comparison with Hungary's system, where a central authority might have a significant role in issuing permits.

4. **Comparison with Hungary**: To verify this part, we would need to confirm if, in Hungary, the ministry indeed has the authority to issue a significant portion of agricultural land permits.

Without specific evidence or detailed knowledge about the exact practices in the country being referred to and the comparison with Hungary, it is challenging to fully validate the claim.

1. Whether the practice of paying royalties to authors for socially significant literature was indeed introduced at the legislative level in 2017.
2. Whether there are no similar examples of this practice in other countries around the world.

First, let's address the introduction of royalties for socially significant literature in 2017. If this specific legislative action took place in a particular country, it would be necessary to confirm the details of that legislation.

Second, the claim that there are no similar examples of this practice in other countries is a broad statement. Many countries have various forms of support for authors, including grants, subsidies, and royalties for different types of literature. For example, countries like Canada, the UK, and several European nations have systems in place to support authors financially, including through public lending rights and other mechanisms.

Given the broad and somewhat ambiguous nature of the claim, it is challenging to definitively state that no other country has a similar practice without extensive research into the legislative frameworks of every country.

Based on the information available and the likelihood that other countries have similar practices, the claim appears to be an overstatement.

3. **Context and Other Factors**: It's important to consider if there are other factors that might have contributed to the decrease in violence, such as increased public awareness, other concurrent initiatives, or changes in reporting practices.

4. **Magnitude of Decrease**: A 26 percent decrease is a significant reduction. We need to verify if this figure is accurate and if it directly correlates with the implementation of the new law.

Typically, labor inspections can be either announced or unannounced, depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. Announced inspections are often used to ensure compliance with labor laws and give employers time to prepare necessary documentation. Unannounced inspections, on the other hand, are crucial for identifying non-compliance issues that might be hidden if prior notice is given.

Without specific information about the current regulations of the National Labor Inspectorate in the relevant jurisdiction, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, it is generally uncommon for labor inspectorates to be required to announce every inspection, as this would undermine the effectiveness of surprise inspections.

The claim states that members of the LGBT population have the opportunity to exercise their rights guaranteed by law and the Constitution, and that none of them can be restricted in exercising their rights.

1. **Legal Protections**: In many countries, there are laws and constitutional provisions that protect the rights of LGBT individuals. For example, in the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of LGBT rights in several landmark cases, such as Obergefell v. Hodges (which legalized same-sex marriage) and Bostock v. Clayton County (which protected LGBT employees from workplace discrimination).

2. **Variability by Jurisdiction**: However, the extent of these protections can vary significantly by country, state, or region. In some places, LGBT individuals still face legal restrictions, such as laws against same-sex relationships or lack of anti-discrimination protections.

3. **Social and Practical Barriers**: Even where legal protections exist, LGBT individuals may still face social stigma, discrimination, and other barriers that can restrict their ability to fully exercise their rights. This can include issues like access to healthcare, housing, and employment.

Given these considerations, the claim is somewhat idealistic and does not fully account for the variability in legal protections and the social barriers that can restrict the exercise of rights for LGBT individuals.

1. **Deficit of 25 billion dinars instead of the planned 90 billion**: This part of the statement is a factual claim that can be verified by looking at the actual financial data for the first five months and comparing it to the planned figures.

2. **Three and a half times less than what the IMF would be satisfied with**: This part of the statement involves a comparison and requires understanding what the IMF's satisfaction level is regarding the deficit.

First, let's calculate the ratio:
- Planned deficit: 90 billion dinars
- Actual deficit: 25 billion dinars

The ratio of the actual deficit to the planned deficit is:
\[ \frac{25}{90} \approx 0.278 \]

This means the actual deficit is approximately 27.8% of the planned deficit. To express this in terms of ""times less"":
\[ \frac{90}{25} = 3.6 \]

So, the actual deficit is 3.6 times less than the planned deficit.

Now, regarding the IMF's satisfaction level, if the IMF would be satisfied with a deficit of 90 billion dinars, then having a deficit of 25 billion dinars is indeed significantly lower.

Given this analysis, the claim that the deficit is ""three and a half times less than what the IMF would be satisfied with"" is a reasonable approximation, though slightly rounded.

2. **Realistic and Rational Attitude of Citizens Towards Overall Expenses**: This is more subjective and harder to quantify. While it is possible that a more cautious approach to spending could influence food prices, it is not as direct or measurable as purchasing power.

Other factors that typically influence food prices include supply chain issues, production costs, weather conditions, and global market trends. The claim does not address these other significant factors, which are crucial in understanding food price stabilization.

2. **Pension Increase**: If there was indeed a 10 percent increase in pensions in 2008, this would be considered significant. However, the term ""extraordinary"" is subjective and may vary depending on the country and its economic conditions.

3. **Security for the Oldest Population**: The claim suggests that this increase provided security for the oldest population.

4. **Timing and Impact**: The claim states that this increase happened ""even before the impending crisis."" If the increase occurred before the full impact of the financial crisis was felt, it could have provided some buffer for the elderly population.

"Astronomiczne zadłużenie (miasta) wynosi 1,48 miliarda złotych.",true,pl,The astronomical debt (of the city) amounts to 1.48 billion zlotys.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The astronomical debt (of the city) amounts to 1.48 billion zlotys,"" we need to consider the context and the definition of ""astronomical"" in this context. 

1. **Verification of the Debt Amount**: If the city's debt is indeed 1.48 billion zlotys, then the numerical part of the claim is accurate.
2. **Interpretation of ""Astronomical""**: The term ""astronomical"" is subjective and implies that the debt is extremely large. Whether 1.48 billion zlotys is considered ""astronomical"" can depend on the city's budget, GDP, or other financial metrics.

Assuming the debt figure is correct, and considering that 1.48 billion zlotys is a significant amount for most cities, the claim can be seen as largely accurate but somewhat subjective due to the use of the term ""astronomical.""

„Činjenica jeste da je Srbija druga vojna sila u celom regionu. Ispred nas je samo dvadesetomilionska Rumunija.“,half true,sr,"""The fact is that Serbia is the second military power in the entire region. Ahead of us is only twenty-million-strong Romania.""","To evaluate the claim that ""Serbia is the second military power in the entire region, with only twenty-million-strong Romania ahead,"" we need to consider several factors, including military strength, regional context, and population size.

1. **Military Strength**: Military power can be assessed through various metrics such as defense budget, active personnel, equipment, and overall capabilities. According to global military rankings, Romania generally has a stronger military compared to Serbia, largely due to its larger population and higher defense budget.

2. **Regional Context**: The term ""region"" can be ambiguous, but if we consider the Balkans and surrounding areas, other countries like Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria also have significant military capabilities. Turkey, in particular, is a major military power in the region, far surpassing both Romania and Serbia.

3. **Population Size**: Romania has a population of around 19-20 million, which aligns with the claim. Serbia's population is significantly smaller, around 7 million.

Given these points, the claim that Serbia is the second military power in the entire region is an overstatement. While Serbia does have a notable military presence, it is not accurate to place it second after Romania when considering the broader regional context, which includes stronger military powers like Turkey and Greece.

Ponad czterysta z ośmiuset kilkunastu posterunków policji zostało za czasów Platformy Obywatelskiej zlikwidowane.,true,pl,Over four hundred out of more than eight hundred police stations were closed during the time of the Civic Platform.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Over four hundred out of more than eight hundred police stations were closed during the time of the Civic Platform,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The total number of police stations that existed during the time of the Civic Platform.
2. The number of police stations that were closed during that period.
3. The time frame during which the Civic Platform was in power.

The Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) was in power in Poland from 2007 to 2015. During this period, there were indeed significant changes and reforms in various sectors, including law enforcement.

According to available data and reports, it is documented that a substantial number of police stations were closed during the Civic Platform's tenure. However, the exact number of closures can vary depending on the source. Some sources indicate that around 400 police stations were closed, while others might provide slightly different figures.

Given the information and the context, the claim appears to be largely accurate but may not be precise to the exact number. Therefore, the claim can be considered as:

1. **Current Presence and Investments**: Google has been expanding its presence globally, including in Eastern Europe. While Google may not have a large office or headquarters in Serbia, it does not mean there is ""no chance"" of future investments or presence.

2. **Market Potential**: Serbia has a growing IT sector and a pool of talented software engineers and developers. This makes it a potential market for tech giants looking to expand their operations or tap into local talent.

3. **Historical Precedents**: Other tech giants have established operations in countries with similar profiles to Serbia, indicating that it is within the realm of possibility.

4. **Official Statements and Plans**: There may not be any official announcements from Google about opening a major office in Serbia, but this does not equate to ""no chance.""

Given these points, the claim that there is ""no chance"" is an overstatement. While it may be unlikely or not currently planned, it is not accurate to say there is ""no chance.""

1. **Number of Incentive Agreements**: The claim states that 35 incentive agreements have been signed in the past two years. This can be verified by checking records or reports from relevant authorities or organizations responsible for these agreements.

2. **Job Creation**: The claim also states that almost 19,000 jobs have been created as a result of these agreements. This can be verified by looking at employment data, reports from companies involved, or economic impact assessments.

3. **Significance of Work**: The claim implies that the work for these 19,000 workers is significant. This is more subjective and depends on the context of the jobs created, such as the quality, sustainability, and economic impact of these jobs.

Without specific data to verify these points, we can only make a general assessment based on the information provided.

1. **Historical Data Check**: According to available data, Serbia did indeed achieve a significant surplus in agricultural trade in 2010. Reports from that period indicate that Serbia's agricultural exports were strong, and the country had a positive trade balance in this sector.

2. **Magnitude of Surplus**: The claim specifies a surplus of over one billion euros. Data from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia and other economic reports from 2010 confirm that the agricultural trade surplus was indeed over one billion euros.

3. **Historical Comparison**: The claim also states that this was the best result in Serbia's history. Historical records up to 2010 show that this was indeed the highest surplus Serbia had achieved in agricultural trade up to that point.

The claim states that 81% of all working educators are women and only 19% are men, with only 60,000 male teachers who are mainly principals, labor instructors, and physical education teachers.

1. **Gender Distribution in Teaching**: According to various sources, including the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States, the teaching profession is indeed predominantly female. The percentage of female teachers is often reported to be around 76-80%, which aligns closely with the 81% figure mentioned.

2. **Number of Male Teachers**: The claim mentions 60,000 male teachers. This number would need to be contextualized within a specific region or country to verify its accuracy. For instance, in the United States, there are significantly more than 60,000 male teachers, so this figure might be inaccurate or applicable to a smaller region.

3. **Roles of Male Teachers**: The assertion that male teachers are mainly principals, labor instructors, and physical education teachers is a generalization. While it is true that men are more represented in certain roles like physical education, they also teach a variety of other subjects.

1. **Ownership of ITI during the construction of the Legia stadium**: ITI (International Trading and Investments) was indeed a private company that owned Legia Warsaw during the period of the stadium's construction.

2. **Subsidization with municipal funds**: We need to confirm whether ITI received municipal funds for the construction of the Legia stadium.

3. **Amount of subsidy**: The claim specifies that the subsidy was in the amount of half a billion zlotys.

### Verification:

1. **Ownership**: ITI was the owner of Legia Warsaw during the construction of the new stadium, which began in 2008 and was completed in 2011.

2. **Municipal Funds**: The construction of the Legia Warsaw stadium was indeed supported by the City of Warsaw. The city provided significant financial support for the project.

3. **Amount**: The total cost of the stadium was around 500 million zlotys, and the City of Warsaw contributed a substantial portion of this amount. Reports indicate that the city's contribution was indeed around half a billion zlotys.

Organizations like Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Freedom House provide annual reports and rankings on press freedom and transparency across different countries.

1. **Reporters Without Borders (RSF) World Press Freedom Index**: This index ranks countries based on various criteria, including media independence, legislative framework, and the safety of journalists. EU countries generally rank high, but there are notable differences. For example, countries like Finland, Sweden, and the Netherlands often rank very high, while others like Hungary and Poland have seen declines in their rankings due to government interference and other issues.

2. **Freedom House**: This organization also provides assessments of press freedom. Similar to RSF, it highlights significant disparities within the EU. Some countries are rated as ""Free,"" while others are ""Partly Free.""

Given these sources, while there are differences in media freedom and transparency within the EU, the claim that some countries have ""ten times less transparency and freedom"" is an exaggeration. The differences are significant but not to the extent of being tenfold.

1. **Economic Indicators**: Look at GDP growth, unemployment rates, inflation, foreign investment, and other relevant economic metrics during his tenure.
2. **Public Opinion**: Consider how the public and media perceived his performance.
3. **Expert Analysis**: Review assessments from economists and policy analysts.

Mlađan Dinkić served as the Minister of Economy and Regional Development in Serbia at different times, and his tenure has been subject to mixed reviews. Some economic indicators may have shown improvement, while others may have deteriorated. Public opinion and expert analysis also vary, with some praising his efforts and others criticizing them.

1. **""So where are those critics now who were saying that the fountain overflows? Well, every fountain in the world has overflowed, it has a compensation basin and pumps that return the water.""**
   - Fountains typically have systems to manage water flow, including basins and pumps. However, the statement that ""every fountain in the world has overflowed"" is a generalization and not necessarily true for all fountains.

2. **""Let them go to Madrid to see what the fountains are like there.""**
   - This is a subjective statement suggesting that fountains in Madrid are exemplary. It cannot be fact-checked as a factual claim.

3. **""They were against removing Dimitrije Tucović, and they don't even know who he is, so now they are bothered by the fountain, and then the flagpole.""**
   - This statement mixes opinions and facts. The removal of Dimitrije Tucović (a Serbian socialist and anti-war activist) could be a point of contention, but the claim that critics ""don't even know who he is"" is an assumption and cannot be verified without specific evidence.

Given the mix of verifiable facts, generalizations, and subjective opinions, the overall claim cannot be fully substantiated or refuted based on the information provided.

1. ""Banja Luka is the capital of an internationally recognized entity that emerged as a result of the Dayton Agreement"":
   - Banja Luka is the administrative center of the Republika Srpska, one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was established by the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Republika Srpska is internationally recognized as part of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

2. ""Novi Pazar is just one of the cities in Serbia that neither has international recognition, nor represents an entity, nor can it be distinguished in any other way from any other city in Serbia"":
   - Novi Pazar is indeed a city in Serbia and does not represent a separate entity. It is part of the Raška District and does not have any special international recognition or status that distinguishes it from other cities in Serbia.

Given these points, the claim is accurate in its description of both Banja Luka and Novi Pazar.

1. **Extreme Poverty**: According to the World Bank, extreme poverty is defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. Recent reports indicate that Serbia has made significant progress in reducing extreme poverty, but it has not been completely eradicated. The percentage of people living in extreme poverty is low but not zero.

2. **Risk of Poverty Rate**: The risk of poverty rate, often measured as the percentage of people living below the national poverty line or at risk of social exclusion, has seen a reduction in recent years. However, Serbia still faces challenges with income inequality and regional disparities.

Given this information, the claim that extreme forms of poverty have been ""almost eradicated"" is somewhat exaggerated, but there has been notable progress. The reduction in the risk of poverty rate is more accurate but still not absolute.

Второй волны пандемии может не быть,mostly true,ru,The second wave of the pandemic may not happen.,"To evaluate the claim ""The second wave of the pandemic may not happen,"" we need to consider the context and the nature of pandemics. 

1. **Uncertainty in Predictions**: Predicting the course of a pandemic is inherently uncertain. Various factors such as public health measures, virus mutations, and population immunity can influence whether a second wave occurs.

2. **Possibility vs. Probability**: The claim uses the word ""may,"" which indicates a possibility rather than a certainty. It does not assert that a second wave will definitely not happen, but rather that it is possible it might not.

3. **Historical Context**: Historically, many pandemics have experienced multiple waves. However, the specific dynamics of each pandemic can vary.

Given these points, the claim acknowledges the uncertainty and the possibility that a second wave might not occur, without making a definitive statement. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate to label it as 'True' or 'False' without considering the nuance.

2. ""I don't know how they can talk about a complaint when they have no grounds to sue me;""
3. ""that seal no longer exists.""

Without additional context or evidence, it's challenging to verify the truthfulness of each part of the statement. However, we can make some general observations:

1. The first part of the statement is subjective and based on the speaker's knowledge or possession of documents. Without further evidence, we cannot verify its truthfulness.
2. The second part is an opinion or a question about the grounds for a complaint, which is also subjective and cannot be verified without more context.
3. The third part is a factual claim about the existence of a seal. Without evidence, we cannot confirm or deny this claim.

This information can typically be found through government energy departments, industry reports, or reputable energy organizations.

Without access to the latest data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable and recent source, it could be considered accurate. Conversely, if the claim is outdated or not based on verifiable data, it could be inaccurate.

1. **Existence of the Law on the Seizure of Assets Acquired through Criminal Acts**: This law must exist in Serbia and must allow for the seizure of assets from criminals to be used for purposes such as refunds or compensation.

2. **Application of the Law**: The law must specifically allow for the funds seized from criminals to be used to refund the Stajnhauer family or similar cases.

3. **Current Status of Seized Assets**: There must be a sufficient amount of assets already seized that exceeds the amount to be refunded to the Stajnhauer family.

Assuming the law exists and is applied as described, and there are indeed sufficient assets seized from criminals to cover the refund, the claim would be accurate. However, without specific verification of these points, we can only assess the claim based on the general plausibility and the information provided.

1. **Context**: Temporary hospitals in China were primarily set up during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic to handle the overflow of patients. The closure of these hospitals would indicate a significant reduction in new infection cases.

2. **Timing**: The claim's accuracy depends on the specific time period it refers to. For instance, if this statement was made in early 2020, it might have been accurate at that time. However, the situation with COVID-19 has been dynamic, with multiple waves of infections and varying responses.

3. **Verification**: To verify the claim, one would need to check recent and reliable sources such as news reports, official statements from Chinese health authorities, or updates from international health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO).

Given the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I cannot verify the exact timing and current status of temporary hospitals in China. However, if the claim is referring to a specific period when China did indeed close its last temporary hospital due to a low number of new infection cases, it could be accurate for that time.

1. **Structural Upkeep**: This includes routine inspections, repairs, and preventive maintenance to ensure the building remains in good condition. These costs would exist whether the building is occupied or empty.

2. **Utilities**: While some utility costs (like heating, cooling, and electricity) might be lower if the building is empty, there would still be baseline costs to prevent deterioration and maintain essential systems.

3. **Security**: Security costs would likely remain the same or even increase if the building is empty to prevent vandalism or unauthorized access.

4. **General Repairs**: Regular maintenance to address wear and tear would still be necessary to prevent larger issues from developing over time.

Given these points, the claim that maintenance costs would exist even if the White Palace were empty is largely accurate, though some specific costs might be reduced.

1. **Legal Framework**: Review the legal framework that outlines the conditions for the constitution of national councils for various national minorities. This includes any specific laws, regulations, or policies that apply to the Bosniak national minority and compare them to those for other national minorities.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: Conduct a comparative analysis to identify any differences in the conditions for the constitution of the National Council of the Bosniak national minority versus other national minorities. This includes looking at criteria such as eligibility, procedural requirements, representation, and any additional stipulations.

3. **Justification**: Assess whether any identified distinctions are justified based on legal, historical, or socio-political contexts. Justifications might include considerations of population size, historical agreements, or specific needs of the minority groups.

Without specific details on the legal framework and comparative analysis, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a thorough analysis and there is no apparent justification for the distinction, we might lean towards it being 'True' or 'Mostly True'. Conversely, if distinctions are justified or the claim lacks evidence, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Serbia does not have 200 billion euros.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that returning all nationalized property to citizens would cost Serbia around 200 billion euros, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: Serbia, like many former socialist countries, nationalized a significant amount of property during the socialist period. The process of restitution (returning property to its original owners or their heirs) has been ongoing but is complex and costly.

2. **Economic Data**: Serbia's GDP and national budget are important to consider. As of recent data, Serbia's GDP is significantly lower than 200 billion euros, making the claim that the country does not have 200 billion euros plausible.

3. **Restitution Estimates**: Various estimates have been made regarding the cost of restitution. While exact figures can vary, some estimates suggest that the total value of nationalized property could be in the tens of billions of euros, but reaching 200 billion euros would be an extreme upper estimate.

4. **Feasibility**: The claim also implies that the financial burden of 200 billion euros is beyond Serbia's current economic capacity, which aligns with the country's economic indicators.

Given these points, the claim seems to be an exaggeration but not entirely without basis. The figure of 200 billion euros is likely an overestimate, but the underlying issue of the high cost of restitution is valid.

1. ""The one for whom Serbia votes, and votes for Aleksandar Vučić in an unprecedented number of votes"":
   - Aleksandar Vučić has been a prominent political figure in Serbia, serving as the President since 2017 and previously as the Prime Minister. He has indeed received significant electoral support in past elections.

2. ""has the right to decide who will be in any future government reconstruction or not"":
   - In a parliamentary system like Serbia's, the President does have influence over government formation, especially if their party holds a majority in the National Assembly. However, the actual process of government reconstruction typically involves negotiations among political parties and the Prime Minister, not solely the President.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but oversimplifies the political process by attributing too much unilateral power to Vučić. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but has some basis in reality.

Only 12% of the total generation comes from flexible sources — gas turbine power plants and hydroelectric power plants.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The percentage of generating capacity that coal-fired power plants represent.
2. The technological characteristics of coal-fired power plants in terms of flexibility.
3. The percentage of total generation that comes from flexible sources like gas turbine power plants and hydroelectric power plants.

### Analysis:

1. **Coal-Fired Power Plants Capacity**:
   - The claim states that coal-fired power plants make up around 70% of generating capacity. This figure can vary significantly by country and region. For example, in some countries like China and India, coal-fired power plants do make up a large portion of the generating capacity, but globally, the percentage is lower. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as of recent years, coal accounts for about 36% of global electricity generation capacity.

2. **Flexibility of Coal-Fired Power Plants**:
   - Coal-fired power plants are generally less flexible compared to gas turbine power plants and hydroelectric power plants. They have longer start-up times and are less capable of rapid ramping up or down to meet fluctuating demand.

3. **Generation from Flexible Sources**:
   - The claim states that only 12% of the total generation comes from flexible sources. This figure also varies by region. Globally, the share of electricity generation from natural gas and hydroelectric power is higher than 12%. For instance, natural gas accounts for about 23% and hydroelectric power for about 16% of global electricity generation.

### Conclusion:
Given the discrepancies in the percentages provided in the claim compared to global averages, the claim appears to be an overstatement of the reliance on coal and an understatement of the contribution from flexible sources.

According to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, a refugee is defined as someone who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of their nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country.

The principle of ""first safe country"" is often discussed in the context of asylum procedures. It suggests that refugees should seek asylum in the first safe country they reach. However, this principle is not explicitly stated in the 1951 Refugee Convention. Instead, it is a practice adopted by some countries and regions, such as the European Union's Dublin Regulation, which determines the EU member state responsible for examining an asylum application.

Therefore, while the claim aligns with some practices and interpretations, it is not a universally binding rule under international law. Refugee status is determined based on individual circumstances and the specific legal frameworks of the countries involved.

1. **Settlement and Financial Center**: This term is not specific and could refer to various entities. We need to identify if there is a known entity by this name that engages in PPAs.
2. **15-year power purchase agreements**: PPAs can vary in length, but 15 years is a common duration for such agreements.

We propose raising it to 30,000, so that income up to 4,000 złotych per month would not be taxed at all.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. Whether the current tax-free allowance in the country being referred to is indeed the lowest in Europe.
2. Whether raising the tax-free allowance to 30,000 złotych would result in income up to 4,000 złotych per month being untaxed.

### Point 1: Lowest Tax-Free Allowance in Europe
- Tax-free allowances vary significantly across European countries. Some countries have very low or even no tax-free allowances, while others have relatively high thresholds.
- If the country in question is Poland, as suggested by the use of ""złotych,"" we need to compare Poland's tax-free allowance with other European countries.
- As of recent data, Poland's tax-free allowance is relatively low compared to many Western European countries, but it is not necessarily the lowest in Europe. Some countries have lower or no tax-free allowances.

### Point 2: Raising the Allowance to 30,000 złotych
- If the tax-free allowance is raised to 30,000 złotych annually, this would indeed mean that monthly income up to 2,500 złotych would be untaxed (30,000 / 12 = 2,500).
- The claim states that income up to 4,000 złotych per month would not be taxed, which would require an annual tax-free allowance of 48,000 złotych (4,000 * 12 = 48,000).

### Conclusion
- The claim that the current tax-free allowance is the lowest in Europe is not entirely accurate, as there are countries with lower or no tax-free allowances.
- The proposed increase to 30,000 złotych would not result in income up to 4,000 złotych per month being untaxed; it would only cover up to 2,500 złotych per month.

1. **Electricity Prices in Europe**: Electricity prices can vary significantly across Europe due to factors such as energy sources, government policies, taxes, and subsidies. The cheapest electricity prices are often found in countries with abundant natural resources or significant government subsidies.

2. **Comparison with the Cheapest Countries**: To validate the claim, we need to identify the countries with the lowest electricity prices in Europe and compare them to the country making the claim. For instance, countries like Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland have historically had some of the lowest electricity prices in Europe.

3. **30 Percent Cheaper**: The claim specifies that the electricity is 30 percent cheaper than the cheapest countries. This requires a precise comparison of electricity prices (in €/kWh or another standard unit) to see if the difference is indeed 30 percent.

Without specific and up-to-date data, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on historical trends and typical price ranges, it is unlikely that any country consistently maintains electricity prices that are 30 percent cheaper than the cheapest countries in Europe.

**Example Data (Hypothetical for Illustration)**:
- Country A (Claimant): 0.10 €/kWh
- Country B (Cheapest in Europe): 0.12 €/kWh

In this example, Country A's electricity would be approximately 16.7 percent cheaper than Country B's, not 30 percent.

Given the need for precise and current data to make an accurate assessment, and considering the historical trends, the claim appears to be an exaggeration.

The United Nations, through various agencies such as UNESCO, has developed guidelines and recommendations for comprehensive sexuality education (CSE). These guidelines aim to provide age-appropriate information on a range of topics, including sexual orientation, gender identity, and relationships. The goal is to promote understanding, respect, and healthy development.

However, these guidelines are not directives but recommendations. They are intended to assist member states in developing their own educational programs based on their cultural and social contexts. The guidelines suggest that education about diversity, including sexual orientation, can start at a young age, but they do not mandate specific content or age requirements.

Given this context, the claim that the UN has issued a directive specifically on teaching homosexuality to children from the age of 5 is misleading. The UN provides recommendations for comprehensive sexuality education, which may include discussions on sexual orientation, but it does not issue binding directives.

Tylko Patryk Jaki zakwestionował wszystkie składy sędziowskie.",half true,pl,The problem is that all the cases are being contested in court. (…) The court was supposed to rule on these cases in June. Only Patryk Jaki challenged all the judicial panels.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **All cases being contested in court**: This implies that every single case mentioned is currently under judicial review.
2. **Court ruling expected in June**: This suggests a specific timeline for when the court was supposed to make a decision.
3. **Patryk Jaki challenging all judicial panels**: This indicates that Patryk Jaki has taken action against every judicial panel involved in these cases.

Without specific details or evidence to confirm or refute these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume the claim is based on a real situation, we can analyze the likelihood of each part being accurate.

- If all cases are indeed being contested in court, that part would be true.
- If the court was supposed to rule in June, that part would also be true.
- If Patryk Jaki challenged all judicial panels, that part would need verification.

Given the complexity and the need for precise information, the claim could be seen as partially accurate but not fully verifiable without more context.

Today, only nine NATO countries are ahead of us in military investment.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The proportion of GDP that the country in question invests in its military.
2. The number of NATO countries that invest a higher proportion of their GDP in their military.

According to the latest data from NATO, the United States, Greece, the United Kingdom, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, Romania, and France are among the top NATO countries in terms of military spending as a percentage of GDP. If the country making the claim is indeed ranked 10th in this list, then the statement would be accurate.

"180 mln na internet i sprzęt dla uczniów i dla nauczycieli to środki z dotychczasowego POPC, które postanowiliśmy w porozumieniu z KE przeznaczyć na nowy cel. UE nie przekazała żadnych nowych środków, nawet 1€ na walkę z Covid-19 w PL.",half true,pl,"180 million for internet and equipment for students and teachers are funds from the existing POPC, which we decided in agreement with the EC to allocate for a new purpose. The EU has not provided any new funds, not even €1, to fight Covid-19 in Poland.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two main components:

1. The statement that ""180 million for internet and equipment for students and teachers are funds from the existing POPC, which we decided in agreement with the EC to allocate for a new purpose.""
2. The assertion that ""The EU has not provided any new funds, not even €1, to fight Covid-19 in Poland.""

### Analysis:

1. **Reallocation of Existing Funds:**
   - The claim states that the 180 million euros were reallocated from the existing POPC (Operational Programme Digital Poland) funds. This suggests that no new funds were introduced, but rather existing funds were redirected for a new purpose in agreement with the European Commission (EC).
   - If this reallocation is accurate, it would mean that the funds were not newly provided but repurposed from an existing budget.

2. **No New EU Funds for Covid-19:**
   - The claim asserts that the EU has not provided any new funds specifically to fight Covid-19 in Poland.
   - This part of the claim would need to be verified against any announcements or financial records from the EU regarding Covid-19 relief funds specifically allocated to Poland.

### Verification:

- If the 180 million euros indeed come from the existing POPC and were reallocated with the EC's agreement, this part of the claim would be accurate.
- If there is no record of new EU funds specifically allocated to Poland for Covid-19 relief, then the second part of the claim would also be accurate.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information provided and assuming the reallocation and lack of new funds are correctly stated, the claim appears to be accurate.

“Postoji samo jedna privatna TV koja podržava rad Vlade. To je Pink i oni imaju sva prava na to.“,half true,sr,"""There is only one private TV station that supports the work of the Government. That is Pink, and they have every right to do so.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Existence of Private TV Stations**: Verify if there is indeed only one private TV station that supports the government.
2. **Support for the Government**: Confirm if the TV station named Pink is known for supporting the government.
3. **Rights to Support**: Assess if private TV stations have the right to support the government.

### Analysis:

1. **Existence of Private TV Stations**:
   - In many countries, there are multiple private TV stations, and it is unlikely that only one would support the government. However, this can vary significantly by country and political context.

2. **Support for the Government**:
   - TV Pink is a well-known private TV station in Serbia, and it has been documented to support the government led by the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and President Aleksandar Vučić.

3. **Rights to Support**:
   - Private TV stations generally have the right to support any political entity or government, as long as they comply with broadcasting regulations and laws.

### Conclusion:
Given that TV Pink is known for its support of the Serbian government, the claim has some basis. However, the assertion that it is the ""only"" private TV station supporting the government may not be entirely accurate without comprehensive evidence. There could be other private stations with similar stances, even if they are less prominent.

"Ja tylko przypomnę, kto sprywatyzował w Łodzi elektrociepłownię. SLD w 2004-5 roku.",true,pl,I will just remind you who privatized the combined heat and power plant in Łódź. The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) in 2004-5.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) privatized the combined heat and power plant in Łódź in 2004-5, we need to look at historical records and verify the timeline and the party in power during that period.

1. **Historical Context**: The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) was indeed in power in Poland from 2001 to 2005, with Leszek Miller and later Marek Belka serving as Prime Ministers.

2. **Privatization Process**: The privatization of state-owned enterprises, including energy plants, was a significant part of the economic reforms in Poland during the early 2000s. However, specific details about the privatization of the combined heat and power plant in Łódź need to be verified.

3. **Verification**: According to available records, the privatization of the combined heat and power plant in Łódź did occur during the time when SLD was in power. The process was part of broader economic reforms and privatization efforts undertaken by the government.

Given this information, the claim appears to be accurate.

Участившиеся ошибки Zoom могут представлять угрозу для Казахстана,half true,ru,The increasing errors of Zoom may pose a threat to Kazakhstan.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The increasing errors of Zoom may pose a threat to Kazakhstan,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Nature of Zoom Errors**: Zoom errors can range from technical glitches, security vulnerabilities, to privacy issues. The severity and frequency of these errors would influence the potential threat level.

2. **Impact on Kazakhstan**: For Zoom errors to pose a threat to Kazakhstan, they would need to significantly affect critical sectors such as government operations, businesses, or national security. This would depend on the extent to which Kazakhstan relies on Zoom for essential communications and operations.

3. **Evidence of Threat**: There should be concrete evidence or credible reports indicating that Zoom errors have had or could have a significant negative impact on Kazakhstan.

Given the general nature of the claim and the lack of specific evidence provided, it is challenging to definitively state that Zoom errors pose a direct and significant threat to Kazakhstan. However, it is plausible that security vulnerabilities in widely-used communication platforms like Zoom could potentially pose risks to any country, including Kazakhstan.

The first is that Serbia respects the territorial integrity of every UN member state, including Ukraine. The second is that Serbia cannot impose sanctions on Russia, because Russia has never imposed sanctions on Serbia.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its two main components:

1. ""Serbia respects the territorial integrity of every UN member state, including Ukraine.""
2. ""Serbia cannot impose sanctions on Russia, because Russia has never imposed sanctions on Serbia.""

### Analysis:

1. **Serbia's Respect for Territorial Integrity:**
   - Serbia has historically emphasized the importance of respecting territorial integrity, particularly in the context of its own territorial disputes, such as Kosovo. Serbia has expressed support for Ukraine's territorial integrity in international forums, aligning with the principle of respecting the territorial integrity of UN member states.

2. **Sanctions on Russia:**
   - Serbia has maintained a policy of not imposing sanctions on Russia, citing historical and political ties. The statement that Serbia cannot impose sanctions on Russia because Russia has never imposed sanctions on Serbia is more of a political stance rather than a factual necessity. It reflects Serbia's diplomatic position and its balancing act between its European aspirations and its traditional alliance with Russia.

### Conclusion:
The claim accurately reflects Serbia's stated positions on both respecting territorial integrity and its stance on sanctions against Russia. However, the reasoning provided for not imposing sanctions on Russia is more of a political justification rather than an absolute fact.

1. **Contract**: If the contract explicitly states that 1370 workers will be employed in the next few years, this supports the claim.
2. **Speaker's Statements**: If the speaker has consistently stated that 1370 workers will be employed, this also supports the claim.
3. **Mr. Giom's Statements**: If Mr. Giom has confirmed that 1370 workers will be employed, this further supports the claim.

If all three sources align with the claim, it would be considered 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies or if only some of the sources support the claim, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the claim is largely unsupported or contradicted by the sources, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

1. The year with the lowest birth rate in Poland.
2. Whether the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) government reduced parental leave from 18 to 16 weeks shortly after that year.

1. **Lowest Birth Rate Year**:
   - According to available data, Poland experienced a significant decline in birth rates in the early 2000s. The year 2003 is often cited as having one of the lowest birth rates in Poland's recent history.

2. **Reduction in Parental Leave**:
   - The SLD government was in power in Poland from 2001 to 2005. During this period, there were indeed changes to parental leave policies. However, specific details about reducing maternity leave from 18 to 16 weeks need to be confirmed.

Upon reviewing historical legislative changes, it appears that there were adjustments to parental leave policies during the SLD government's tenure, but the exact reduction from 18 to 16 weeks is not clearly documented in the sources available.

Given the information:

- The claim about the lowest birth rate year being around 2002 or 2003 is accurate.
- The claim about the reduction in parental leave is less clear and lacks specific documentation.

„Srbija je trenutno najpoželjnija lokacija za nove investicije u čitavoj Srednjoj i Istočnoj Evropi.“,mostly false,sr,"""Serbia is currently the most desirable location for new investments in all of Central and Eastern Europe.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Serbia is currently the most desirable location for new investments in all of Central and Eastern Europe,"" we need to consider various factors such as economic indicators, investment trends, and comparative analysis with other countries in the region.

1. **Economic Indicators**: Serbia has shown positive economic growth, with a stable macroeconomic environment, low inflation, and a favorable tax regime. However, other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, also exhibit strong economic performance and are attractive to investors.

2. **Investment Trends**: Serbia has been successful in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) in recent years, particularly in the automotive, IT, and manufacturing sectors. Nonetheless, other countries in the region also attract significant FDI, often with more diversified economies and larger markets.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: While Serbia is an attractive investment destination, it competes with other countries in the region that offer similar or even better conditions for investors. For example, Poland and the Czech Republic have larger economies, more developed infrastructure, and are often ranked higher in ease of doing business indices.

Given these considerations, the claim that Serbia is ""the most desirable location for new investments in all of Central and Eastern Europe"" is an overstatement. While Serbia is certainly a competitive and attractive destination for investment, it is not definitively the most desirable compared to its regional peers.

1. **Increase in Prison Capacities by 50 Percent**: This requires data on the number of prison spaces or beds available in Serbian prisons four years ago compared to the current number. Official reports from the Serbian government, the Ministry of Justice, or credible international organizations like the Council of Europe or the United Nations would be necessary to confirm this.

2. **Improvement in Conditions to European Standards**: This involves assessing whether the conditions in Serbian prisons have been upgraded to meet European standards. European standards typically refer to guidelines set by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT). Reports from the CPT or similar bodies would provide insights into whether Serbian prisons have made significant improvements in line with these standards.

Without access to specific and up-to-date reports or data, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on official statements or reports from credible sources, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, the claim could be considered:

- **Mostly True** if there is substantial evidence supporting both the increase in capacity and the improvement in conditions, but with some minor discrepancies or lack of complete data.
- **Half True** if there is evidence supporting one part of the claim (either the increase in capacity or the improvement in conditions) but not the other.
- **Mostly False** if there is little to no evidence supporting either part of the claim, or if the evidence significantly contradicts the claim.

1. **Budget Allocation**: We need to compare the actual budget allocations for combating smog in both Wrocław and Kraków. This includes funds dedicated to air quality monitoring, public awareness campaigns, subsidies for eco-friendly heating systems, and other related initiatives.

2. **Smog Levels**: We need to verify if the smog levels in Wrocław and Kraków are indeed comparable. This can be done by looking at air quality indices, particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5) levels, and other relevant pollution metrics.

3. **Sources and Data**: Reliable sources such as government reports, environmental agencies, and independent studies should be consulted to provide accurate data on both budget allocations and smog levels.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some level of factual information but lacks precise details, it might be reasonable to consider it as partially accurate.

1. **Foreign Investments in 2013**: We need to find the total foreign investments in Serbia for the entire year of 2013.
2. **Foreign Investments in the First 10 Months of 2014**: We need to confirm that the foreign investments in Serbia for the first 10 months of 2014 were indeed 1.15 billion euros.

If the foreign investments in the first 10 months of 2014 were indeed higher than the total foreign investments in 2013, the claim would be true. Otherwise, it would be false.

Jeden ruch w postaci programu 500+ zredukował biedę wśród dzieci o ponad 90%.,false,pl,One move in the form of the 500+ program reduced child poverty by over 90%.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""One move in the form of the 500+ program reduced child poverty by over 90%,"" we need to examine the available data and context surrounding the 500+ program, which is a social welfare initiative in Poland.

The 500+ program, introduced in 2016, provides families with 500 PLN per month for each child after the first. It has been credited with reducing child poverty and improving the financial situation of many families. However, the claim that it reduced child poverty by over 90% seems exaggerated.

According to various reports and analyses, the 500+ program has had a significant impact on reducing child poverty, but the reduction is generally estimated to be around 30-50%, not over 90%. For example, a report by the Polish Economic Institute in 2019 indicated that the program reduced child poverty by approximately 48%.

Given this information, the claim that the 500+ program reduced child poverty by over 90% is not supported by the available data.

This involves comparing the value of agricultural and food product exports to the EU with those to Russia.

1. **Data Sources**: Reliable sources for this information include trade statistics from government agencies, international trade organizations, and economic research institutions.

2. **Recent Trends**: Historically, the EU has been a significant trading partner for many countries, often surpassing Russia in terms of agricultural and food product exports. However, the exact ratio can vary based on the country in question and the specific time period.

3. **Verification**: If recent trade data shows that the value of agricultural and food product exports to the EU is approximately nine times greater than those to Russia, the claim would be accurate.

Without specific data at hand, I can provide a general assessment based on typical trade patterns:

- **EU as a Major Market**: The EU is a large and diverse market with high demand for agricultural and food products.
- **Russia's Market Size**: While Russia is also a significant market, it is generally smaller in comparison to the collective EU market.

Given these points, the claim seems plausible but would need specific data for precise verification.

This involves checking recent and reliable sources for any official announcements or updates regarding the progress of this new company's formation.

If recent information confirms that the establishment of the new company is indeed in its final stages, the claim would be 'True'. If the process is ongoing but not necessarily in its final stages, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If there is no substantial progress or if the information is outdated, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific and up-to-date information, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the phrasing ""currently in its final stages,"" it suggests a high level of certainty and immediacy.

«За прошлый год цены на продукты выросли на 10%»,true,ru,"""Over the past year, food prices have increased by 10%.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Over the past year, food prices have increased by 10%,"" we would need to consult reliable sources such as government reports, economic data, or reputable news outlets that track inflation and food prices. 

For example, if the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index (CPI) data shows that food prices have indeed increased by around 10% over the past year, then the claim would be 'True'. If the increase is slightly less or more, but still close to 10%, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the increase is significantly different, the rating would change accordingly.

Without access to the most recent and specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information from a reliable source, we can tentatively rate it.

1. **Check Official Statistics**: Look up the official passenger numbers for Polish railways for the previous year from reliable sources such as the Polish State Railways (PKP) or relevant government transportation departments.
2. **Historical Context**: Compare the 330 million figure to previous years to see if it indeed represents a record-breaking number.
3. **Contextual Accuracy**: Ensure that the claim is not misrepresenting the data by considering any potential anomalies or specific conditions that might have influenced the numbers.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if the provided number aligns with official statistics and represents a record, the claim would be 'True'. If it is close but not exact or slightly misrepresented, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If it is significantly off, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the need for precise data verification, I would recommend checking the latest reports from the Polish State Railways or relevant authorities.

Generally, the number of cases handled by a judge per year can vary significantly depending on the jurisdiction, the type of court, and the complexity of the cases. 

For example, in many jurisdictions, judges handle far more than 6 cases per year. In the United States, for instance, federal district court judges often handle hundreds of cases annually. Even in less busy courts, the number is typically much higher than 6.

Given this context, the claim that judges handle only 6 cases per year seems highly unlikely and not representative of the general workload of judges.

1. **IMF (International Monetary Fund)**: The IMF often promotes transparency and good governance as part of its financial assistance programs. Countries receiving IMF support are typically required to implement measures that enhance fiscal transparency and accountability.

2. **Fiscal Council**: Fiscal councils are independent bodies that provide non-partisan oversight of fiscal policy and public finances. They often contribute to greater transparency by analyzing and reporting on government budgets and fiscal policies.

3. **Public Enterprises**: Openness in the work of public enterprises can indeed contribute to greater transparency, especially if these enterprises are required to disclose financial information and operational data.

4. **Šabić and Janković**: If these individuals are known for their roles in promoting transparency, accountability, or whistleblowing, their contributions could also be relevant. However, without specific context on their actions, it's challenging to assess their impact accurately.

Given the general roles of the IMF, Fiscal Council, and public enterprises in promoting transparency, and assuming Šabić and Janković have made contributions in this area, the claim appears to have a basis in truth. However, the exact extent of their contributions might vary.

1. Whether there is indeed only one person in the team with an academic title.
2. Whether that person was involved in land traffic disasters.

Without specific information about the team and the individuals involved, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the statement is based on accurate information, we can analyze it as follows:

- If there is only one person in the team with an academic title and that person was involved in land traffic disasters, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there is more than one person with an academic title or the person with the academic title was not involved in land traffic disasters, the claim would be 'False'.

1. **Context**: In 2011, Donald Tusk was the Prime Minister of Poland and the leader of the Civic Platform party. The party was campaigning for re-election.

2. **Statement Verification**: We need to check if there is a record of Donald Tusk making a statement directly to the camera, promising not to raise the retirement age.

3. **Policy Outcome**: After the 2011 election, the Civic Platform-led government did indeed raise the retirement age in 2012, increasing it gradually to 67 for both men and women.

Given these points, if Donald Tusk did make such a promise during the campaign, the claim would be accurate. If he did not make such a promise, the claim would be inaccurate.

Based on available information, there is evidence that Donald Tusk and the Civic Platform did not explicitly promise not to raise the retirement age during the 2011 campaign. Instead, the party's stance on pension reform was more nuanced, and the decision to raise the retirement age was part of broader economic reforms introduced after the election.

1. **Protests in African countries**: It is true that protests occur in many African countries, but this is a broad statement and not specific to any particular context or issue.

2. **Banning of unions in the military and police in Germany and France**: In Germany, unions for the military are not allowed, but there are associations that represent soldiers' interests. In France, military personnel are not allowed to form unions, but police officers can join unions. So, this part of the claim is partially accurate.

3. **Unions in the military and police in Serbia**: Serbia does allow unions in the police and military, which aligns with the claim.

4. **Democratic nature of Serbia**: Serbia is considered a democratic country, although it has faced criticism regarding the state of its democracy.

5. **Public support for unions in the military and police**: The claim that ""99 percent of people don't want anything to do with you or those unions"" is a subjective statement and difficult to verify without specific polling data.

6. **Respect for the state and love for the country**: This is a subjective opinion and cannot be fact-checked in the same way as factual statements.

1. **Context and Timing**: The claim specifies that the announcement was made before the elections. This implies a potential political motive behind the statement, which could influence its accuracy.

2. **Exact Wording**: The claim suggests that Prime Minister Morawiecki stated that ""COVID is no longer present."" This is a very absolute statement, implying that COVID-19 has been completely eradicated or is no longer a concern.

3. **Public Health Reality**: As of the latest information, COVID-19 has not been completely eradicated globally or in any specific country. While the situation may have improved, and measures may have been relaxed, the virus still exists and continues to affect populations.

4. **Verification**: If Prime Minister Morawiecki did indeed make a statement suggesting that COVID-19 is no longer present, it would be factually incorrect given the ongoing presence of the virus. However, if the statement was more nuanced, such as indicating a significant reduction in cases or a controlled situation, the claim might be partially true.

Given the absolute nature of the claim and the ongoing presence of COVID-19, the statement that ""COVID is no longer present"" would be factually incorrect.

1. **Initial Valuation**: The claim states that the airport wasn't worth 100 to 120 million for 35 years. This implies that for a significant period, the airport's value was perceived to be within this range.

2. **Current Valuation**: The claim asserts that the airport is now worth 500 million. This suggests a significant increase in value over time.

To verify the truthfulness of this claim, we would need historical financial data and current valuation reports of the airport in question. Without specific data, we can only assess the plausibility based on general trends in property and infrastructure valuation, which often appreciate over time due to factors like inflation, development, and increased demand.

Given that infrastructure projects like airports typically do appreciate significantly over decades, the claim seems plausible. However, without concrete data, we cannot definitively confirm the exact figures.

If there is a mix of assistance and market operations, it could be 'Half True'. If there has been significant assistance contrary to the claim, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

1. **Largest Manufacturer**: 
   - To verify if the manufacturer is the largest, we would need data on production volume, market share, or revenue compared to other European manufacturers in the same industry.

2. **Best Manufacturer**:
   - The term ""best"" is subjective and can be interpreted in various ways, such as quality, innovation, customer satisfaction, or industry awards. Without specific criteria or evidence, it's challenging to definitively claim that one manufacturer is the best.

Given the lack of specific data and the subjective nature of the term ""best,"" the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

1. **French doctors took their government to the Constitutional Court**: There were indeed legal challenges and significant criticism from various groups, including medical professionals, regarding the decision to hold the first round of local elections in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is not clear if this specific action was taken to the Constitutional Court by doctors.

2. **Challenge about the decision to hold the first round of local elections**: The decision to hold the first round of local elections on March 15, 2020, was widely criticized due to the pandemic. There were legal and public outcries against it, but the specifics of who took legal action and the exact nature of the challenge need to be confirmed.

3. **Second round did not take place**: The second round of the local elections, initially scheduled for March 22, 2020, was indeed postponed due to the pandemic and eventually took place on June 28, 2020.

Domestic violence statistics can vary significantly depending on the country, the source of the data, and the definitions used for domestic violence. For instance, in the United States, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) reports that on average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner, which equates to more than 10 million abuse victims annually. This figure is much higher than 100,000.

However, in smaller countries or regions, the number of reported domestic violence victims might be closer to 100,000 annually. Without specifying a particular country or region, the claim lacks context and precision.

Given the variability and the lack of specific context, the claim could be seen as an oversimplification or a generalization that might not hold true universally.

Last year it was 55 percent, and now it is even less. This year, for the first time in history, Ankara’s dependence on supplies of Russian gas has dropped below 50 percent.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the historical and current data regarding Ankara's (Turkey's) dependence on Russian gas supplies.

1. **20 years ago**: It is claimed that Turkey's dependence on Russian gas was nearly 100 percent. Historically, Turkey has been heavily reliant on Russian gas, but it is unlikely that it was nearly 100 percent. Turkey has always had some level of diversification in its energy sources, though Russia has been a major supplier.

2. **Last year (2022)**: The claim states that Turkey's dependence on Russian gas was 55 percent. According to various reports, Turkey has been working to diversify its energy sources, including increasing imports from Azerbaijan, Iran, and LNG from various countries. The 55 percent figure seems plausible but would need specific data to confirm.

3. **This year (2023)**: The claim states that for the first time in history, Turkey's dependence on Russian gas has dropped below 50 percent. This aligns with Turkey's ongoing efforts to reduce reliance on Russian energy, especially in light of geopolitical tensions and the push for energy diversification.

Given the general trend of Turkey's energy diversification efforts and the plausible figures provided, the claim appears to be mostly accurate but may slightly overstate the historical dependence on Russian gas.

4. The content of the document, specifically whether it stated that there would be no war.

**Verification:**

1. **White Paper Existence**: President Bronisław Komorowski and Minister of National Defense Tomasz Siemoniak were indeed involved in the creation of a strategic defense document during their tenure in Poland.
2. **Experts Involvement**: The document was likely created with input from various experts, though the exact number (300) may be an exaggeration or a rounded figure.
3. **Timing**: The document was released before the significant escalation of conflict in Ukraine, which began in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the subsequent war in the Donbas region.
4. **Content**: The document likely contained assessments of regional security threats. However, predicting the exact nature and timing of conflicts is inherently challenging, and it is plausible that the document did not foresee an imminent large-scale war.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also potential exaggerations or misinterpretations, particularly regarding the number of experts and the specific content of the document.

The claim suggests that the speaker's work remains consistent, but the nature of the work changes with the construction season. Additionally, the speaker mentions that they are not more diligent than before, but they are no longer able to receive high-profile figures like Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.

1. **Work Consistency**: The speaker claims their work is the same as before, with variations due to the construction season. This part of the statement seems plausible, as many jobs have seasonal variations that affect the nature of the work without changing the overall workload or effort.

2. **Diligence**: The speaker asserts that their level of diligence has not changed. This is a subjective statement, but if taken at face value, it can be considered true based on the speaker's self-assessment.

3. **Receiving High-Profile Figures**: The speaker mentions they can no longer receive figures like Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin. This part of the statement is more specific and would depend on the context of the speaker's role and circumstances. If the speaker previously had a role that involved receiving such figures and no longer does, this part could be true.

3. **Number of Electric Cars**: The current number of electric cars on the roads in Poland is just under 1,000.
4. **Growth**: Half of the current electric cars were already in use 2 years ago.

Without specific data to verify these points, we can make a reasoned assessment based on general trends and available information up to the knowledge cutoff in 2023.

1. **Government Priority**: It is well-documented that many governments, including Poland's, have been pushing for increased electromobility as part of their environmental and economic strategies.
2. **Timeline**: If the Prime Minister made an announcement nearly 2 years ago, this would place the announcement around 2021.
3. **Number of Electric Cars**: According to various reports, the number of electric cars in Poland has been growing, but the exact number can vary. As of the latest data, the number of electric cars in Poland is likely higher than 1,000.
4. **Growth**: If half of the current electric cars were already in use 2 years ago, this would imply a slow growth rate, which may or may not align with actual growth trends.

1. **Judges in Poland Allegedly Chosen by Politicians**: This claim refers to the controversial judicial reforms in Poland, where the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), which is responsible for nominating judges, has been criticized for being influenced by political appointments. The European Union and other international bodies have raised concerns about the independence of the judiciary in Poland due to these reforms.

2. **Different Retirement Age in Poland**: Poland has indeed implemented changes to the retirement age for judges, which has been another point of contention. The European Court of Justice ruled that lowering the retirement age for Supreme Court judges in Poland was against EU law, as it undermined judicial independence.

1. **Serbia will lose Kosovo and Metohija**: Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, and while Serbia does not recognize this independence, many countries and international organizations do. The status of Kosovo is a complex and ongoing issue, but it is not solely dependent on the outcome of a single election.

2. **Serbia will lose the Raška region and Vojvodina**: There is no substantial evidence or ongoing political movement suggesting that Serbia is at risk of losing these regions based on the outcome of an election. Both regions are integral parts of Serbia with no significant separatist movements that would lead to their loss.

3. **Serbia will continue its agony in the European Union and the supposedly promised better life**: This is a subjective statement. Serbia is a candidate country for EU membership, and opinions on the benefits and drawbacks of EU integration vary widely. The term ""agony"" is a matter of perspective and not an objective fact.

2. **Prosecutors' Appointment Timeline**: The claim states that prosecutors were chosen by people from the regime to which Dragan Đilas belonged, specifically in 2009 and 2010. During this period, the Democratic Party was in power in Serbia, with Boris Tadić serving as President and Mirko Cvetković as Prime Minister.

3. **Appointment Process**: In Serbia, the appointment of prosecutors involves a selection process that includes proposals from the State Prosecutorial Council, which is influenced by the ruling government. Therefore, it is plausible that the prosecutors appointed during 2009 and 2010 were influenced by the Democratic Party's regime.

Given this context, the claim that ""prosecutors were chosen by people from the regime to which Dragan Đilas belonged, and that this happened in 2009 and 2010"" aligns with the historical and political context of Serbia during that period.

"Женщина, умершая от коронавируса, проснулась через месяц",half true,ru,A woman who died from coronavirus woke up a month later.,"Final Answer: False

The claim that a woman who died from coronavirus woke up a month later is not scientifically or medically plausible. Once a person is declared dead, they cannot come back to life. This claim is likely a fabrication or a misunderstanding of a different medical situation.",false,False,False
Из существовавших (в Казахской ССР) 47 рыбопитомников в настоящее время почти ничего не осталось…,half true,ru,"Of the 47 fish hatcheries that existed in the Kazakh SSR, almost nothing remains today…","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Of the 47 fish hatcheries that existed in the Kazakh SSR, almost nothing remains today,"" we need to consider the historical context and current status of fish hatcheries in Kazakhstan.

1. **Historical Context**: The Kazakh SSR (Soviet Socialist Republic) was part of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. During the Soviet era, there were indeed numerous fish hatcheries established to support aquaculture and fishery industries.

2. **Current Status**: Post-Soviet Union, many industries and infrastructures in former Soviet states faced significant challenges, including economic difficulties, lack of maintenance, and shifts in governmental priorities. This led to the decline or closure of many such facilities.

3. **Verification**: To verify the specific claim about the fish hatcheries, one would need access to detailed records or reports from both the Soviet era and contemporary Kazakhstan. However, it is well-documented that many industrial and agricultural facilities from the Soviet era have not been maintained or have been repurposed.

Given the general trend of decline in Soviet-era infrastructure and the specific mention of ""almost nothing remains,"" it is reasonable to infer that the claim is likely accurate, though it may not account for any remaining or repurposed facilities.

W Niemczech 55% mieszkań jest zasiedlonych na zasadzie najmu.,true,pl,"In Germany, 55% of residences are occupied on a rental basis.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Germany, 55% of residences are occupied on a rental basis,"" we need to look at reliable data sources such as statistics from the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) or other reputable housing studies.

According to data from Destatis and other housing market analyses, Germany has one of the highest rental rates in Europe. The percentage of households living in rental properties in Germany is typically reported to be around 50-55%.

Given this information, the claim that ""55% of residences are occupied on a rental basis"" is very close to the reported figures.

Коронавирус становится более заразным и более опасным,false,ru,The coronavirus is becoming more contagious and more dangerous.,"To evaluate the claim ""The coronavirus is becoming more contagious and more dangerous,"" we need to consider the current scientific understanding and evidence regarding the evolution of the virus.

1. **More Contagious**: Over the course of the pandemic, several variants of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged that are more transmissible than the original strain. For example, the Delta and Omicron variants have shown higher transmissibility, which has led to increased spread.

2. **More Dangerous**: The term ""more dangerous"" can be interpreted in different ways, such as increased severity of illness, higher mortality rates, or greater impact on healthcare systems. While some variants have been associated with increased severity (e.g., Delta), others like Omicron have shown to cause milder illness in many cases, especially among vaccinated individuals. However, the increased transmissibility of these variants can still lead to a higher number of cases, which can strain healthcare systems and result in more deaths overall, even if the individual risk of severe disease is lower.

Given this context, the claim is partially accurate but not entirely. The virus has become more contagious, but the danger it poses is more complex and varies depending on the variant and other factors like vaccination status and healthcare capacity.

"Jest program rządowy, który rozwija idee z ustawy. Nasza filozofia to zachęty. Możliwość wymiany pieców? To już trwa.",true,pl,There is a government program that develops the ideas from the law. Our philosophy is incentives. The possibility of replacing furnaces? That is already underway.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. ""There is a government program that develops the ideas from the law.""
2. ""Our philosophy is incentives.""
3. ""The possibility of replacing furnaces? That is already underway.""

1. Government programs often exist to develop and implement ideas from legislation. For example, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have programs that develop and implement energy efficiency and environmental laws.

2. Many government programs, especially those related to energy efficiency and environmental protection, use incentives as a key strategy to encourage compliance and adoption of new technologies. For instance, tax credits, rebates, and grants are common incentives.

3. Programs aimed at replacing old, inefficient furnaces with newer, more efficient models are indeed underway. For example, the DOE and various state programs offer incentives for upgrading to energy-efficient heating systems.

Given that each part of the claim has a basis in reality, the overall claim appears to be accurate.

Augustyn: 9 and something, it was single-digit.","To determine the accuracy of U. Augustyn's claim that the unemployment rate was ""single-digit"" when they were handing over power in 2015, we need to verify the actual unemployment rate at that time.

If the unemployment rate was indeed 9 and something percent, it would technically be a single-digit number, as it is less than 10 but more than 9. However, the context of the conversation suggests a debate over whether the rate was closer to 10% or not.

Given that 9.9% is still a single-digit number, U. Augustyn's statement is technically correct, though it might be seen as somewhat misleading if the rate was very close to 10%.

„Srbija je jedina zemlja čija vlast je lansirala parolu da EU nema alternativu“.,false,sr,"""Serbia is the only country whose government has launched the slogan that the EU has no alternative.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Serbia is the only country whose government has launched the slogan that the EU has no alternative,"" we need to consider the context and the specific use of the slogan.

1. **Serbia's Position on EU Membership**: Serbia has indeed been very vocal about its commitment to joining the European Union. The phrase ""the EU has no alternative"" has been used by Serbian officials to emphasize their dedication to EU integration.

2. **Other Countries' Slogans**: While many countries express strong commitments to EU membership, the specific phrasing ""the EU has no alternative"" is not commonly used as an official slogan by other governments. Other candidate countries or potential candidates may express similar sentiments but typically use different wording.

3. **Verification**: There is no widely available evidence that other countries have officially adopted this exact slogan in their governmental communications or campaigns.

Given this information, the claim appears to be accurate in the context of official governmental slogans.

What does this mean? It means that VAT is contributing to our budget, but VAT revenue is growing much more slowly than consumption is increasing.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the provided data and the statement's implications.

1. **Revenue Comparison**:
   - This year: 57.5 billion
   - Last year: 56.8 billion

   The increase in VAT revenue is 57.5 - 56.8 = 0.7 billion.

2. **Growth Rate Calculation**:
   - Growth rate = (Increase / Last year's revenue) * 100
   - Growth rate = (0.7 / 56.8) * 100 ≈ 1.23%

3. **Claim Analysis**:
   - The claim states that VAT revenue is growing much more slowly than consumption is increasing.
   - To verify this, we would need data on the rate of increase in consumption. However, this data is not provided in the statement.

Given the information, we can confirm that VAT revenue has increased, but without data on consumption growth, we cannot definitively compare the growth rates. Therefore, the claim that VAT revenue is growing much more slowly than consumption is increasing cannot be fully substantiated with the given data.

"Jestem zwolennikiem miękkiej liberalizacji na wzór niemiecki, który polega na tym, że jeżeli kobieta jest w sytuacji, kiedy jest skłonna usunąć ciążę, żeby nie robiła tego pochopnie, żeby przeszła przez proces konsultacji również psychologicznych, żeby decyzja ta nie była podejmowana nagle.",true,pl,"I am an advocate of soft liberalization in the German style, which means that if a woman is in a situation where she is inclined to terminate a pregnancy, she should not do it hastily, but go through a process of consultations, including psychological ones, so that the decision is not made suddenly.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the context of ""soft liberalization in the German style"" regarding abortion laws in Germany.

In Germany, abortion is generally illegal but is not punishable under certain conditions. One of these conditions is that the woman must undergo a mandatory counseling session at least three days before the procedure. The counseling is intended to provide information and support, ensuring that the decision is well-considered and not made hastily. This aligns with the idea of ""soft liberalization,"" where the process is regulated but not entirely prohibited, and includes psychological consultations.

Given this context, the claim accurately reflects the German approach to abortion, which involves a process of consultations, including psychological ones, to ensure that the decision is not made suddenly.

The claim appears to be misleading or false. VAT refunds are typically processed through official government channels or authorized agencies, not through a so-called ""Unified Compensation Center for Unpaid Funds Return."" Additionally, the specific mention of ""up to 270 thousand rubles"" seems arbitrary and not in line with standard VAT refund procedures.

"Nie wiem jaki będzie teraz deficyt, ale w tamtym roku brakowało 100 mln zł.",false,pl,"I don't know what the deficit will be now, but last year there was a shortfall of 100 million PLN.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""I don't know what the deficit will be now"" - This is a subjective statement expressing the speaker's current lack of knowledge about the present or future deficit. It cannot be fact-checked for truthfulness as it is a personal admission of uncertainty.

2. ""but last year there was a shortfall of 100 million PLN"" - This part of the statement can be fact-checked. If there was indeed a shortfall of 100 million PLN last year, then this part of the claim is true.

Given that the first part is a subjective statement and the second part can be verified, the overall truthfulness of the claim hinges on the accuracy of the second part. If the second part is accurate, the claim would be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the second part is inaccurate, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data to verify the exact shortfall from last year, we can only assess the structure of the statement. Assuming the second part is accurate based on the information provided:

"Wszystkie państwa, które weszły z Polską do Unii Europejskiej w 2004 dostały mniej, razem – [wszystkie te państwa] razem dostały mniej [funduszy] niż Polska.",false,pl,"All the countries that joined the European Union with Poland in 2004 received less, together – [all these countries] together received less [funds] than Poland.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the financial allocations from the European Union to the countries that joined in 2004, including Poland.

In 2004, the European Union expanded to include 10 new member states: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Cyprus, and Malta.

Poland, being the largest of these countries in terms of population and economic size, has indeed received a significant portion of EU funds. However, to verify the claim, we need to compare the total funds received by Poland with the combined total funds received by the other nine countries.

According to data from the European Commission and various financial reports, Poland has been the largest beneficiary of EU funds among the 2004 accession countries. However, the combined total funds received by the other nine countries collectively surpass the amount received by Poland alone.

Therefore, the claim that ""all these countries together received less [funds] than Poland"" is not accurate.

"Pan prezydent mówił, że w Gdańsku wszystkie tramwaje są niskopodłogowe. Nic dziwnego, że pan prezydent nie wie, że to nieprawda.",true,pl,The president said that all trams in Gdańsk are low-floor. No wonder the president doesn't know that this is not true.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the factual basis of the statement regarding the trams in Gdańsk and the president's knowledge.

1. **Fact-checking the statement about trams in Gdańsk:**
   - If all trams in Gdańsk are indeed low-floor, the statement would be true.
   - If not all trams in Gdańsk are low-floor, the statement would be false.

2. **Evaluating the president's knowledge:**
   - The claim suggests that the president is unaware of the actual situation. This part is more subjective and harder to verify without direct evidence of the president's knowledge or lack thereof.

Given that the statement is primarily about the factual status of the trams in Gdańsk, we should focus on that aspect.

**Research Findings:**
- If research or reliable sources indicate that not all trams in Gdańsk are low-floor, then the president's statement is incorrect.

Based on the information available, if it is confirmed that not all trams in Gdańsk are low-floor, the claim that ""all trams in Gdańsk are low-floor"" would be false. Consequently, the assertion that the president doesn't know this would be a reasonable inference, though it is more subjective.

This involves checking the official guidelines or policies that outline the process for parents to request religion classes for their children.

If the regulation explicitly states that parents must submit a written statement for their children to attend religion classes, then the claim would be 'True'. If the regulation has different requirements or if the process is not as described, the claim would be rated accordingly.

Without access to the specific regulation text, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the information provided and assuming it aligns with typical educational policies where parental consent is required for elective classes, the claim seems plausible.

2. **Freedom House Reports**: Freedom House provides annual reports on global freedom, which include detailed explanations of their methodology and sources. They often cite specific incidents, data points, and sources to back up their assessments.

3. **Reporters Without Borders (RSF) Reports**: RSF publishes the World Press Freedom Index, which includes a methodology section explaining how the data is collected and analyzed. They also provide sources and references for their findings.

1. **Context**: Vojislav Šešelj was indicted by the ICTY for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He voluntarily surrendered to the ICTY in 2003 and his trial began in 2007.

2. **Claim Analysis**: The claim states that there is ""absolutely no fact on the basis of which Šešelj could be accused"" and that his return to Serbia was expected in June or July of 2009.

3. **Outcome**: Šešelj was not acquitted in 2009. In fact, his trial continued for several more years. He was temporarily released in 2014 for health reasons and was eventually acquitted of some charges in 2016, but this was later partially overturned, and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018 for crimes against humanity.

To dzięki decyzjom Platformy Obywatelskiej 40% środków europejskich jest dystrybuowanych przez samorządy wojewódzkie.,true,pl,It is thanks to the decisions of the Civic Platform that 40% of European funds are distributed by regional governments.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""It is thanks to the decisions of the Civic Platform that 40% of European funds are distributed by regional governments,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Civic Platform's Role**: The Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) is a political party in Poland. To verify the claim, we need to establish whether the Civic Platform had a significant influence on the distribution of European funds during their time in power.

2. **European Funds Distribution**: European funds, particularly those from the European Union's cohesion policy, are often distributed through various levels of government, including national and regional authorities. The specific percentage of funds managed by regional governments can vary by country and funding period.

3. **Historical Context**: The Civic Platform was in power in Poland from 2007 to 2015. During this period, they would have had the opportunity to influence the distribution mechanisms of EU funds.

4. **Verification**: We need to check reliable sources or official documents to confirm if the Civic Platform's decisions directly led to 40% of European funds being distributed by regional governments.

Based on the information available, if we find that the Civic Platform indeed implemented policies or made decisions that resulted in regional governments distributing 40% of European funds, the claim would be accurate. If the percentage is different or if the Civic Platform's influence was not significant, the claim would be less accurate.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data, let's consider the following:

- If the Civic Platform's policies directly resulted in regional governments distributing a significant portion of European funds, but the exact percentage is slightly different, the claim could be ""Mostly True.""
- If the Civic Platform had some influence but the percentage is not close to 40%, it could be ""Half True"" or ""Mostly False.""
- If there is no evidence of the Civic Platform's decisions leading to this distribution, the claim would be ""False.""

Without specific data to confirm the exact percentage and the direct impact of the Civic Platform's decisions, we can make an educated assessment based on the available context.

1. **Full Digitalization**: This implies that the entire country has transitioned from analog to digital broadcasting.
2. **97.8 Percent Coverage**: This specific figure needs to be checked against reliable sources to confirm if 97.8 percent of the population is indeed covered by digital signal.
3. **Analog Signal Discontinuation**: This means that the analog signal has been completely phased out.

As of the latest available information, Serbia completed its digital switchover in June 2015. This transition involved moving from analog to digital terrestrial television broadcasting, which aligns with the claim of full digitalization and the discontinuation of the analog signal.

1. **Coal Reserves in Europe:**
   - Poland does have significant coal reserves, but it does not possess 90 percent of Europe's coal resources. According to various sources, Poland has a substantial share, but other countries like Germany and Ukraine also have considerable coal reserves.

2. **Energy Reliance:**
   - Poland does rely heavily on coal for its energy needs. Historically, coal has been a major part of Poland's energy mix, and the country has been one of the largest coal producers in Europe.

Given these points:
- The claim that Poland possesses 90 percent of Europe's coal resources is **False**.
- The claim that Poland relies predominantly on coal is **True**.

2. The SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) was in power from 1993 to 1997.
3. The Concordat was not ratified during the SLD's term in office. It was eventually ratified in 1998, after the SLD had left power.

1. The overall inflation rate for the previous year being 3.4%.
2. The increase in food prices in Poland being 7%.

If both pieces of information are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If one is accurate and the other is not, it would be 'Half True'. If both are inaccurate, it would be 'False'. If the information is mostly accurate but with minor discrepancies, it could be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False'.

Without specific data to verify these exact figures, I cannot definitively confirm the accuracy. However, if we assume the figures provided are correct based on available data or reports, the claim would be 'True'.

The decision of the EU Council of Ministers will be positive and the candidacy will be forwarded.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Whether the Netherlands has indeed decided not to block Serbia's candidacy for EU membership.
2. Whether the EU Council of Ministers has made a positive decision regarding Serbia's candidacy.
3. Whether Serbia's candidacy has been forwarded as a result of this decision.

Without specific and up-to-date information on these points, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and current information, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the Netherlands has officially decided not to block Serbia's candidacy, this part of the claim would be true.
- If the EU Council of Ministers has made a positive decision, this part would also be true.
- If Serbia's candidacy has been forwarded, this part would be true as well.

Given that the claim includes specific actions and decisions that need to be verified, and assuming that all these actions have indeed taken place as stated, the claim would be 'True'. However, without concrete evidence, it is prudent to consider the possibility of nuances or incomplete information.

"“Ja se izvinjavam što Srbija mnogo brže da napreduje, nikoga ugrožavajući, što je Srbija prošle godine pretekla sve po platama i penzijama, sem Crne Gore, ali se približila Crnoj Gori pa očekujem i to za godinu i po dana da preteknemo, da budemo broj jedan po svim parametrima u regionu. Mi smo javni dug spustili sa 78% na 50%, neki su sa 27% posto podigli na 55%, neki sa 50% na 75% u regionu.

We have reduced our public debt from 78% to 50%, while some have increased theirs from 27% to 55%, and others from 50% to 75% in the region. Our unemployment rate is the lowest.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Economic Growth and Advancement**: Serbia's economic growth rate and how it compares to other countries in the region.
2. **Salaries and Pensions**: The average salaries and pensions in Serbia compared to other countries in the region, particularly Montenegro.
3. **Public Debt**: The reduction of Serbia's public debt from 78% to 50% and the public debt changes in other regional countries.
4. **Unemployment Rate**: The current unemployment rate in Serbia and how it compares to other countries in the region.

### Economic Growth and Advancement
Serbia has shown significant economic growth in recent years, with GDP growth rates often outpacing some of its regional neighbors. However, ""advancing much faster"" is a relative term and would need specific comparative data to confirm.

### Salaries and Pensions
Serbia has made strides in increasing average salaries and pensions, but whether it has surpassed all other countries except Montenegro would require specific data. Montenegro has traditionally had higher average salaries and pensions compared to Serbia, but the gap has been narrowing.

### Public Debt
Serbia's public debt reduction from 78% to 50% is a significant achievement. However, verifying the exact figures and comparing them to other countries' debt changes is necessary. For instance, some countries in the region have indeed seen increases in their public debt ratios.

### Unemployment Rate
Serbia's unemployment rate has been decreasing and is among the lower rates in the region, but exact figures and comparisons are needed to confirm it is the lowest.

### Verification
- **Economic Growth**: Data from the World Bank and IMF can confirm Serbia's growth rates.
- **Salaries and Pensions**: National statistical offices and Eurostat provide comparative salary and pension data.
- **Public Debt**: IMF and World Bank data can confirm public debt figures.
- **Unemployment Rate**: Eurostat and national statistical offices provide unemployment rates.

### Conclusion
Given the available data and trends, the claim appears to be largely accurate but may contain some exaggerations or lack specific comparative details.

Wydajecie dodatkowe 35 mld zł na zakup F-35.,false,pl,You are spending an additional 35 billion PLN on the purchase of F-35s.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""You are spending an additional 35 billion PLN on the purchase of F-35s,"" we need to verify the actual cost and context of the F-35 purchase.

1. **Verification of Cost**: The cost of purchasing F-35 fighter jets can vary based on the number of units, the specific model, and additional costs such as maintenance, training, and support infrastructure. For example, Poland signed a deal in January 2020 to purchase 32 F-35A fighter jets for approximately $4.6 billion USD, which is roughly equivalent to 17.5 billion PLN at the exchange rate at that time.

2. **Context of ""Additional""**: The term ""additional"" implies that this expenditure is over and above a previously agreed amount. If there was no prior agreement or if the 35 billion PLN is the total cost rather than an additional cost, the claim would be misleading.

Given the information available, the claim that ""You are spending an additional 35 billion PLN on the purchase of F-35s"" appears to be an overstatement of the actual cost and may misrepresent the context of the expenditure.

"Spośród 500 opinii, które Komisja Wenecka wydała w ciągu ostatnich niemal 30 lat, niewielka ilość została jakoś tam nie uwzględniona – np. Rosja putinowska czy Lichtenstein.",true,pl,"Out of the 500 opinions issued by the Venice Commission over the past nearly 30 years, only a small number have been somehow disregarded – for example, Putin's Russia or Liechtenstein.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Venice Commission Overview**: The Venice Commission, formally known as the European Commission for Democracy through Law, is an advisory body of the Council of Europe, composed of independent experts in the field of constitutional law. It provides legal advice to its member states and helps them align their legal and institutional structures with European standards and international experience in democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.

2. **Number of Opinions**: The claim states that the Venice Commission has issued around 500 opinions over nearly 30 years. This is a reasonable estimate, as the Commission has been active since its establishment in 1990 and regularly issues opinions on various legal and constitutional matters.

3. **Disregarded Opinions**: The claim suggests that only a small number of these opinions have been disregarded, specifically mentioning Putin's Russia and Liechtenstein. While it is true that some countries may not fully implement the recommendations of the Venice Commission, the degree to which this happens can vary. Russia, under Putin, has indeed been known to disregard international advisory opinions, including those from the Venice Commission. Liechtenstein, on the other hand, is a less clear-cut case, as it generally has a good record of adhering to European standards.

Given the information available, the claim appears to be broadly accurate but may slightly overstate the uniformity of adherence to the Venice Commission's opinions across all countries. However, the specific mention of Russia and the general trend of high compliance lend credibility to the claim.

"„Plaćali smo sedam miliona evra za kredite koji su odobreni ranije ali nisu korišćeni. Mi nećemo platiti nijedan evro za te kredite, jer se projekti sada realizuju.“",false,sr,"""We paid seven million euros for loans that were approved earlier but were not used. We will not pay a single euro for those loans, because the projects are now being implemented.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""We paid seven million euros for loans that were approved earlier but were not used.""
2. ""We will not pay a single euro for those loans, because the projects are now being implemented.""

For the first part, the statement asserts that a payment of seven million euros was made for loans that were approved but not utilized. This implies that there was a financial commitment or cost associated with these unused loans.

For the second part, the statement claims that no further payments will be made for these loans because the projects are now being implemented. This suggests that the financial obligation tied to the unused loans has been resolved or negated by the commencement of the projects.

To evaluate the truthfulness of the entire claim, we need to verify:
- Whether the seven million euros were indeed paid for unused loans.
- Whether the implementation of the projects means no further payments are required for those loans.

Without additional context or evidence, it is challenging to fully verify both parts of the claim. However, if we assume the first part is accurate (the payment of seven million euros for unused loans), the second part hinges on the interpretation that the implementation of projects nullifies further payments.

Given the information provided, the claim seems to be internally consistent but lacks external verification. Therefore, it can be considered as having a significant degree of truth but with some uncertainty.

1. **Funding from ECA supports national export of goods and services**: This is generally true. ECAs are government or quasi-government institutions that provide financial support to promote the export of goods and services from their home country.

2. **Providing foreign customers with long-term loans**: This is also true. ECAs often provide long-term financing to foreign buyers to facilitate the purchase of goods and services from the ECA's home country.

3. **Up to 85% of a nuclear project**: This is a specific detail that can vary by ECA and project. However, it is not uncommon for ECAs to finance a significant portion of large-scale projects, including up to 85%.

4. **With very favorable interest rates**: ECAs typically offer competitive interest rates to make their financing attractive compared to commercial loans.

Given these points, the claim aligns well with the general practices of ECAs, though specific terms can vary by agency and project. Therefore, the claim is largely accurate but may not apply universally to all ECAs or all nuclear projects.

The claim states that patients do not receive the daily norms of essential nutrients like calcium, magnesium, iron, and vitamins, and instead receive an excessive amount of salt. Additionally, it mentions a lack of vegetables, fruits, and juices in their diet.

If the Supreme Audit Office has indeed reported these findings, then the claim would be accurate. However, without direct access to the specific report or confirmation from a reliable source, it is challenging to verify the exact details.

„Mali spoljni dug svedoči o velikom razvojnom potencijalu Srbije.“,false,sr,"""A small external debt testifies to Serbia's great development potential.""","To evaluate the claim that ""A small external debt testifies to Serbia's great development potential,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **External Debt and Development Potential**: A small external debt can indicate that a country is not heavily reliant on borrowing from foreign sources, which might suggest a stable economic situation. However, it does not automatically equate to great development potential. Development potential is influenced by various factors including economic policies, political stability, infrastructure, education, and innovation.

2. **Economic Context**: Serbia's development potential would also depend on its GDP growth rate, investment in key sectors, and overall economic strategy. A low external debt might be a positive indicator, but it is not the sole determinant of development potential.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing Serbia's external debt to other countries with similar economic profiles could provide more context. Some countries with low external debt might still struggle with development due to other issues like poor governance or lack of investment in human capital.

Given these considerations, the claim oversimplifies the relationship between external debt and development potential. While a small external debt can be a positive sign, it does not alone testify to great development potential without considering other critical factors.

"Pan Janusz Korwin-Mikke, który jest zatrudniony, ubezpiecza się w KRUSie.",true,pl,"Mr. Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who is employed, insures himself with KRUS.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the context and specifics of the situation:

1. **KRUS (Kasa Rolniczego Ubezpieczenia Społecznego)**: This is the Agricultural Social Insurance Fund in Poland, which provides social insurance for farmers. Typically, KRUS is for individuals who are engaged in agricultural activities and meet specific criteria related to farming.

2. **Employment Status**: If Mr. Janusz Korwin-Mikke is employed in a non-agricultural sector, it would be unusual for him to be insured with KRUS, as KRUS is specifically for farmers.

3. **Public Figures**: Janusz Korwin-Mikke is a well-known Polish politician and public figure. His primary occupation is not farming, which would make it unlikely for him to be insured with KRUS.

Given these points, the claim that Mr. Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who is employed (presumably in a non-agricultural sector), insures himself with KRUS is highly unlikely.

W skali przemysłowej można szacować wielkość jego wydobycia (metanu) w granicach 1-2 mld m3 rocznie.,false,pl,"On an industrial scale, the volume of its extraction (methane) can be estimated to be within the range of 1-2 billion cubic meters annually.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that the volume of methane extraction on an industrial scale can be estimated to be within the range of 1-2 billion cubic meters annually, we need to consider the global context of methane production.

Methane is a significant component of natural gas, and its extraction is a major industry worldwide. According to data from various energy agencies, global natural gas production is measured in trillions of cubic meters annually. For instance, in 2020, global natural gas production was approximately 3.9 trillion cubic meters. Methane constitutes the majority of natural gas, so the volume of methane extracted is also in the trillions of cubic meters range annually.

Given this context, the claim that methane extraction on an industrial scale is within the range of 1-2 billion cubic meters annually is significantly lower than the actual global figures.

1. **Identify the parliamentary groups, clubs, or circles**: We need to know all the groups that participated in the vote.
2. **Check the voting records**: We need to verify how each group voted on the salary increase project.
3. **Confirm the claim**: Determine if Confederation was indeed the only group that voted entirely against the project.

Without access to the specific voting records, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the context provided is accurate and based on verified data, we can proceed with the analysis.

If the Confederation was the only group that had all its members vote against the project, while other groups had mixed votes or voted in favor, the claim would be true.

**Assumptions**:
- The claim is based on verified voting records.
- No other group had a unanimous vote against the project.

1. **Wrocław**: According to available data, Wrocław has around 12% green areas, including parks, gardens, and forests. The claim that almost 8% of this is forests around Wrocław aligns with some reports, but exact figures can vary slightly depending on the source.

2. **Katowice**: Katowice is known for its significant green spaces, with some sources indicating that green areas make up over 40% of the city. This includes parks, forests, and other green spaces.

3. **Zielona Góra**: Zielona Góra is also recognized for its extensive green areas, with reports suggesting that green spaces constitute over 40% of the city.

Given this information, the claim that Wrocław has just over 12% green areas, with almost 8% being forests, and that Katowice and Zielona Góra have over 40% greenery, appears to be accurate.

Why can the British and French pay 5% VAT, and so can 8 other countries in the European Union, while Poles have to pay 23%?","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the VAT rates on electricity in Poland, the UK, France, and other EU countries.

1. **VAT Rate on Electricity in Poland**: As of the latest data, Poland's standard VAT rate is 23%, which applies to electricity.

2. **VAT Rate on Electricity in the UK**: The UK has a reduced VAT rate of 5% on domestic electricity.

3. **VAT Rate on Electricity in France**: France also applies a reduced VAT rate of 5.5% on domestic electricity.

4. **Other EU Countries**: Several other EU countries have reduced VAT rates on electricity. For example, Germany has a reduced rate of 7%, and Italy has a reduced rate of 10%.

5. **Highest VAT Rate in the EU**: While Poland's 23% VAT rate on electricity is high, it is not the highest standard VAT rate in the EU. Hungary, for example, has a standard VAT rate of 27%, but it may not apply this rate to electricity.

Given this information, the claim that Poland's VAT on electricity is the highest in the EU is not accurate, as other countries have higher standard VAT rates, though they may apply reduced rates to electricity. The claim that the UK and France have lower VAT rates on electricity is accurate.

(...) The unlawful decision to aggress against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was primarily based on William Walker's reports, even though there was no humanitarian catastrophe or persecution of Kosovo Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija in 1998-1999.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to break down the key points and assess their accuracy based on historical records and available evidence:

1. **William Walker's Role and Reports**: William Walker was the head of the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1998-1999. His reports, particularly on the Racak massacre in January 1999, were significant in shaping international opinion and justifying NATO's intervention. However, the interpretation of these events has been contested, with some arguing that Walker's reports were biased or exaggerated.

2. **Greater Albania Ambitions**: The claim that William Walker has ""Greater Albania ambitions and projects"" is a serious accusation. While Walker has expressed support for Kosovo's independence, there is no substantial evidence to suggest he actively promotes a Greater Albania agenda, which would involve uniting all Albanian-populated territories into a single state.

3. **Opposition to the Special Court**: The Special Court for Kosovo, established to prosecute crimes committed by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), has faced opposition from various quarters, including some Kosovo Albanians. However, attributing this opposition directly to Walker without concrete evidence is speculative.

4. **Humanitarian Catastrophe and Persecution**: The claim that there was no humanitarian catastrophe or persecution of Kosovo Albanians in 1998-1999 contradicts numerous reports from international organizations, including the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, which documented widespread atrocities, including ethnic cleansing, mass killings, and forced displacement of Kosovo Albanians by Yugoslav and Serbian forces.

5. **NATO's Decision to Intervene**: NATO's intervention in Yugoslavia was based on multiple factors, including reports of human rights abuses and the failure of diplomatic efforts. While Walker's reports were influential, they were not the sole basis for the intervention.

Given these points, the claim contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate elements. Therefore, the most appropriate classification is:

1. The claim states there are about 10,000 judges in Poland.
2. It also states that these judges handle nearly 15 million cases annually.
3. Therefore, on average, each judge would handle 15 million cases / 10,000 judges = 1,500 cases per year.

The arithmetic checks out, as 15 million divided by 10,000 does indeed equal 1,500. However, the accuracy of the claim also depends on the validity of the initial numbers provided (10,000 judges and 15 million cases annually).

If these numbers are accurate, then the claim is correct. Without specific data to refute these numbers, we can assume they are reasonably accurate for the purpose of this evaluation.

2. Whether this law also included provisions related to members of the Military Council of National Salvation (Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego, WRON).
3. Whether the Constitutional Tribunal repealed this provision.

1. In 2008, Poland did indeed introduce a law that reduced pensions for former employees of the communist-era security services, including the UB and SB.
2. The law also targeted members of the Military Council of National Salvation (WRON), which was a body that imposed martial law in Poland in 1981.
3. The Constitutional Tribunal of Poland did rule on aspects of this law. In 2010, the Tribunal found certain provisions of the law unconstitutional, which affected the implementation of the pension reductions.

1. ""Because only here do you study English for 12 years and don't know English.""
   - This is a broad generalization. While it may be true that some students in certain countries study English for many years and still struggle with proficiency, it is not unique to any one country. Many factors, such as the quality of education, teaching methods, and exposure to the language, can influence language acquisition.

2. ""And we don't learn another language.""
   - This statement is also a generalization. The requirement to learn additional languages varies by country and education system. Many countries have mandatory second language education, though the effectiveness and outcomes can vary.

3. ""And look at our politicians, none of them know English, except for those who have lived abroad, not to mention that no one knows Russian.""
   - This is a specific claim that would require data on the language proficiency of politicians in the country being referred to. It is unlikely that ""none"" of the politicians know English, as English is a widely spoken second language globally. The claim about Russian proficiency is also broad and would need specific evidence.

4. ""And I won't even say that we can't find a single translator for French, let alone for German.""
   - This is an exaggerated claim. Most countries have professional translators for major languages, including French and German. The availability of translators can depend on the demand and the presence of language education programs.

5. ""In the Netherlands, they learn Chinese from a young age, but here we don't.""
   - While it is true that the Netherlands has a strong emphasis on multilingual education, including English, Dutch, and often other languages, the claim that they learn Chinese from a young age is not universally applicable. Chinese may be offered in some schools, but it is not a standard part of the curriculum for all students.

Większość warszawiaków dobrze ocenia prezydenturę Hanny Gronkiewicz-Waltz,true,pl,Most residents of Warsaw have a positive opinion of Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz's presidency.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Most residents of Warsaw have a positive opinion of Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz's presidency,"" we need to consider public opinion data, surveys, and other reliable sources that reflect the views of Warsaw residents during her time in office.

Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz served as the Mayor of Warsaw from 2006 to 2018. Throughout her tenure, public opinion varied, with periods of both high and low approval ratings. For instance, she was re-elected multiple times, indicating significant support at various points. However, her later years in office were marked by controversies, including issues related to the Warsaw reprivatization scandal, which negatively impacted her approval ratings.

Given the fluctuating nature of public opinion over her long tenure, it is challenging to definitively state that ""most residents"" consistently had a positive opinion throughout her entire presidency without specific, up-to-date polling data.

W 2016 po raz pierwszy więcej osób do Polski przyjechało niż wyjechało [liczone od czasów wojny].,false,pl,"In 2016, for the first time, more people came to Poland than left [counted since the war].","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In 2016, for the first time, more people came to Poland than left [counted since the war],"" we need to examine migration statistics and historical data for Poland.

1. **Historical Context**: Since World War II, Poland has experienced various migration trends, including significant emigration during the communist era and after joining the European Union in 2004.

2. **Migration Data**: According to data from Poland's Central Statistical Office (GUS) and other sources, 2016 marked a notable shift in migration patterns. For the first time in recent history, Poland recorded a positive net migration rate, meaning more people immigrated to Poland than emigrated.

3. **Verification**: Reports and statistical data from 2016 confirm that Poland experienced a net positive migration rate, driven by economic improvements and an influx of workers from other countries, including Ukraine.

Based on this information, the claim appears to be accurate.

If the voter turnout is indeed slightly above 30%, the claim would be considered accurate. However, without specific data, we can only hypothesize.

Assuming the turnout is, for example, 31%, 32%, or any figure just above 30%, the claim would be 'True'. If the turnout is exactly 30%, it would be 'Half True' since ""just over"" implies a figure slightly above 30%. If the turnout is significantly different from 30%, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we can only provide a general guideline:

- If the turnout is slightly above 30%, the claim is 'True'.
- If the turnout is exactly 30%, the claim is 'Half True'.
- If the turnout is significantly different from 30%, the claim is 'False'.

1. **First Round Turnout**: The claim states that the turnout was about 50% two weeks ago.
2. **Current Turnout**: The claim states that the current turnout is 30%.

Without access to the specific data from the Jarosław municipality, it is not possible to definitively verify these percentages. However, if we assume the data provided in the claim is accurate, the statement would be considered 'True'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, we can only assess it based on the information provided.

The claim suggests a deliberate intention to destroy over 6,000 educational institutions in Poland, affecting more than 100,000 teachers. 

1. **Context**: The claim could be related to a specific policy, political statement, or historical event. Without additional context, it's challenging to assess the intent behind the destruction of educational institutions.

2. **Evidence**: There is no widely known or documented evidence that supports the claim that there is an active plan or intention to destroy over 6,000 educational institutions in Poland. 

3. **Verification**: Reliable sources such as government statements, educational reports, or credible news outlets would need to confirm such a significant and impactful action.

   - This statement is subjective and depends on the context of the law being discussed. Without specific details, it's difficult to assess its truthfulness.

2. ""That means it was abolished a long time ago,""
   - The clarity of a law does not necessarily imply that it was abolished. In fact, a clear law could still be in effect. This part of the statement is misleading.

3. ""and that, I think, by their own will, I'm not sure.""
   - This part of the statement is speculative and indicates uncertainty. It does not provide a factual basis for the claim.

"Polska dostarcza w tej grupie dwóch milionów pracowników delegowanych, którzy co roku poruszają się po Europie, około 1/4 – pół miliona.",true,pl,"Poland provides in this group of two million posted workers, who move around Europe every year, about 1/4 – half a million.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The total number of posted workers in Europe annually.
2. The number of posted workers provided by Poland annually.

According to the European Commission, posted workers are employees sent by their employer to carry out a service in another EU Member State on a temporary basis. The number of posted workers in the EU is estimated to be around 2 million annually.

Poland is one of the largest providers of posted workers in the EU. Data from the European Commission and other sources indicate that Poland contributes a significant number of posted workers, often cited to be around 500,000 annually.

Given this information, the claim that Poland provides about 1/4 (which is 500,000) of the 2 million posted workers in Europe annually appears to be accurate.

1. **Source of the Claim**: The claim appears to be based on studies and reports from health and environmental organizations. For instance, the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published reports on the health impacts of air pollution in Europe, including Poland.

2. **Data from Reports**: According to the EEA's reports, air pollution is a significant health issue in Poland, with particulate matter (PM2.5) being a major contributor. The EEA's 2020 report estimated that around 47,500 premature deaths in Poland were attributable to PM2.5 exposure in 2018. This figure aligns with the claim that over 40,000 people die annually due to smog.

3. **Expert Consensus**: Multiple studies and health assessments corroborate the severe impact of air pollution on public health in Poland. The numbers often cited in these reports are based on comprehensive epidemiological studies and modeling.

Given this information, the claim that ""Over 40,000 people die annually in Poland due to smog"" is supported by credible sources and data.

1. The dividend paid into the budget of the City of Belgrade by public utility companies in 2013 was indeed 680 million dinars.
2. The dividend paid into the budget of the City of Belgrade by public utility companies in the current year is indeed 5.1 billion dinars.
3. The increase from 680 million dinars to 5.1 billion dinars represents an almost eightfold increase.

Let's break down the calculations:

- 5.1 billion dinars divided by 680 million dinars equals approximately 7.5.

This means the increase is indeed close to eight times.

If the provided figures for 2013 and the current year are accurate, then the claim is correct. However, without independent verification of these figures, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim based on the provided data.

1. **Authority to Receive Information**: The Minister of Defense typically has the authority to receive various types of information from the Military Counterintelligence Service. This is part of the oversight and control functions that the Minister of Defense exercises over military and defense-related activities.

2. **Access to Operational Materials**: Operational materials often include sensitive and classified information related to ongoing operations, sources, methods, and other critical intelligence. Access to such materials is usually restricted to protect the integrity of operations and the safety of personnel. However, the exact extent of the Minister of Defense's access to these materials can vary based on national laws and regulations.

Given these points, the claim that the Minister of Defense is authorized to receive various information from the SKW but is not authorized to familiarize himself with any operational materials seems to be an oversimplification. While the Minister may have broad access to information, there could be specific restrictions on certain types of operational materials.

1. ""I think the question of whether you have a doctorate or not, and how you obtained it, is more of a private matter.""
   - This is a subjective opinion. Whether the details of one's doctorate are considered private can vary depending on context, such as public office or academic integrity.

2. ""As for the resignation, I believe it is an individual act of each person, whether you will offer a resignation somewhere or not...""
   - This is also a subjective opinion. Resignation is indeed a personal decision, though it can be influenced by external factors like public pressure or organizational policies.

3. ""But, in any case, we will wait for the minister himself to address this in the coming days.""
   - This is a statement about future events and implies that the minister will provide clarification. The truth of this part depends on whether the minister actually addresses the issue in the coming days.

Given that the claim is largely based on subjective opinions and a future event that cannot be verified at this moment, it is difficult to categorize it strictly as true or false. However, the statements themselves are not factually incorrect but rather opinions and predictions.

If there is no evidence of disputes or conflicts and it is confirmed that they did not collaborate, the claim would be 'True'. If there is some evidence of minor disputes or conflicts, it might be 'Mostly True'.

Whoever shows me such a country, I'll take them out to dinner.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine historical data on budget deficits from various countries. The claim is that a country has managed to reduce its budget deficit from eight percent to less than two percent of GDP in just two years. 

There are instances where countries have made significant fiscal adjustments in a short period, often due to austerity measures, economic reforms, or recovery from economic crises. For example, countries like Ireland and Greece have implemented severe austerity measures that resulted in substantial reductions in their budget deficits over a short period. However, the specific reduction from eight percent to less than two percent in exactly two years is a very stringent criterion.

Given the rarity and the specific nature of the claim, it is challenging to find a precise example that fits this exact scenario without extensive and detailed historical economic data analysis. Therefore, while significant reductions in budget deficits are possible, the exact claim as stated is highly unlikely.

"Смертность от этого рукотворного вируса - 0,03%, то есть многократно ниже чем от сезонной простуды или сезонного гриппа",half true,ru,"The mortality rate from this man-made virus is 0.03%, which is many times lower than that of the seasonal cold or seasonal flu.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare the stated mortality rate of the man-made virus (0.03%) with the mortality rates of the seasonal cold and seasonal flu.

1. **Seasonal Cold**: The common cold is generally not associated with a significant mortality rate. It is typically caused by rhinoviruses and other similar viruses, and while it can lead to complications in vulnerable populations, it is not usually fatal.

2. **Seasonal Flu**: The mortality rate for seasonal influenza varies from year to year and can be influenced by the specific strain of the virus, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine, and other factors. However, the mortality rate for seasonal flu is generally estimated to be around 0.1% to 0.2%.

Given these points:
- The claim states that the mortality rate of the man-made virus is 0.03%.
- This rate is indeed lower than the typical mortality rate of the seasonal flu (0.1% to 0.2%).
- The common cold has a negligible mortality rate, so comparing it to 0.03% is not meaningful.

Therefore, the claim that the mortality rate of the man-made virus is many times lower than that of the seasonal flu is accurate. However, the comparison to the seasonal cold is not relevant due to the negligible mortality rate of the common cold.

1. **Transparency International Reports**: Check the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) for Serbia, which includes Belgrade, over the past few years. If the scores have been improving, it would support the claim.
2. **Local Government Reports**: Look for any local government or independent reports on transparency initiatives and their outcomes in Belgrade.
3. **Media and Public Opinion**: Review media reports and public opinion surveys regarding transparency and corruption in Belgrade.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if there is evidence of consistent improvement in transparency metrics and positive feedback from credible sources, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'True'. Conversely, if there is little to no improvement or mixed results, it might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

1. **Population and Infrastructure Data**: Warsaw is the capital city of Poland, with a population of approximately 1.8 million people. The city is known for having a well-developed infrastructure, including sewage systems.

2. **Sewage System Coverage**: According to various reports and municipal data, Warsaw has a high coverage rate for its sewage system. The majority of the population is connected to the municipal sewage system, with only a small percentage of residents not having direct access.

3. **Specific Numbers**: While exact numbers can vary, reports suggest that the percentage of people without access to the sewage system in Warsaw is relatively low. For instance, if we consider a conservative estimate where 5% of the population might not have access, that would be around 90,000 people. However, this is still an overestimation, as the actual percentage is likely lower.

Given this context, the claim that ""More than 100,000 people in Warsaw do not have access to a sewage system"" appears to be an overstatement.

Alongside, the Germans saw a rise in the prices of electricity, as well as greater volatility in the electrical grid.","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider several aspects:

1. **CO2 Emissions**: Germany has indeed seen fluctuations in CO2 emissions since it began decommissioning nuclear reactors. The country has increased its reliance on coal and natural gas to compensate for the loss of nuclear power, which has led to periods of increased CO2 emissions. However, Germany is also investing heavily in renewable energy sources, which has helped mitigate some of the increases in emissions.

2. **Electricity Prices**: The transition away from nuclear power has contributed to higher electricity prices in Germany. The costs associated with building and integrating renewable energy infrastructure, as well as the need to import energy at times, have driven up prices.

3. **Grid Volatility**: The shift to renewable energy sources, which can be intermittent (like solar and wind), has introduced greater volatility in the electrical grid. Managing this volatility requires additional infrastructure and technology, which can be challenging and costly.

Given these points, the claim has a basis in reality but may not capture the full complexity of the situation, such as the significant investments in renewable energy and the long-term goals of reducing emissions.

Electricity prices can vary significantly based on several factors, including government policies, energy sources, and market conditions. Historically, France has had relatively low electricity prices compared to many other European countries, largely due to its significant reliance on nuclear power, which provides a stable and often cheaper source of electricity.

However, saying that France has the ""cheapest"" electricity in Europe is an absolute statement that requires current and specific comparative data. As of the latest available data, countries like Bulgaria and Hungary have been reported to have lower electricity prices than France. Therefore, while France may have relatively low electricity prices, it is not accurate to claim it has the cheapest.

1. **""Accepting immigrants into Poland increases the threat of terrorism""**: This is a broad and generalized statement. There is no definitive evidence that directly links accepting immigrants into Poland with an increased threat of terrorism. Terrorism is a complex issue influenced by many factors, and attributing it solely to immigration oversimplifies the problem.

2. **""Explosions in Paris""**: The Paris attacks in November 2015 were carried out by individuals, some of whom had links to ISIS. While some attackers had entered Europe posing as refugees, it is not accurate to generalize this to all immigrants or refugees.

3. **""Explosions in Brussels""**: The Brussels bombings in March 2016 were also carried out by individuals with links to ISIS. Similar to the Paris attacks, some of the attackers had connections to the refugee crisis, but this does not imply a direct causation between accepting immigrants and increased terrorism.

4. **""Explosion a few days ago in Ankara""**: The claim refers to an attack in Ankara, Turkey. The specifics of the attack and the identity of the perpetrator would need to be verified. However, attributing this attack to a refugee without concrete evidence is speculative.

5. **""Refugee was the perpetrator of that attack""**: This part of the claim needs specific verification. If the perpetrator was indeed a refugee, it would need to be confirmed by credible sources.

Given the complexity and the need for precise evidence to support such claims, the statement makes broad generalizations and lacks sufficient evidence to be considered accurate.

"PKB per capita na głowę mieszkańca w Polsce rośnie, myśmy na przykład w ostatnich dwóch latach wyprzedzili Grecję.",true,pl,"GDP per capita in Poland is increasing; for example, in the last two years, we have surpassed Greece.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""GDP per capita in Poland is increasing; for example, in the last two years, we have surpassed Greece,"" we need to examine recent data on GDP per capita for both Poland and Greece.

1. **GDP per Capita Trends**: 
   - Poland has experienced economic growth over the past few years, which has led to an increase in GDP per capita.
   - Greece, on the other hand, has faced economic challenges, including a severe financial crisis that has impacted its GDP per capita.

2. **Comparative Data**:
   - According to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) data, Poland's GDP per capita has been on an upward trend.
   - Recent data (as of 2021 and 2022) shows that Poland's GDP per capita has indeed surpassed that of Greece.

Given this information, the claim that Poland's GDP per capita is increasing and that it has surpassed Greece in the last two years is supported by available data.

Meanwhile, the State Forests invest too little in the protection of Polish forests.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. **Existence of a Report by the Supreme Audit Office (NiK) Since 2015**: Confirm if there is a report by NiK since 2015 that addresses the financial problems of the State Forests.
2. **Content of the Report**: Check if the report explicitly states that the financial problems of the State Forests are due to high administrative costs and high fixed costs.
3. **Investment in Forest Protection**: Verify if the report mentions that the State Forests invest too little in the protection of Polish forests.

Without access to the specific report, we can only make an educated guess based on the typical content of such reports and the general knowledge about the State Forests' financial and operational issues.

Given that the claim is specific and detailed, it is likely based on some factual information. However, without the exact report to confirm every detail, we cannot be entirely certain of its complete accuracy.

This requires access to the records or transcripts of the Assembly sessions to confirm the frequency and content of the speaker's statements.

Without access to these records, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the speaker is accurately recounting their actions, the claim could be considered 'True'.

According to the former minister's announcements, the involvement of the Polish industry was supposed to be as high as 50 percent. At this moment, it is not even 5 percent.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the following points:

1. **Macierewicz's Announcement**: Did Macierewicz indeed announce that the Wisła program would involve the Polish industry up to 50 percent?
2. **Current Involvement**: Is the current involvement of the Polish industry in the Wisła program less than 5 percent?

If both points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If only one point is accurate, it would be 'Half True'. If neither point is accurate, it would be 'False'. If the claim is mostly accurate but with some minor inaccuracies, it would be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the nature of the inaccuracies.

Given the information provided:
- Macierewicz did announce a significant involvement of the Polish industry in the Wisła program.
- The current involvement is reported to be less than 5 percent.

1. **Number of WADA Accredited Laboratories**: As of the latest information available, WADA has a network of around 30 accredited laboratories worldwide. This number can fluctuate slightly due to new accreditations or suspensions.

2. **Warsaw Laboratory**: Poland does have a WADA-accredited laboratory located in Warsaw.

3. **African Laboratory**: There is indeed only one WADA-accredited laboratory in Africa, which is located in Bloemfontein, South Africa.

"Nie może być tak, że córka radnej miejskiej Marty Wcisło bez żadnego konkursu zostaje mianowana wiceprezesem jednej ze spółek-córek spółki miejskiej",true,pl,It cannot be that the daughter of city councilor Marta Wcisło is appointed vice president of one of the subsidiaries of a municipal company without any competition.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Legal and Regulatory Framework**: Are there specific laws or regulations that mandate a competitive process for appointing vice presidents in municipal company subsidiaries?
2. **Company Policies**: Does the municipal company or its subsidiaries have internal policies that require a competitive selection process for such appointments?
3. **Precedents and Practices**: What has been the historical practice for similar appointments within the municipal company and its subsidiaries?

Without specific information on the legal, regulatory, and policy context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that typical practices and good governance principles are followed, it is generally expected that appointments to significant positions in public or municipal entities should be made through a competitive process to ensure transparency and meritocracy.

Given this context, the claim that it ""cannot be"" that the daughter of a city councilor is appointed without any competition suggests a strong assertion that such an appointment would be against standard practices or regulations.

**Analysis**:
- If there are explicit rules or laws requiring a competitive process, the claim would be 'True'.
- If it is generally expected but not strictly mandated, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.
- If there are no such requirements, the claim would be 'False'.

Based on the general expectation of transparency and meritocracy in public appointments, but without specific legal or policy details, the most balanced assessment would be:

Лапша быстрого приготовления — опасная ГМО-пища,half true,ru,Instant noodles are dangerous GMO food.,"To evaluate the claim ""Instant noodles are dangerous GMO food,"" we need to break it down into two parts: the assertion that instant noodles are GMO (genetically modified organisms) and the assertion that they are dangerous.

1. **GMO Status**: Not all instant noodles are made from genetically modified ingredients. The use of GMOs in food products varies by brand and region. Some instant noodles may contain GMO ingredients, while others may not. Therefore, it is not accurate to generalize that all instant noodles are GMO.

2. **Dangerous**: The term ""dangerous"" is subjective and can be interpreted in various ways. The safety of GMOs is a topic of ongoing debate, but major scientific organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Academy of Sciences, have stated that GMOs currently on the market are no more risky to human health than conventional foods. Instant noodles, like many processed foods, can be unhealthy if consumed in large quantities due to high levels of sodium, preservatives, and lack of essential nutrients, but this is not specific to their GMO status.

Given these points, the claim is misleading because it overgeneralizes and conflates different issues.

"EXPO 2017 в Астане обошёлся дешевле, чем в других странах",half true,ru,EXPO 2017 in Astana cost less than in other countries.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""EXPO 2017 in Astana cost less than in other countries,"" we need to compare the costs of EXPO 2017 in Astana with the costs of other recent World Expos.

EXPO 2017 in Astana, Kazakhstan, reportedly cost around $3 billion. For comparison:
- EXPO 2010 in Shanghai, China, cost approximately $55 billion.
- EXPO 2015 in Milan, Italy, cost around $2.8 billion.

Based on these figures, EXPO 2017 in Astana did indeed cost less than EXPO 2010 in Shanghai but was slightly more expensive than EXPO 2015 in Milan. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but has some truth to it.

1. **Kosovo's Declaration of Independence in 2008**: Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008. This is a well-documented historical event.

2. **Đilas, Jeremić, Tadić, and others in power in 2008**: 
   - **Boris Tadić** was the President of Serbia from 2004 to 2012.
   - **Vuk Jeremić** was the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2007 to 2012.
   - **Dragan Đilas** was the Mayor of Belgrade from 2008 to 2013, and he was also a prominent political figure in the Democratic Party during that period.

3. **Reaction to Kosovo's Declaration**: The Serbian government, led by Tadić and his administration, strongly opposed Kosovo's declaration of independence. They issued statements condemning the declaration and sought international support to prevent recognition of Kosovo as an independent state. The claim that they issued ""two ridiculous statements"" is subjective and would require further context to evaluate the nature and impact of those statements.

Given these points:
- The claim accurately identifies the key political figures in power during Kosovo's declaration of independence.
- The characterization of their response as ""two ridiculous statements"" is subjective and not a verifiable fact.

"Trybunał Europejski wyraził pogląd, że przymus do jakichkolwiek czynności medycznych jest sprzeczny z prawami człowieka.",false,pl,The European Court expressed the view that coercion into any medical procedures is contrary to human rights.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and its stance on coercion into medical procedures. The ECHR has consistently upheld the principle that individuals have the right to bodily integrity and autonomy, which includes the right to make decisions about their own medical treatment. This is rooted in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life.

However, the ECHR has also recognized that this right is not absolute and can be subject to certain restrictions, provided they are in accordance with the law, pursue a legitimate aim, and are necessary in a democratic society. For example, compulsory vaccinations or other public health measures might be justified under certain circumstances.

Given this context, the claim that ""The European Court expressed the view that coercion into any medical procedures is contrary to human rights"" is somewhat oversimplified. The ECHR does generally oppose coercion into medical procedures as a violation of human rights, but it allows for exceptions under specific conditions.

The 500+ program, introduced in Poland in 2016, provides financial support to families with children. The goal of the program was to increase the fertility rate by reducing the financial burden on families.

According to data from Statistics Poland (GUS), the fertility rate did see a slight increase after the introduction of the 500+ program. In 2015, the fertility rate was 1.32 children per woman, and it increased to 1.45 in 2017. However, this increase was not sustained in the long term, as the fertility rate began to decline again in subsequent years, reaching 1.38 in 2019 and continuing to fluctuate around similar levels.

Therefore, while there was an initial increase in the fertility rate following the introduction of the 500+ program, the effect was not long-lasting, and the rate did not continue to rise significantly.

Finland is often cited for its high-performing education system, particularly in the early 2000s when it consistently ranked near the top in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) conducted by the OECD. However, in recent years, other countries such as Singapore, Japan, and South Korea have also achieved top rankings in various educational assessments.

While Finland continues to perform well, it does not hold the top position in all possible studies. For example, in the most recent PISA results, Finland remains strong but is not the absolute leader in every category. Additionally, other assessments like TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) and PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) show that other countries also excel in different areas.

Therefore, the claim that Finland has the best educational results in all possible studies is an overstatement.

France has 100%.","To determine the accuracy of the claim regarding the debt-to-GDP ratios of Germany, the country in question (presumably the speaker's country), and France, we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available from credible sources such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, or national statistical agencies.

1. **Germany**: According to the IMF and other financial reports, Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio has been around 70-75% in recent years, but it has fluctuated due to economic conditions, especially considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the latest data, it is not exactly 80%, but it is close.

2. **The speaker's country**: Without knowing the specific country the speaker is referring to, it's challenging to verify the 51% claim. However, many countries have debt-to-GDP ratios around this range, so it could be plausible.

3. **France**: France's debt-to-GDP ratio has been over 100% in recent years, especially after the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest figures from the IMF and other sources confirm that France's debt-to-GDP ratio is indeed around or slightly above 100%.

Given this information:

- The claim about Germany is slightly overstated but close to the actual figure.
- The claim about the speaker's country is plausible but unverifiable without knowing the specific country.
- The claim about France is accurate.

Considering the overall context and the slight overstatement for Germany, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but not entirely precise.

"Natomiast od samego początku zarówno rząd Ewy Kopacz, jak i my wszyscy sprzeciwialiśmy się mechanizmom stałej relokacji.",false,pl,"However, from the very beginning, both Ewa Kopacz's government and all of us opposed the mechanisms of permanent relocation.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the stance of Ewa Kopacz's government regarding the mechanisms of permanent relocation, particularly in the context of the European Union's refugee and migrant crisis policies.

Ewa Kopacz served as the Prime Minister of Poland from September 2014 to November 2015. During her tenure, the European Union proposed a plan for the relocation of refugees among member states to address the influx of migrants, particularly from the Middle East and North Africa.

Kopacz's government initially showed some willingness to cooperate with the EU's relocation plan but expressed significant reservations about the idea of permanent relocation mechanisms. Poland, under her leadership, agreed to accept a limited number of refugees but opposed the idea of a mandatory and permanent quota system for relocating refugees across the EU.

Given this context, the claim that ""from the very beginning, both Ewa Kopacz's government and all of us opposed the mechanisms of permanent relocation"" is largely accurate. Kopacz's government did oppose the idea of permanent relocation mechanisms, although they did agree to some temporary measures.

"Jak wszyscy pamiętamy, prof.

The ""abortion compromise"" in Poland refers to the 1993 law that significantly restricted abortion but allowed it in three specific cases: when the pregnancy endangers the mother's life or health, when there is a high probability of severe and irreversible fetal impairment or an incurable illness threatening the fetus's life, and when the pregnancy results from a criminal act such as rape or incest.

Lech Kaczyński, as a member of the Law and Justice party (PiS), generally held conservative views on social issues, including abortion. However, he was known to support the existing compromise rather than pushing for a total ban on abortion, which some members of his party advocated for. His stance was seen as a middle ground, maintaining the restrictive law but not seeking to eliminate the exceptions provided by the 1993 compromise.

Given this context, the claim that Lech Kaczyński was a supporter of the abortion compromise is accurate.

Without specific details about the election, the parties involved, and the actions taken by other parties, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim.

How could we lose such a wonderful Polish invention?","To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the key points:

1. **Graphene as a Polish Invention**: Graphene is not a Polish invention. It was first isolated and characterized by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom in 2004. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their groundbreaking work on graphene.

2. **Production in the United Kingdom**: It is true that significant research and production of graphene have been taking place in the United Kingdom, particularly at the University of Manchester, where the material was first isolated.

Given these points, the claim that graphene is a Polish invention is incorrect, while the statement about its production in the United Kingdom is accurate.

1. **EU Coordination**: During the H1N1 pandemic, the European Union coordinated efforts to manage the outbreak, but vaccine procurement was primarily the responsibility of individual member states rather than a centralized EU effort.

2. **Vaccine Purchase**: Many EU countries did purchase vaccines for their populations, but the extent and coverage varied by country. Not all countries purchased enough vaccines for every single resident, and the distribution and administration of vaccines also varied.

3. **Coverage**: While some countries aimed to vaccinate a significant portion of their populations, logistical, financial, and policy differences meant that not every resident in every EU country received a vaccine.

Given these points, the claim that vaccines were purchased for all residents of the remaining EU countries is an overstatement. While efforts were made to procure vaccines, it was not uniformly for all residents across all countries.

The Polish Ministry of National Defence has announced plans to expand the armed forces, with a target of reaching 300,000 personnel, including 250,000 professional soldiers and 50,000 members of the Territorial Defence Forces, by 2035. However, as of now, the Polish Army has not yet reached the 200,000 mark.

Based on available information, the Independence March, organized by the Independence March Association, was indeed registered as a cyclical assembly in Poland. However, the specific registration status and the duration of this registration can vary and may not be publicly detailed for every year.

According to various reports and data from environmental agencies and governmental bodies, mining waste and coal combustion residues indeed make up a significant portion of industrial waste in Poland. Poland has a substantial coal industry, and the by-products of coal mining and combustion are major contributors to industrial waste.

However, the exact percentage can vary depending on the source and the year of the data. Some sources might report slightly different figures, but the general consensus is that these types of waste are a major component of Poland's industrial waste.

Given that the claim states a specific figure of 60%, and considering that this figure is within the range reported by various sources, but might not be exact, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but not definitively precise.

1. **Historical Context**: 
   - 20 years ago, the specific salaries were seven times the average salary.
   - This implies a significant disparity between the specific salaries and the average salary at that time.

2. **Current Context**:
   - Today, the same specific salaries are less than twice the average salary.

To verify this claim, we would need:
- Historical data on the specific salaries and the average salary from 20 years ago.
- Current data on the specific salaries and the average salary today.

Without concrete data, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim. If we assume the data provided is accurate, the claim logically follows that the relative difference between the specific salaries and the average salary has decreased over the past 20 years.

Today, due to the coronavirus epidemic, 59 people have already died and this number, unfortunately, will continue to grow - but the PiS leader ""sees no grounds"" for introducing a state of natural disaster.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. **Historical Context**: Whether Jarosław Kaczyński, when in opposition 10 years ago, considered the introduction of a state of natural disaster justified when 25 people died in a flood.
2. **Current Context**: Whether Jarosław Kaczyński, in the context of the coronavirus epidemic, stated that he sees no grounds for introducing a state of natural disaster despite 59 people having died.

**Verification:**

1. **Historical Context**: In 2010, Poland experienced severe flooding, and there were indeed discussions about the introduction of a state of natural disaster. Jarosław Kaczyński, then in opposition, did advocate for stronger measures, which could be interpreted as supporting the introduction of a state of natural disaster.

2. **Current Context**: During the coronavirus epidemic, Jarosław Kaczyński, as the leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, has publicly stated that he does not see grounds for introducing a state of natural disaster, despite the rising death toll.

Given these points, the claim appears to be accurate in both historical and current contexts.

The claim involves two main points:

1. The assertion that the DS (presumably a political party or group) tried to label the speaker with an ""urban legend.""
2. The speaker's claim of consistently staying true to themselves and not switching parties despite being in coalitions.

Without specific evidence or context about the speaker's political history, affiliations, and the actions of the DS, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the speaker is providing an honest account of their personal experience and political stance, we might lean towards a certain level of truthfulness.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to fully support or refute the claim, the most balanced assessment would be:

"Работа о коронавирусе, переносимом летучими мышами, реально выполнялась в Казахстане по заказу департамента обороны США",half true,ru,The work on coronavirus carried by bats was actually conducted in Kazakhstan at the request of the U.S. Department of Defense.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The work on coronavirus carried by bats was actually conducted in Kazakhstan at the request of the U.S. Department of Defense,"" we need to examine the available evidence and context.

1. **Research on Coronaviruses and Bats**: Research on coronaviruses, including those carried by bats, has been conducted in various countries around the world. This includes studies in China, the United States, and other nations. The focus of such research is often to understand the transmission and evolution of viruses to prevent future pandemics.

2. **U.S. Department of Defense Involvement**: The U.S. Department of Defense has funded various research projects related to infectious diseases, including those involving coronaviruses. However, the specific claim that the U.S. Department of Defense requested research on coronaviruses carried by bats to be conducted in Kazakhstan is not widely substantiated by credible sources.

3. **Kazakhstan's Role**: There is limited public information suggesting that Kazakhstan has been a central location for U.S.-funded research specifically on coronaviruses carried by bats. Most prominent research on this topic has been associated with other countries, particularly China.

Given the lack of substantial evidence supporting the specific claim about Kazakhstan and the U.S. Department of Defense, it is important to approach this claim with skepticism.

В Бельгии прошла ярмарка детей для однополых пар,false,ru,A children's fair for same-sex couples took place in Belgium.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A children's fair for same-sex couples took place in Belgium,"" we need to verify if such an event specifically targeted at same-sex couples and their children actually occurred in Belgium.

1. **Research**: Look for credible sources or news articles that report on a children's fair specifically organized for same-sex couples in Belgium.
2. **Context**: Understand the nature of the event, if it was indeed held, and whether it was explicitly for same-sex couples or inclusive of all families.

After conducting a search, if there is evidence from reliable sources confirming that such an event took place, the claim would be 'True'. If there is no evidence or if the event was not specifically for same-sex couples, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Małe i średnie przedsiębiorstwa wytwarzają 50 procent plus PKB polskiego.,false,pl,Small and medium-sized enterprises generate 50 percent or more of Poland's GDP.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Small and medium-sized enterprises generate 50 percent or more of Poland's GDP,"" we need to look at reliable sources and data on the contribution of SMEs to Poland's GDP.

According to various reports and data from organizations such as the European Commission and Poland's Central Statistical Office, SMEs play a significant role in the Polish economy. SMEs in Poland are known to contribute substantially to the GDP, employment, and overall economic activity.

For instance, the European Commission's annual report on European SMEs often highlights that SMEs in Poland contribute a significant portion of the GDP, typically around or slightly above 50%. This aligns with the general understanding that SMEs are a crucial part of the Polish economy.

Given this information, the claim that SMEs generate 50 percent or more of Poland's GDP is supported by available data and reports.

The late Lech Kaczyński did this by sending the law, which we (PO – note by Demagog) passed in the Sejm in 2008, to the Constitutional Tribunal, and he was assisted by Andrzej Duda, who wrote legal opinions.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **PiS Blocking Supervision of SKOKs**: The claim states that PiS (Law and Justice party) blocked the possibility of the KNF (Polish Financial Supervision Authority) taking over supervision of the credit unions (SKOKs).

2. **Lech Kaczyński's Role**: It asserts that the late Lech Kaczyński, who was the President of Poland at the time, sent the law passed by the Sejm in 2008 to the Constitutional Tribunal.

3. **Andrzej Duda's Involvement**: It also mentions that Andrzej Duda, who later became President of Poland, assisted by writing legal opinions.

### Verification:

1. **PiS Blocking Supervision**:
   - The Law and Justice party (PiS) was indeed opposed to the law that would place SKOKs under the supervision of the KNF.
   - The law was passed by the Sejm in 2008 when the Civic Platform (PO) was in power.

2. **Lech Kaczyński's Role**:
   - Lech Kaczyński, as President, did send the law to the Constitutional Tribunal for review, which delayed its implementation.

3. **Andrzej Duda's Involvement**:
   - Andrzej Duda, who was a legal advisor at the time, did write legal opinions related to this matter.

### Conclusion:
The claim accurately describes the actions taken by PiS, Lech Kaczyński, and Andrzej Duda regarding the supervision of SKOKs. The delay caused by sending the law to the Constitutional Tribunal aligns with the timeline mentioned.

1. **Current Status of Railway Construction**: The claim mentions that work is already underway on the section from Stara Pazova to Novi Sad and that the Belgrade-Stara Pazova section is starting. We need to check the latest updates on the construction progress of these railway sections.

2. **Travel Time**: The claim states that in a year and a half, the travel time from Belgrade to Novi Sad will be 40 minutes. This requires verification of the projected completion date and the expected travel time once the railway is operational.

3. **Comparison with Car Travel**: The claim suggests that traveling by train will be much better than by car. This can be assessed by comparing the projected train travel time with the current car travel time between Belgrade and Novi Sad.

### Verification:

1. **Construction Progress**:
   - As of the latest updates, the construction of the high-speed railway between Belgrade and Novi Sad is indeed underway. The section from Stara Pazova to Novi Sad has seen significant progress, and work on the Belgrade-Stara Pazova section has also commenced.

2. **Projected Travel Time**:
   - The high-speed railway is designed to reduce travel time significantly. The projected travel time of 40 minutes is consistent with the speeds expected from the new railway infrastructure.

3. **Comparison with Car Travel**:
   - Currently, the car travel time between Belgrade and Novi Sad is approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, depending on traffic conditions. A 40-minute train journey would indeed be faster and potentially more convenient, especially considering it is from city center to city center.

3. Poland's ranking in terms of forest cover within the European Union.

1. **Forest Cover in Poland**: According to various sources, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and national statistics, Poland's forest cover is approximately 30%.

2. **Average Forest Cover in the European Union**: The average forest cover in the European Union is around 38%, based on data from the European Environment Agency and other environmental reports.

3. **Poland's Ranking in the EU**: Poland is not at the bottom of the list but is indeed lower than the EU average.

Given this information:

- The forest cover in Poland is correctly stated as 30%.
- The average forest cover in the EU is correctly stated as 38%.
- The claim that Poland is at the bottom of the list and in 19th place is somewhat misleading. Poland is not at the very bottom but is in the lower half.

Poland was on the Golan Heights, we had several hundred of our soldiers who participated in the UN peacekeeping operation.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the historical involvement of Polish troops in the Golan Heights and their subsequent withdrawal.

1. **Polish Presence in the Golan Heights**: Poland did indeed participate in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan Heights. Polish troops were part of this peacekeeping mission, which was established in 1974 to monitor the ceasefire between Israel and Syria.

2. **Withdrawal of Polish Troops**: Poland withdrew its troops from the Golan Heights in 2009. This decision was made by the Polish government under the leadership of then-Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who served from 2007 to 2014. Therefore, the withdrawal was indeed carried out by one of the predecessors of the current leadership.

Пальмовое масло вызывает рак и делает мужчин стерильными,half true,ru,Palm oil causes cancer and makes men sterile.,"The claim that ""Palm oil causes cancer and makes men sterile"" is not supported by strong scientific evidence. 

1. **Cancer**: There is no conclusive evidence that palm oil directly causes cancer. Some studies have suggested that the consumption of palm oil, especially when it is not processed properly and contains high levels of certain contaminants like 3-MCPD esters and glycidyl esters, might increase the risk of cancer. However, these findings are not definitive, and more research is needed to establish a direct causal link.

2. **Male Sterility**: There is no substantial scientific evidence to support the claim that palm oil causes male sterility. While diet and nutrition can impact reproductive health, there is no specific research indicating that palm oil has a direct effect on male fertility.

Given the lack of strong, conclusive evidence for both parts of the claim, it is misleading to state that palm oil definitively causes cancer or male sterility.

The Civic Platform (PO) and the Polish People's Party (PSL) coalition governed Poland from 2007 to 2015. During this period, there were indeed some salary increases for teachers. For instance, in 2008, teachers received a raise of about 10%, and there were subsequent increases in the following years. Specifically, teachers received raises in 2009, 2010, and 2011. 

Given this information, the claim that teachers did not receive any raises at all during the time the Civic Platform and the Polish People's Party were in power is inaccurate.
