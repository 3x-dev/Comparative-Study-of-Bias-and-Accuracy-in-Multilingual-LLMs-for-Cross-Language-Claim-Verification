Le Nigeria dépense 7 fois moins en soins de santé par habitant que l'Afrique du Sud.,false,fr,Nigeria spends 7 times less on healthcare per capita than South Africa.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Nigeria spends 7 times less on healthcare per capita than South Africa,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on healthcare expenditure per capita for both countries.

According to the World Bank data for 2020:
- Nigeria's healthcare expenditure per capita was approximately $82.
- South Africa's healthcare expenditure per capita was approximately $526.

To find out how many times less Nigeria spends compared to South Africa, we can perform the following calculation:
\[ \frac{526}{82} \approx 6.41 \]

This means that Nigeria spends about 6.41 times less on healthcare per capita than South Africa, which is close to the claim of 7 times but not exactly 7 times.

Given this information, the claim is not entirely accurate but is close to the truth.

Le quart bloquant a été supprimé de la Constitution sénégalaise. Il n'existe plus depuis 2006.,true,fr,The blocking quarter was removed from the Senegalese Constitution. It has not existed since 2006.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the historical and constitutional context of Senegal. The ""blocking quarter"" refers to a constitutional mechanism that required a supermajority (often three-quarters) to pass certain legislative changes or decisions.

In Senegal, significant constitutional reforms took place in 2001, which included the introduction of a new constitution. However, the specific mechanism referred to as the ""blocking quarter"" was indeed removed in subsequent reforms. The most notable constitutional amendment that removed this mechanism occurred in 2006.

Given this context, the claim that ""The blocking quarter was removed from the Senegalese Constitution. It has not existed since 2006."" is accurate.

"«Fin quando siamo stati al governo noi, avevamo una disoccupazione inferiore di due punti alla media europea, oggi abbiano una disoccupazione superiore di due punti alla media europea. La disoccupazione giovanile è addirittura drammatica, al 32%; significa che 3 giovani su 10 non hanno un lavoro»",mostly true,it,"""As long as we were in government, we had an unemployment rate two points lower than the European average; today we have an unemployment rate two points higher than the European average. Youth unemployment is even dramatic, at 32%; this means that 3 out of 10 young people do not have a job.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Unemployment Rate Comparison**: The claim states that when the speaker's party was in government, the unemployment rate was two points lower than the European average, and now it is two points higher. This requires historical and current unemployment data for the country in question and the European average.

2. **Youth Unemployment Rate**: The claim mentions a youth unemployment rate of 32%, which translates to 3 out of 10 young people being unemployed. This needs to be checked against the latest available statistics.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the speaker is referring to a specific country and time period, we can make an educated guess based on general trends.

For example, if the country in question is Italy, historical data shows that Italy's unemployment rate has often been higher than the European average, and youth unemployment has been a significant issue. However, the exact figures can vary.

Given the need for precise data to confirm the exact numbers, and assuming the speaker's general point about higher unemployment rates and significant youth unemployment is based on observable trends, the claim could be considered:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Il surplus commerciale della Germania viola le regole europee?,true,it,Does Germany's trade surplus violate European rules?,"To determine whether Germany's trade surplus violates European rules, we need to examine the relevant regulations and guidelines set by the European Union (EU).

1. **EU Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP)**: The EU has a Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure that monitors and addresses potential economic imbalances within member states. One of the indicators under this procedure is the current account balance, which includes the trade surplus. The threshold for concern is a current account surplus of more than 6% of GDP over a three-year period.

2. **Germany's Trade Surplus**: Germany has consistently had a trade surplus that exceeds this 6% threshold. This has led to scrutiny and discussions within the EU about the potential imbalances it creates.

3. **Consequences and Actions**: While exceeding the threshold triggers a review and potential recommendations from the European Commission, it does not automatically constitute a violation of EU rules. The EU may suggest policy adjustments to address the imbalance, but there are no immediate penalties or legal violations associated with surpassing the threshold.

Given this context, the claim that Germany's trade surplus violates European rules is not entirely accurate. It may trigger reviews and recommendations, but it does not constitute a direct violation of EU regulations.

“La Argentina tiene recursos de gas no convencional que la ubica segunda en el ranking mundial después de China”,true,es,"""Argentina has unconventional gas resources that place it second in the world ranking after China.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Argentina has unconventional gas resources that place it second in the world ranking after China,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on global unconventional gas resources, specifically shale gas.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and other reputable sources, Argentina is indeed one of the top countries in terms of technically recoverable shale gas resources. The EIA's 2013 report on shale gas resources ranked Argentina second in the world, after China, in terms of technically recoverable shale gas resources.

However, it's important to note that rankings can change over time as new data becomes available and as other countries develop their resources. As of the latest available data, Argentina still holds a significant position in the global ranking for shale gas resources.

Given this context, the claim is largely accurate based on the most recent comprehensive assessments.

ONE is a well-known international organization that campaigns to end extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa. According to their reports and campaigns, they have indeed highlighted countries where girls face significant barriers to education.

In their 2017 report titled ""Poverty is Sexist,"" ONE identified the top 10 toughest countries for a girl to get an education. These countries are:
1. South Sudan
2. Central African Republic
3. Niger
4. Afghanistan

"“En Educación pasamos del 25% del total de presupuesto al 17%, 8 puntos. En Salud pasó algo similar, de 19% a 14%”",half true,es,"""In Education, we went from 25% of the total budget to 17%, a difference of 8 points. In Health, something similar happened, going from 19% to 14%.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific percentages mentioned for both Education and Health in the budget. The claim states that the budget for Education went from 25% to 17%, which is a difference of 8 percentage points. Similarly, it states that the budget for Health went from 19% to 14%, which is a difference of 5 percentage points.

Let's break down the claim:

1. Education: 
   - Initial percentage: 25%
   - Final percentage: 17%
   - Difference: 25% - 17% = 8 percentage points

2. Health:
   - Initial percentage: 19%
   - Final percentage: 14%
   - Difference: 19% - 14% = 5 percentage points

The claim correctly identifies the difference for Education as 8 percentage points. However, it states that something similar happened in Health, but the actual difference is 5 percentage points, not 8.

Given this analysis, the claim is partially accurate but not entirely correct.

[Houve] queda na mortalidade infantil,mostly true,pt,There was a decrease in infant mortality.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There was a decrease in infant mortality,"" we would need specific data or context regarding the time period, location, and other relevant factors. Without this information, it is not possible to definitively assess the claim.

However, if we consider general global trends, many countries have seen a decrease in infant mortality rates over recent decades due to improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and sanitation. 

Given this general trend, but without specific data to confirm the claim in a particular context, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
"«[L'Italia è il] primo Paese per quanto riguarda il numero dei caschi blu, l'ottavo contributore al mondo per quanto riguarda il budget [delle missioni di pace]»",mostly true,it,"'[Italy is the] leading country in terms of the number of blue helmets, the eighth largest contributor in the world in terms of the budget [for peace missions].'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether Italy is the leading country in terms of the number of blue helmets (UN peacekeepers).
2. Whether Italy is the eighth largest contributor in the world in terms of the budget for peace missions.

### Point 1: Leading Country in Terms of Blue Helmets
As of the latest data from the United Nations, the countries contributing the most troops to UN peacekeeping missions are typically nations like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Rwanda, India, and Pakistan. Italy is not usually listed among the top contributors in terms of personnel.

### Point 2: Eighth Largest Contributor to the Budget
According to the United Nations' financial contributions to peacekeeping operations, the largest contributors are generally the United States, China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and others. Italy is indeed one of the top contributors, but it is not necessarily the eighth largest. The exact ranking can vary slightly depending on the year and the specific financial data.

### Conclusion
Given that Italy is not the leading country in terms of the number of blue helmets and the claim about being the eighth largest contributor to the budget is somewhat accurate but not definitively so, the overall claim is not entirely accurate.

"“Sepan que cuando llegamos al Gobierno, las tarifas [de luz], una parte de la boleta se pagaba en dólares”",true,es,"""Know that when we came to the Government, the [electricity] rates, a part of the bill was paid in dollars.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and historical facts regarding electricity rates and billing practices in the relevant country and time period. 

1. Identify the country and the time period in question.
2. Research the electricity billing practices during that time, specifically whether any part of the bill was paid in dollars.
3. Compare the claim to the verified information.

Without specific details about the country and time period, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim refers to a situation where a government took over and changed the billing practices from a mixed currency system to a single currency system, we can make an educated guess.

For example, in some countries with unstable local currencies, utility bills might have been partially denominated in a more stable foreign currency (like the US dollar) to hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. If a new government came in and changed this practice, the claim could be accurate.

Given the general nature of the claim and the common practices in some countries, the claim could be considered plausible but requires specific verification.

The claim that soursop leaf tea does not bring any side effects and can be used as much as you want is not accurate. While soursop (Graviola) has been used in traditional medicine and may have some health benefits, it can also have side effects and potential risks, especially if consumed in large quantities or over a long period. Some studies have suggested that compounds in soursop may be neurotoxic and could potentially lead to conditions similar to Parkinson's disease. Therefore, it is important to use it with caution and consult with a healthcare professional before consuming it regularly.",false,True,False

This involves checking historical trade statistics for the country in question, which is not specified in the claim. 

However, without specific data or the country context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. Generally, such a significant shift from exporting to importing fuels would be notable and likely documented in trade reports or economic analyses.

Given the lack of specific data and context, the claim cannot be verified as entirely accurate or inaccurate. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization based on the information provided would be:

“La Argentina ya es uno de los países con mayor índice de pobreza de América Latina”,false,es,"""Argentina is already one of the countries with the highest poverty rate in Latin America.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Argentina is already one of the countries with the highest poverty rate in Latin America,"" we need to look at recent and reliable data on poverty rates in Latin American countries.

According to data from international organizations such as the World Bank, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), and national statistics agencies, Argentina has experienced significant economic challenges, including high inflation and economic instability, which have contributed to rising poverty rates. However, it is important to compare these rates with those of other Latin American countries.

As of the most recent data, countries like Venezuela, Honduras, and Guatemala have higher poverty rates compared to Argentina. While Argentina's poverty rate is indeed high and concerning, it is not necessarily the highest in the region.

Given this context, the claim that Argentina is ""one of the countries with the highest poverty rate in Latin America"" can be considered somewhat accurate but not entirely precise, as there are other countries with higher poverty rates.

Con questa legge l’Italia è già oggi il Paese che dà più cittadinanze a cittadini stranieri in tutta Europa,half true,it,"'With this law, Italy is already today the country that grants the most citizenships to foreign citizens in all of Europe.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Italy is already today the country that grants the most citizenships to foreign citizens in all of Europe,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on citizenship grants in European countries.

According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, the country that grants the most citizenships can vary from year to year. Historically, countries like Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom have also been among the top countries granting citizenships to foreign nationals.

For instance, in recent years, Italy has indeed been one of the leading countries in granting citizenships, but it is not consistently the top country every year. The numbers can fluctuate based on various factors, including changes in immigration policies, the number of applications, and processing times.

Given this context, the claim that Italy is ""the country that grants the most citizenships to foreign citizens in all of Europe"" is an overstatement. While Italy is among the top countries, it is not definitively the top country every year.

“Hoy tenemos la misma cantidad de obreros industriales que en los ‘90”,mostly true,es,"""Today we have the same number of industrial workers as in the '90s.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Today we have the same number of industrial workers as in the '90s,"" we need to examine historical and current data on industrial employment.

1. **Historical Context**: In the 1990s, the number of industrial workers in many developed countries, including the United States, was relatively high. However, the late 20th century and early 21st century saw significant changes due to globalization, automation, and shifts in economic focus from manufacturing to services.

2. **Current Data**: In recent years, many developed countries have experienced a decline in industrial employment due to increased automation, offshoring of manufacturing jobs, and a shift towards a service-based economy. For example, in the United States, the number of manufacturing jobs has generally decreased since the 1990s, despite some fluctuations and recent efforts to bring manufacturing back.

3. **Global Perspective**: While some countries, particularly in Asia, have seen an increase in industrial employment due to their growing manufacturing sectors, this does not necessarily mean that the global number of industrial workers has remained the same as in the 1990s.

Given these points, the claim that ""Today we have the same number of industrial workers as in the '90s"" is not supported by the general trend of declining industrial employment in many developed countries and the shift towards automation and services.

1. **Check Official Sources**: The official budget documents from the São Paulo city government or relevant financial reports would provide the most accurate figures.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Understand if the R$ 1.2 billion figure is for a specific year, a cumulative amount over several years, or an average annual budget.
3. **Recent Data**: Ensure the data is up-to-date, as budgets can change annually.

Without access to the specific and most recent budget documents, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent and accurate data, we can make an educated guess.

Given the complexity and size of São Paulo, a budget of R$ 1.2 billion for social assistance is plausible but needs verification.

«Il primo Presidente del Consiglio della storia a tagliarsi lo #stipendio. Orgogliosi di @GiuseppeConteIT!».,mostly true,it,"""The first Prime Minister in history to cut his salary. Proud of @GiuseppeConteIT!""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that Giuseppe Conte was the first Prime Minister in history to cut his salary, we need to consider historical records of other Prime Ministers and their actions regarding salary cuts.

1. **Historical Context**: There have been instances where other Prime Ministers or heads of government have taken salary cuts. For example, during times of economic crisis or austerity measures, some leaders have voluntarily reduced their salaries as a gesture of solidarity with the public.

2. **Specific Examples**: 
   - In 2011, the then-Prime Minister of Greece, George Papandreou, announced a salary cut for himself and his ministers during the Greek financial crisis.
   - In 2013, the Prime Minister of Ireland, Enda Kenny, took a pay cut as part of broader austerity measures.

Given these examples, it is clear that Giuseppe Conte was not the first Prime Minister in history to cut his salary.

"Neste ano [2018], registramos um saldo de 204 mil vagas com carteira assinada",true,pt,"'This year [2018], we recorded a balance of 204 thousand jobs with formal contracts.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the data regarding the number of jobs with formal contracts recorded in 2018. This information is typically available from official labor statistics or government reports.

In Brazil, for example, the Ministry of Economy provides data on formal employment through the General Register of Employed and Unemployed (CAGED). According to CAGED data, Brazil recorded a net creation of 529,554 formal jobs in 2018. This figure is significantly higher than the 204 thousand jobs mentioned in the claim.

Given this discrepancy, the claim that ""This year [2018], we recorded a balance of 204 thousand jobs with formal contracts"" does not align with the official data.

Giovani italiani in fuga: quanti e perché?,true,it,'Young Italians on the run: how many and why?',"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Young Italians on the run: how many and why?"", we need to consider several factors:

1. **Emigration Trends**: There has been a noticeable trend of young Italians leaving the country in recent years. This is often attributed to economic challenges, lack of job opportunities, and better prospects abroad.

2. **Statistical Data**: According to various reports and studies, including those from ISTAT (Italian National Institute of Statistics) and other research bodies, a significant number of young Italians have emigrated in search of better opportunities.

3. **Reasons for Leaving**: The reasons cited for this emigration include high unemployment rates, economic instability, and the search for better educational and professional opportunities abroad.

1. **Source of the Announcement**: The claim hinges on an unspecified announcement. Without knowing the nature of the announcement, it's difficult to assess its impact on computer prices.

2. **Market Data**: A 36% drop in computer prices is significant. Market data from reliable sources would be necessary to verify such a substantial change.

3. **Timing**: The phrase ""have already dropped"" implies a recent and rapid change. Market trends typically do not shift so dramatically in a short period without a major catalyst.

4. **Context**: Economic factors, supply chain issues, technological advancements, or major industry shifts could influence computer prices. The claim does not provide context for these factors.

Given the lack of specific details and verifiable data, the claim appears to be exaggerated or lacking sufficient evidence.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFRI) has made such a statement.
2. **Data Verification**: Look at the available data on malnutrition rates in Senegal over a relevant period to see if there has been a 50% reduction.

### Step 1: Source Verification
- The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFRI) is a credible organization that conducts research on food policies. If a director from IFRI has made this statement, it would likely be based on their research findings.

### Step 2: Data Verification
- According to various reports and data from organizations like UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank, Senegal has made significant progress in reducing malnutrition rates over the past few decades. However, the exact percentage reduction can vary depending on the specific metrics used (e.g., stunting, wasting, underweight).

### Conclusion
- If the statement is indeed from a credible source within IFRI and aligns with the general trend of significant reduction in malnutrition rates in Senegal, it can be considered accurate. However, without exact figures from the latest reports, it is challenging to confirm the precise 50% reduction.

Given the available information and the credibility of the source, the claim appears to be largely accurate but may not be precise to the exact percentage.

Le imprese italiane non sono «le più tassate al mondo»,half true,it,"Italian companies are not ""the most taxed in the world"".","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Italian companies are not 'the most taxed in the world',"" we need to consider the context of corporate tax rates and overall tax burden on businesses globally.

1. **Corporate Tax Rates**: Italy's corporate tax rate is not the highest in the world. As of recent data, Italy's corporate tax rate is around 24%, with an additional regional tax (IRAP) that can bring the total to approximately 27.9%. This is higher than some countries but lower than others. For example, the United States has a federal corporate tax rate of 21%, but state taxes can increase this. Countries like France and Germany also have comparable or higher effective tax rates when considering all levels of taxation.

2. **Overall Tax Burden**: The overall tax burden on businesses includes not just corporate income tax but also other taxes such as social security contributions, property taxes, and other levies. According to the World Bank's ""Paying Taxes"" report, which measures the total tax rate as a percentage of commercial profits, Italy is not at the top of the list. Countries like France, Belgium, and some Scandinavian countries often have higher overall tax burdens on businesses.

3. **Global Comparisons**: When comparing globally, there are countries with significantly higher corporate tax rates and overall tax burdens. For instance, the United Arab Emirates has a 55% corporate tax rate for oil companies, and some African countries have high rates for certain sectors.

Given this information, the claim that ""Italian companies are not 'the most taxed in the world'"" is accurate. While Italy has a relatively high tax burden, it is not the highest globally.

1. **Recycling Targets**: The European Union has indeed set recycling targets for member states. According to the EU Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2008/98/EC), the targets are:
   - By 2025, at least 55% of municipal waste should be recycled.
   - By 2030, at least 60% of municipal waste should be recycled.
   - By 2035, at least 65% of municipal waste should be recycled.

2. **Ban on Burning Recyclable Waste**: The EU has regulations that discourage the incineration of recyclable waste. The Waste Framework Directive emphasizes the waste hierarchy, which prioritizes recycling over incineration. However, there is no outright ban on burning recyclable waste, but member states are encouraged to minimize it.

Given this information, the claim that there are mandatory recycling targets of 65% by 2025 and 70% by 2030 is not accurate. The actual targets are lower and spread over a longer timeline. Additionally, while there is a strong emphasis on recycling over incineration, there is no explicit ban on burning recyclable waste.

1. **Mining Jobs in 2003**: According to historical data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of jobs in the mining sector in 2003 was approximately 488,000. This includes all mining-related jobs, such as oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, and nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying.

2. **Current Mining Jobs**: As of the latest data available from the BLS, the number of jobs in the mining sector is significantly lower than half a million. For example, in recent years, the number of mining jobs has been around 600,000 to 700,000, but this includes a broader definition of mining-related activities.

Given this information, the claim that mining jobs increased from 79,000 in 2003 to almost half a million today is not accurate. The initial figure of 79,000 is significantly lower than the actual number of mining jobs in 2003, and the current number of mining jobs is not ""almost half a million"" but rather higher.

2. **Chile**: The first case was reported on March 3, 2020. 80 days later would be May 22, 2020. According to data, Chile had approximately 61,857 confirmed cases around that date.

3. **Brazil**: The first case was reported on February 26, 2020. 80 days later would be May 16, 2020. According to data, Brazil had approximately 233,142 confirmed cases around that date.

Given these numbers, the claim is quite close to the actual figures but not exact. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but is very close.

L’Algeria ci ruba il mare di fronte alla Sardegna?,mostly true,it,Is Algeria stealing the sea in front of Sardinia from us?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Algeria is stealing the sea in front of Sardinia from us,"" we need to consider the context of maritime boundaries and international law.

1. **Maritime Boundaries**: Maritime boundaries between countries are typically established through international agreements and treaties, often guided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). These boundaries determine the extent of a country's territorial waters, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and continental shelves.

2. **Recent Developments**: There have been reports and discussions about Algeria unilaterally extending its EEZ in the Mediterranean Sea, which could potentially overlap with the maritime zones claimed by Italy, particularly around Sardinia. However, such actions are subject to international negotiations and dispute resolution mechanisms.

3. **Diplomatic Actions**: If Algeria has indeed extended its EEZ in a way that overlaps with Italy's claims, it would not necessarily constitute ""stealing"" but rather a dispute over maritime boundaries. Such disputes are typically resolved through diplomatic channels, negotiations, or international arbitration.

Given the complexity of maritime boundary disputes and the need for diplomatic resolution, the claim that Algeria is ""stealing"" the sea is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

1. **Source of the Claim**: Verify if the claim is based on official government estimates, independent studies, or speculative figures.
2. **Context and Details**: Understand the context in which the claim was made, including the specific policies proposed by the Pd and M5Stelle government and the breakdown of the costs involved.
3. **Comparison with Other Estimates**: Compare the figure with other estimates or similar regularization programs in other countries to see if it aligns with typical costs.

Without specific details and context, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on some form of official or semi-official estimate, we can evaluate its plausibility.

Given the complexity and variability of such estimates, the claim could be considered an oversimplification or an approximation. Therefore, it might not be entirely accurate but could have some basis in reality.

"« Depuis 2016, le Sénégal a gagné 26 places dans le classement international Doing Business »",false,fr,"""Since 2016, Senegal has gained 26 places in the international Doing Business ranking.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Since 2016, Senegal has gained 26 places in the international Doing Business ranking,"" we need to examine the data from the World Bank's Doing Business reports from 2016 onwards.

1. **Doing Business 2016 Report**: Senegal was ranked 153rd.
2. **Doing Business 2020 Report**: Senegal was ranked 123rd.

Nós só temos cinco consulados lá [nos Estados Unidos],half true,pt,We only have five consulates there [in the United States].,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We only have five consulates there [in the United States],"" we need to verify the number of consulates that a specific country has in the United States. 

Consulates are diplomatic missions that provide various services to their citizens and facilitate diplomatic relations. The number of consulates a country has in the United States can vary widely depending on the country in question.

For example, if the country in question is a smaller nation with limited diplomatic presence, it might indeed have only five or fewer consulates in the United States. However, larger countries with extensive diplomatic networks, such as China, India, or Mexico, typically have more than five consulates spread across major U.S. cities.

Without specifying the country, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the general knowledge that many countries have more than five consulates in the U.S., the claim is likely to be inaccurate for most larger countries.

[La minor spesa per il reddito di cittadinanza] non è deficit. Questo dimostra proprio che non è deficit come si diceva,false,it,'[The lower expenditure for the citizenship income] is not a deficit. This precisely shows that it is not a deficit as was being said.',"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the statement in the context of budgetary and economic principles.

The claim states that lower expenditure for the citizenship income is not a deficit and uses this lower expenditure as evidence that it is not a deficit. 

1. **Deficit Definition**: A deficit occurs when expenditures exceed revenues. It is a measure of financial health in which the government, organization, or individual spends more than it earns or receives.

2. **Lower Expenditure**: Lower expenditure on a specific program, such as citizenship income, means that less money is being spent on that program than initially planned or budgeted.

3. **Implication**: The statement implies that because the expenditure is lower, it does not contribute to a deficit. However, this is not necessarily true. A deficit is determined by the overall balance of all revenues and expenditures, not just one program. Lower expenditure on one program could reduce the overall deficit, but it does not automatically mean there is no deficit.

Given this analysis, the claim oversimplifies the relationship between lower expenditure on a specific program and the overall budget deficit. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
“[Tuvo] la inflación más alta de los últimos 25 años”,true,es,"""[It had] the highest inflation in the last 25 years.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""[It had] the highest inflation in the last 25 years,"" we need to consider the specific context and data regarding inflation rates over the past 25 years. This involves looking at historical inflation data for the relevant country or region in question.

1. Identify the country or region being referred to.
2. Obtain historical inflation data for the past 25 years for that country or region.
3. Compare the current inflation rate to the highest inflation rates recorded in the past 25 years.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the claim is about a well-documented country like the United States, we can refer to publicly available data from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

For example, if the claim is about the United States:
- The highest inflation rate in recent history was in the early 1980s, but that is beyond the 25-year window.
- If we look at the period from 1998 to 2023, we can compare the annual inflation rates.

Assuming the claim is made in 2023, we would need to check if the inflation rate in 2023 is indeed the highest compared to any year from 1998 to 2022.

If the data shows that the inflation rate in 2023 is higher than any other year within the 25-year period, the claim would be 'True'. If it is close but not the highest, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If it is significantly lower, it would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the recent trends and assuming the claim is about the United States, where inflation rates have surged in 2022 and 2023 due to various economic factors, it is plausible that the claim could be accurate.

"Le Sénégal, premier prodcteur de sel, d'Afrique de l'*Ouest, importe pourtant le quart de sa consommation.",mostly true,fr,"Senegal, the leading salt producer in West Africa, nevertheless imports a quarter of its consumption.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether Senegal is indeed the leading salt producer in West Africa.
2. Whether Senegal imports a quarter of its salt consumption.

1. **Senegal as the Leading Salt Producer in West Africa:**
   - Senegal is known for its significant salt production, particularly from the Lac Rose (Pink Lake) area. It is one of the major salt producers in West Africa, but whether it is the absolute leading producer can vary based on the latest data and comparison with other countries like Ghana and Nigeria.

2. **Senegal Importing a Quarter of Its Salt Consumption:**
   - Despite its substantial production, Senegal does import salt. The exact proportion of imports relative to consumption would need to be verified through trade and consumption statistics.

Given the information available, it is reasonable to conclude that Senegal is a major salt producer in West Africa, and it does import a portion of its salt. However, without precise data confirming it imports exactly a quarter of its consumption, the claim might not be entirely accurate.

Un Nigerian sur cinq souffre de dépression à long terme.,false,fr,One in five Nigerians suffers from long-term depression.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""One in five Nigerians suffers from long-term depression,"" we need to look at available data and research on the prevalence of depression in Nigeria.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other mental health studies, the prevalence of depression in Nigeria is significant, but specific figures can vary. Some studies suggest that the prevalence of depression in Nigeria is around 3-5%, while others indicate higher rates, especially when considering broader definitions of depressive disorders.

However, the claim that ""one in five"" Nigerians (which translates to 20%) suffers from long-term depression seems to be an overestimation based on the available data. Most credible sources do not support such a high prevalence rate.

«[Il ministro dell’Economia e delle Finanze Roberto Gualtieri] ha appena annunciato che se sei in arretrato con i pagamenti ti possono pignorare i conti.

In my opinion, we are at a fiscal Soviet Union because we are in a fiscal police state.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement into its key components and verify each part:

1. **Announcement by Roberto Gualtieri**: We need to verify if Roberto Gualtieri, the Minister of Economy and Finance, made an announcement regarding the seizure of accounts for those behind on payments.
2. **Seizure of Accounts**: We need to confirm if there is a policy or law that allows the government to seize accounts of individuals who are behind on payments.
3. **Comparison to a Fiscal Soviet Union and Fiscal Police State**: This part of the statement is more subjective and opinion-based, comparing the policy to a ""fiscal Soviet Union"" and a ""fiscal police state.""

### Verification:

1. **Announcement by Roberto Gualtieri**:
   - If there is a public record or credible source confirming that Roberto Gualtieri made such an announcement, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Seizure of Accounts**:
   - Many countries have laws that allow the government to seize bank accounts or assets if individuals are significantly behind on tax payments or other financial obligations. This is a common practice in many legal systems to ensure compliance with tax laws.

3. **Comparison to a Fiscal Soviet Union and Fiscal Police State**:
   - This is a subjective opinion. The terms ""fiscal Soviet Union"" and ""fiscal police state"" are used to evoke a sense of extreme government control and lack of personal financial freedom. Whether this comparison is accurate depends on one's perspective and interpretation of the government's actions.

### Conclusion:

- If Roberto Gualtieri did indeed announce a policy allowing the seizure of accounts for those behind on payments, the factual part of the claim is true.
- The comparison to a ""fiscal Soviet Union"" and ""fiscal police state"" is an opinion and not a factual statement.

Given that the factual part of the claim can be verified and the comparison is subjective, the overall claim can be considered as having a basis in truth but is heavily opinionated.

"Le Nigéria, premier producteur de bébés infectés par le VIH",true,fr,"Nigeria, the leading producer of babies infected with HIV.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Nigeria is the leading producer of babies infected with HIV,"" we need to examine available data and reports from credible sources such as UNAIDS, WHO, and other relevant health organizations.

According to UNAIDS and other health organizations, Nigeria has one of the highest rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in the world. The country has a significant number of children born with HIV due to various factors, including limited access to prenatal care and antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women.

However, the term ""leading producer"" can be somewhat ambiguous. While Nigeria is indeed one of the countries with the highest number of babies born with HIV, it is important to note that other countries also have high rates of mother-to-child transmission. The specific ranking can vary depending on the metrics used and the year of the data.

Given this context, the claim is largely accurate but may lack some nuance.

1. **Dublin Regulation**: This is a European Union (EU) law that determines which EU member state is responsible for examining an application for asylum seekers. The regulation generally stipulates that the first country of entry is responsible for processing asylum claims.

2. **Penalizing for Italy**: This part of the claim suggests that the Dublin Regulation disproportionately affects Italy because it is often the first point of entry for many migrants entering the EU.

3. **Not being abolished but remains in force**: This indicates that the Dublin Regulation is still active and has not been repealed.

4. **Principle of reception for the countries of first entry remains intact**: This means that the rule that the first country of entry is responsible for asylum seekers is still in place.

5. **Causing serious prejudice to Italy**: This suggests that the regulation has negative consequences for Italy.

Based on the current status of the Dublin Regulation as of the knowledge cutoff in 2023:

- The Dublin Regulation is indeed still in force and has not been abolished.
- The principle that the first country of entry is responsible for processing asylum claims remains a core part of the regulation.
- Italy, being a primary entry point for many migrants, does face significant challenges and burdens due to this regulation.

Given these points, the claim accurately reflects the current situation regarding the Dublin Regulation and its impact on Italy.

Les femmes portent l’ADN masculin de tous ceux avec qui elles ont eu des rapports intimes,false,fr,Women carry the male DNA of all those with whom they have had intimate relations.,"The claim that ""Women carry the male DNA of all those with whom they have had intimate relations"" is not supported by scientific evidence. The idea seems to stem from misunderstandings or misinterpretations of scientific studies. 

One study that is often misrepresented in this context is research on microchimerism, where cells from a fetus can remain in a woman's body for years after pregnancy. However, this is not related to intimate relations but rather to pregnancy. There is no scientific basis for the claim that male DNA from all intimate partners is retained in a woman's body.

1. **Subsidies allocated to 100 daaras**: This would involve checking government records or reports that confirm the allocation of subsidies to 100 daaras during the specified period.
2. **64 modern daaras established**: This would require evidence or documentation showing the establishment of 64 modern daaras.
3. **Legal framework**: This would involve verifying the existence of a legal framework that was put in place during the specified period.

Without access to the specific documents or independent verification sources, it is challenging to definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume the government of Senegal's white paper is a reliable source, the claim could be considered accurate.

As of the latest available data:

- Chile's GDP per capita is approximately $15,000 to $16,000.

Davvero alla Camera bar e ristoranti non accettano il bancomat?,half true,it,'Is it really true that bars and restaurants in the Chamber do not accept debit cards?',"To determine the accuracy of the claim that bars and restaurants in the Chamber do not accept debit cards, we need to consider the specific context and location referred to by ""the Chamber."" If ""the Chamber"" refers to a specific legislative body or institution, such as the UK Parliament or another governmental body, the payment policies of their internal bars and restaurants would need to be verified.

For example, in the UK Parliament, there have been reports and instances where certain bars and restaurants within the parliamentary estate did not accept debit cards, relying instead on cash or other forms of payment. However, this policy can change over time, and more recent updates might allow for debit card payments.

Without specific and up-to-date information about the current policies of the bars and restaurants in the Chamber being referred to, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on historical context and known instances, the claim has some basis in reality but may not be universally true at all times or in all places.

Quanto spendono Italia ed Europa per l’immigrazione,mostly true,it,How much do Italy and Europe spend on immigration?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim regarding how much Italy and Europe spend on immigration, we need to consider the available data and context. 

1. **Italy's Spending on Immigration**: Italy's spending on immigration includes costs related to border control, asylum processing, integration programs, and support for refugees and migrants. According to various reports, Italy has spent billions of euros on managing immigration, especially during peak periods of migrant arrivals.

2. **Europe's Spending on Immigration**: The European Union (EU) allocates funds for immigration through various programs and funds, such as the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security Fund (ISF). The EU budget for 2021-2027 includes significant allocations for managing migration, border control, and integration efforts.

Given the complexity and variability of these expenditures, the claim's accuracy depends on the specific figures and context provided. Without precise numbers or a clear context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if the claim broadly states that Italy and Europe spend substantial amounts on immigration, it is generally supported by available data.

1. **Baseline Data**: The number of Civil Police officers in the state before the increase.
2. **Current Data**: The number of Civil Police officers in the state after the increase.
3. **Calculation**: The percentage increase from the baseline to the current data.

If the increase is indeed 53%, the claim would be 'True'. If the increase is close to 53% but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the increase is significantly different but still shows a substantial increase, it could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'. If there is no increase or the increase is minimal, the claim would be 'False'.

Without specific data to verify these points, we cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the data provided by the claimant is accurate and verifiable, we can tentatively categorize it.

1. **Marine Le Pen's Actions**: In December 2015, Marine Le Pen, leader of the French far-right party National Rally (formerly National Front), posted graphic images of ISIS executions on Twitter. This was in response to a journalist comparing her party to ISIS.

2. **European Parliament's Response**: In March 2017, the European Parliament voted to lift Marine Le Pen's parliamentary immunity. This action allowed French prosecutors to pursue legal action against her for the dissemination of violent images, which is a criminal offense under French law.

3. **Legal Proceedings**: The removal of immunity was specifically related to the legal proceedings in France concerning the publication of the violent images. It was not a judgment of guilt by the European Parliament but rather a procedural step to allow French authorities to investigate and potentially prosecute.

Given these points, the claim that the European Parliament removed Marine Le Pen's immunity because she was ""guilty"" of publishing ISIS beheadings is misleading. The European Parliament's action was to lift her immunity to allow for legal proceedings, not to declare her guilt.

1. **Number of Single Mothers**: The claim states there are 900,000 single mothers in the country. This figure needs to be checked against reliable demographic data.

2. **Risk of Poverty**: The claim asserts that half of these single mothers are at risk of poverty. This requires verification from sources such as government statistics or reputable studies on poverty rates among single mothers.

3. **Comparison with Other Mothers**: The claim suggests that single mothers are certainly more in difficulty than other mothers. This can be evaluated by comparing socioeconomic indicators such as income, employment, and access to resources between single mothers and mothers in other family structures.

Without specific data from the country in question, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general trends observed in many countries, single mothers often face higher risks of poverty and more significant challenges compared to mothers in two-parent households.

Given the general trends and assuming the figures are reasonably accurate, the claim seems to be largely supported by common socioeconomic patterns.

The claim that sanitizing a car key with 70% gel or liquid alcohol can cause a fire when placed in the vehicle's ignition is not supported by scientific evidence. Alcohol-based sanitizers evaporate quickly and are unlikely to leave enough residue to cause a fire. Additionally, modern car ignitions are designed to prevent such sparks from causing fires.

Somos a terceira capital melhor avaliada [no Ideb],false,pt,We are the third highest-rated capital [in the Ideb].,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are the third highest-rated capital [in the Ideb],"" we need to verify the Ideb (Index of Basic Education Development) rankings for capital cities. The Ideb is a Brazilian index that measures the quality of education in public schools.

1. **Identify the Source**: Check the latest Ideb report or official data from the Brazilian Ministry of Education.
2. **Verify the Ranking**: Look specifically at the rankings for capital cities in the Ideb report.
3. **Confirm the Position**: Ensure that the city in question is indeed ranked third among all capital cities.

Without access to the latest Ideb data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if the data confirms that the city is ranked third among capital cities, the claim would be 'True'. If it is not ranked third, the claim would be 'False'. If it is close but not exactly third, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

Given the need for specific data verification, I will provide a general approach:

1. **If the city is ranked third**: The claim is 'True'.
2. **If the city is ranked close to third (e.g., second or fourth)**: The claim is 'Mostly True'.
3. **If the city is ranked within the top five but not third**: The claim is 'Half True'.

This involves understanding what specific information Matteo Salvini, an Italian politician, has or has not communicated regarding COVID-19 testing in the Lombardy and Veneto regions.

1. **Context**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lombardy and Veneto were two of the most affected regions in Italy. The approach to testing and managing the pandemic varied between these regions, with Veneto being noted for its extensive testing and contact tracing efforts compared to Lombardy.

2. **Salvini's Statements**: Matteo Salvini, as a prominent political figure, has made various public statements about the handling of the pandemic. If he has omitted significant details about the testing strategies or results in these regions, it could be relevant to the claim.

3. **Verification**: To verify the claim, we would need to cross-reference Salvini's public statements with factual data on testing in Lombardy and Veneto. This includes looking at official health reports, news articles, and public records.

Without specific details on what Salvini has or hasn't said, and without concrete evidence to support the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if the claim suggests that Salvini has omitted critical information about the testing efforts in these regions, and if there is evidence to support this omission, the claim could be considered accurate to some degree.

"I giovani muoiono soprattuto per incidenti stradali, ma sempre meno",true,it,"Young people die mostly due to road accidents, but less and less.","To evaluate the claim ""Young people die mostly due to road accidents, but less and less,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Young people die mostly due to road accidents.""
2. ""But less and less.""

### Part 1: ""Young people die mostly due to road accidents.""
- Road accidents are indeed a significant cause of death among young people globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 years.
- However, whether road accidents are the ""most"" common cause of death can vary by region and other factors. In some areas, other causes like violence, suicide, or health conditions might be more prevalent.

### Part 2: ""But less and less.""
- Over recent years, many countries have implemented stricter road safety measures, improved vehicle safety standards, and increased public awareness, which have contributed to a decline in road traffic fatalities.
- Data from various sources, including the WHO and national traffic safety agencies, indicate a general trend of decreasing road traffic deaths in many parts of the world, although this trend is not uniform across all regions.

### Conclusion:
- The first part of the claim is generally accurate but may not be universally true in all contexts.
- The second part of the claim is supported by data showing a general decline in road traffic fatalities.

Given this analysis, the claim is not entirely accurate but has elements of truth.

"Les héritiers de Léopold Sédar Senghor perçoivent, par an, plus d'un milliard FCFA au titre des droits d'auteur de l’hymne national du Sénégal.",half true,fr,"The heirs of Léopold Sédar Senghor receive, per year, more than one billion CFA francs in royalties for the national anthem of Senegal.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The heirs of Léopold Sédar Senghor receive, per year, more than one billion CFA francs in royalties for the national anthem of Senegal,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Authorship of the National Anthem**: Léopold Sédar Senghor, a prominent Senegalese poet, politician, and cultural theorist, is indeed credited with writing the lyrics of the Senegalese national anthem, ""Pincez Tous vos Koras, Frappez les Balafons.""

2. **Royalty Payments for National Anthems**: It is uncommon for national anthems to generate significant royalties, especially in the range of one billion CFA francs (approximately 1.8 million USD). National anthems are typically considered public domain or are used in a manner that does not generate substantial royalties.

3. **Verification of the Claim**: There is no publicly available evidence or credible sources that confirm the heirs of Léopold Sédar Senghor receive such a large sum in royalties for the national anthem. This claim appears to be highly unlikely given the nature of national anthems and their typical usage.

Based on the above points, the claim seems highly improbable and lacks supporting evidence.

Dove si vota a 16 anni nel mondo?,true,it,Where can you vote at 16 years old in the world?,"The claim that you can vote at 16 years old in some places in the world is 'True'. There are several countries and regions where the voting age is set at 16 for certain types of elections. For example:

1. **Austria**: Allows voting at 16 for all elections.
2. **Brazil**: Allows voting at 16 for all elections.
3. **Argentina**: Allows voting at 16 for national elections.
4. **Scotland**: Allows voting at 16 for Scottish Parliament and local elections.
5. **Malta**: Allows voting at 16 for all elections.
6. **Ecuador**: Allows voting at 16 for all elections.
7. **Nicaragua**: Allows voting at 16 for all elections.
8. **Cuba**: Allows voting at 16 for all elections.

These examples demonstrate that there are indeed places around the world where individuals can vote at the age of 16.

Without access to specific data, I cannot definitively verify the numbers provided in the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, the increase from 200 to approximately 1500 would represent a significant growth in the number of collective labor agreements over the specified period.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if we were to assume the claim is based on accurate and reliable data, it could be considered 'True'. Conversely, if the data is not accurate, the claim could be 'False'.

Final Answer: Without specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I cannot provide a final answer.",,False,True
É um dos hits maiores da banda de Salford (Manchester) mas trata-se d......,false,pt,It is one of the biggest hits of the band from Salford (Manchester) but it is about d......,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to identify the band from Salford (Manchester) and one of their biggest hits that is about a topic starting with the letter 'd'.

One prominent band from Salford is Joy Division. One of their biggest hits is ""Love Will Tear Us Apart."" However, this song is not about a topic starting with 'd'.

Another band from Manchester is The Smiths, but they are not specifically from Salford.

Given this information, the claim does not seem to align with the known facts about prominent bands from Salford and their biggest hits.

"“Hay 800 mil pensiones por invalidez de más. Son más que los muertos de Estados Unidos, Reino Unido, Francia, Polonia, Grecia y los Países Bajos juntos en la Segunda Guerra Mundial”",false,es,"""There are 800,000 excess disability pensions. That is more than the combined number of deaths in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Poland, Greece, and the Netherlands during World War II.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two main points: the number of excess disability pensions and the combined number of deaths in the specified countries during World War II.

1. **Excess Disability Pensions**: The claim states there are 800,000 excess disability pensions. This figure would need to be verified through reliable sources such as government reports or reputable studies. Without specific context or data, it's challenging to confirm this number.

2. **Combined Deaths During World War II**:
   - **United States**: Approximately 418,500 military and civilian deaths.
   - **United Kingdom**: Approximately 450,700 military and civilian deaths.
   - **France**: Approximately 567,600 military and civilian deaths.
   - **Poland**: Approximately 5,600,000 military and civilian deaths.
   - **Greece**: Approximately 300,000 military and civilian deaths.
   - **Netherlands**: Approximately 301,000 military and civilian deaths.

Adding these figures together:
418,500 (US) + 450,700 (UK) + 567,600 (France) + 5,600,000 (Poland) + 300,000 (Greece) + 301,000 (Netherlands) = 7,637,800 deaths.

The claim compares 800,000 excess disability pensions to 7,637,800 deaths, which is significantly higher. Therefore, the claim that 800,000 is more than the combined number of deaths in these countries during World War II is incorrect.

L’Italia “Equatoriale” e l’eterno dibattito sul bicameralismo perfetto,half true,it,"Italy ""Equatorial"" and the eternal debate on perfect bicameralism.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Italy 'Equatorial' and the eternal debate on perfect bicameralism,"" let's break it down into its components:

1. **Italy ""Equatorial""**: This part of the claim is ambiguous and seems to be incorrect. Italy is a European country located in the southern part of Europe, not near the equator. The term ""Equatorial"" does not apply to Italy in any geographical or political context.

2. **Eternal debate on perfect bicameralism**: This part of the claim has some validity. Italy has a bicameral parliamentary system, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The debate over the effectiveness and efficiency of this system, often referred to as ""perfect bicameralism"" because both houses have equal powers, has been ongoing for many years. There have been numerous discussions and attempts at reforming this system to address issues such as legislative gridlock and inefficiency.

Given the analysis, the claim is a mix of incorrect and partially correct information.

“Desde agosto para acá hemos creado 82 mil nuevos puestos de trabajo formales”,mostly true,es,"""Since August, we have created 82,000 new formal jobs.""","To accurately determine the truthfulness of the claim ""Since August, we have created 82,000 new formal jobs,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. The specific time frame mentioned (since August).
2. The source of the job creation data.
3. The definition of ""formal jobs"" as used in the claim.
4. The context in which the claim was made (e.g., country, industry).

Without access to the specific data and context, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on official labor statistics or a credible source, we can make an educated guess.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate response would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"“Claramente hubo en las PASO un fraude muy, muy grande”",false,es,"""Clearly there was a very, very large fraud in the primaries.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Clearly there was a very, very large fraud in the primaries,"" we need to consider the available evidence and context. 

1. **Evidence of Fraud**: There have been numerous investigations and audits into primary elections, particularly in recent years. Most of these investigations have found very little evidence of widespread fraud. For example, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have both stated that the 2020 elections were secure and that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud.

2. **Expert Opinions**: Election experts and officials across the political spectrum have consistently reported that while there may be isolated incidents of irregularities or fraud, these are not significant enough to affect the overall outcome of the primaries.

3. **Legal Outcomes**: Many claims of large-scale fraud have been brought to court, and the vast majority have been dismissed due to lack of evidence. Courts have generally found that the claims do not hold up under scrutiny.

Given the lack of substantial evidence supporting the claim of a ""very, very large fraud"" in the primaries, and the consensus among experts and legal authorities that such fraud is not a significant issue, the claim does not hold up to factual scrutiny.

Per l’undicesimo mese consecutivo l’attività manifatturiera italiana è in contrazione.,false,it,"For the eleventh consecutive month, Italian manufacturing activity is in contraction.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""For the eleventh consecutive month, Italian manufacturing activity is in contraction,"" we need to verify the latest data on Italian manufacturing activity. This information is typically reported in the form of the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, where a PMI below 50 indicates contraction.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, I do not have access to real-time data. However, if the most recent PMI reports for Italy consistently show a value below 50 for the past eleven months, then the claim would be accurate.

Given the lack of real-time data verification, I cannot definitively confirm the claim. Therefore, based on the information available up to my last update, I cannot provide a final answer.

"Há mais ou menos dois meses, falei em entrevista que já teria tirado o Brasil do conselho [de Direitos Humanos] da ONU (...). Este atual apoio a um corrupto condenado e preso é só mais um exemplo da nossa posição",mostly true,pt,"About two months ago, I said in an interview that I would have already removed Brazil from the UN Human Rights Council (...). This current support for a convicted and imprisoned corrupt individual is just another example of our position.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the speaker indeed said in an interview about two months ago that they would have removed Brazil from the UN Human Rights Council.
2. Whether there is current support for a convicted and imprisoned corrupt individual by the UN Human Rights Council.

Without specific details or sources to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure and typical fact-checking standards, we can make an educated assessment.

1. **Interview Claim**: If the speaker did indeed make such a statement in an interview, this part of the claim could be verified by checking the interview records from two months ago.
2. **Support for a Convicted Individual**: This part of the claim would require evidence that the UN Human Rights Council is currently supporting a convicted and imprisoned corrupt individual, which is a serious accusation and would need substantial proof.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim and the need for verification of both points, the claim appears to be speculative and lacks concrete evidence.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
In Italia i profughi veri arrivano in aereo,false,it,"In Italy, real refugees arrive by plane.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In Italy, real refugees arrive by plane,"" we need to consider the various ways refugees enter Italy and the broader context of refugee movements.

1. **Arrival Methods**: Refugees and asylum seekers arrive in Italy through multiple routes, including by sea, land, and air. The Mediterranean Sea route is particularly well-documented, with many refugees and migrants arriving by boat, often in dangerous conditions. This route has been a significant focus of international attention due to the humanitarian crises associated with it.

2. **Air Travel**: While some refugees may arrive by plane, this is generally less common due to the stringent visa requirements and the financial and logistical barriers that many refugees face. Air travel is typically more accessible to those who have the necessary documentation and financial means, which many refugees lack.

3. **Legal and Humanitarian Context**: The term ""real refugees"" is subjective and problematic. Refugee status is determined based on international law, specifically the 1951 Refugee Convention, which defines a refugee as someone who has fled their country due to a well-founded fear of persecution. The mode of arrival does not determine the legitimacy of their refugee status.

Given this context, the claim oversimplifies and misrepresents the complex reality of refugee movements to Italy.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
durante el paro del campo “hubo varias víctimas fatales”,false,es,"During the farm strike ""there were several fatalities.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""there were several fatalities"" during the farm strike, we need to consider historical records and reliable sources that document the events of the farm strike in question. 

If the farm strike being referred to is the 1933-1934 farm strikes in the United States, historical records indicate that there were indeed violent confrontations and at least one documented fatality. For example, during the 1933 Farmers' Holiday Association strike, a farmer named John M. Holmes was killed in a confrontation with law enforcement in Le Mars, Iowa.

Given this information, the claim that ""there were several fatalities"" can be considered somewhat exaggerated if we are strictly referring to the documented events of the 1933-1934 farm strikes, where there was at least one known fatality but not necessarily ""several.""

45% des femmes nigeriannes se marient avant l'âge de 18 ans.,mostly true,fr,45% of Nigerian women get married before the age of 18.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""45% of Nigerian women get married before the age of 18,"" we need to refer to reliable sources such as reports from international organizations, government statistics, or reputable research studies.

According to UNICEF and other reputable sources, Nigeria has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. However, the specific percentage can vary depending on the source and the year of the data. As of recent reports, the percentage of Nigerian women who are married before the age of 18 is estimated to be around 43% to 44%.

Given this information, the claim that ""45% of Nigerian women get married before the age of 18"" is very close to the reported figures but slightly higher.

"La Côte d'Ivoire, première économie de l'UEMOA et membre du top10 mondial de la croissance économique, a dit son Premier ministre.",true,fr,"Ivory Coast, the leading economy of the WAEMU and a member of the global top 10 in economic growth, said its Prime Minister.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. **Ivory Coast as the leading economy of the WAEMU (West African Economic and Monetary Union):**
   - Ivory Coast is indeed one of the largest and most significant economies within the WAEMU. It has a substantial GDP and plays a crucial role in the economic activities of the region.

2. **Ivory Coast being a member of the global top 10 in economic growth:**
   - While Ivory Coast has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, it is not typically listed among the top 10 countries globally in terms of economic growth rates. The top 10 in economic growth often includes countries with exceptionally high growth rates, which can vary year by year.

Given these points, the claim that Ivory Coast is the leading economy of the WAEMU is accurate, but the assertion that it is a member of the global top 10 in economic growth is an exaggeration.

Il Parlamento Europeo e i foreign fighters,false,it,'The European Parliament and the foreign fighters'.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The European Parliament and the foreign fighters,"" we need to consider the context and the specifics of the claim. The European Parliament has indeed addressed the issue of foreign fighters, particularly in the context of terrorism and security. They have passed resolutions and discussed policies related to the prevention of radicalization, the tracking of foreign fighters, and the reintegration of returnees.

However, the claim as stated is very broad and lacks specific details. It does not provide enough information to fully assess its accuracy. Given that the European Parliament has engaged with the issue of foreign fighters but the claim is vague, it would be reasonable to categorize it as partially accurate but lacking in detail.

They are completely at a standstill. The regions have never even received the lists of beneficiaries.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. **Rei (Reddito di Inclusione) reaching 1.3 million people**: The Reddito di Inclusione (Rei) was an Italian social welfare program aimed at combating poverty. According to official reports and data from the Italian government, the Rei did indeed reach approximately 1.3 million people before it was replaced by the Reddito di Cittadinanza (Rdc).

2. **Rdc (Reddito di Cittadinanza) reaching 1.4 million people to date**: The Reddito di Cittadinanza (Rdc) is the successor to the Rei and is a more comprehensive social welfare program. As of the latest available data, the Rdc has reached around 1.4 million people, which aligns with the claim.

3. **Active policies being at a standstill and regions not receiving lists of beneficiaries**: There have been reports and criticisms regarding the implementation of active labor policies associated with the Rdc. Various sources, including news articles and statements from regional authorities, have indicated delays and issues in the distribution of beneficiary lists to regions, which has hindered the activation of these policies.

Given the information available, the claim appears to be accurate in its specifics about the number of people reached by the Rei and Rdc, as well as the issues with active policies and distribution of beneficiary lists.

“La Argentina es un país que consume el 70% de lo que produce”,mostly true,es,"""Argentina is a country that consumes 70% of what it produces.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Argentina is a country that consumes 70% of what it produces,"" we need to look at the economic data related to Argentina's production and consumption patterns.

1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Consumption**: GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country. Consumption typically refers to the total value of goods and services consumed by households and the government.

2. **Domestic Consumption**: According to data from sources like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Argentina's domestic consumption (household and government consumption expenditure) as a percentage of GDP has varied over the years but has often been around 70%.

3. **Exports and Imports**: Argentina is also an exporter of agricultural products, energy, and other goods. The balance between what is consumed domestically and what is exported can provide insight into the claim.

Given that domestic consumption as a percentage of GDP has been around 70%, the claim that Argentina consumes 70% of what it produces aligns with available economic data.

1. **Check Government Records and Announcements**: Look for official government records, press releases, or announcements that confirm the establishment of such a partnership within the first year of the current administration.
2. **Public Prosecutor's Office and Guardianship Council Statements**: Verify if there are any statements or reports from the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Guardianship Council that corroborate the formation of this partnership.
3. **Media Reports**: Search for credible media reports that cover the establishment of this partnership and its activities.

If all these sources confirm the establishment of the partnership within the first year, the claim would be 'True'. If there is partial evidence or some ambiguity, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If there is no evidence or the partnership was not established as claimed, it would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given that I do not have access to real-time data or specific records, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and the need for verification from multiple sources, I would suggest:

1. **Historical Context**: The concession process for Ibirapuera Park involves transferring the management of the park from public to private hands, typically to improve services and infrastructure through private investment.

2. **Previous Administration Actions**: If the previous administration indeed took steps that directly halted or significantly delayed the concession process, such as implementing policies, regulations, or other measures that created substantial obstacles, then the claim would be more accurate.

3. **Verification**: To verify, we would need to look at specific actions taken by the previous administration, such as public records, official statements, or documented delays directly attributed to their policies.

Without specific evidence or detailed records, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if there is a general consensus or documented instances of the previous administration creating obstacles, the claim could be considered at least partially accurate.

This information is typically available from official sources such as government crime reports, law enforcement agencies, or reputable statistical databases.

Without access to the specific data for the year in question, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on a specific and verifiable source, we can consider the following:

1. **True**: If the exact number of murders reported by a reliable source for the previous year is indeed 3,262.
2. **Mostly True**: If the number is very close to 3,262, with a minor discrepancy that does not significantly alter the overall accuracy.
3. **Half True**: If the number is somewhat close but has a significant enough difference to warrant a more cautious interpretation.
4. **Mostly False**: If the number is considerably different from 3,262, indicating a substantial inaccuracy.
5. **False**: If the number is entirely incorrect and does not align with any credible data.

Given that I do not have access to the specific data for the previous year, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. Therefore, I must refrain from making a final judgment without the necessary information.

Reduzimos para 12 o número de secretarias e à metade o número de cargos de comissão,true,pt,We reduced the number of departments to 12 and halved the number of commission positions.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The number of departments was reduced to 12.
2. The number of commission positions was halved.

If both points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If one point is accurate and the other is not, the claim would be 'Half True'. If neither point is accurate, the claim would be 'False'. If the claim is mostly accurate but has minor inaccuracies, it would be 'Mostly True'. Conversely, if the claim is mostly inaccurate but has some element of truth, it would be 'Mostly False'.

1. Whether the Bundestag aimed to better protect local politicians from hate crimes on March 12, 2020.
2. Whether the person referred to in the statement has received death threats himself.

Upon researching:

1. On March 12, 2020, the Bundestag did indeed discuss measures to better protect local politicians from hate crimes. This was in response to increasing concerns about the safety of public officials following several high-profile incidents.
2. The statement implies that a specific individual, likely a member of the Bundestag or a local politician, has received death threats. Without a specific name, it's challenging to verify this part definitively. However, it is known that several German politicians have received death threats, especially in the context of rising political tensions and hate crimes.

1. The mayor received R$ 153 million during the pandemic.
2. The date of receipt was the last day 16 (assuming this means the 16th of the last month mentioned).
3. Only 29.5% of these resources were effectively spent.

Without access to specific financial records or official statements from the mayor's office, it is challenging to verify these details precisely. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, we can analyze the logical consistency:

- If the mayor received R$ 153 million and spent 29.5% of it, the amount spent would be approximately R$ 45.135 million.
- The claim does not provide a specific timeframe for the spending, which is crucial for context.

Non solo referendum: le leggi di iniziativa popolare,true,it,'Not just referendums: laws by popular initiative'.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Not just referendums: laws by popular initiative,"" we need to understand the distinction between referendums and popular initiatives.

1. **Referendums**: These are votes by the electorate on a specific proposal, often a piece of legislation that has already been passed by a legislative body but requires public approval to become law.

2. **Popular Initiatives**: These allow citizens to propose new laws or amendments to the constitution directly. If a sufficient number of signatures are collected, the proposal is put to a vote by the electorate.

The claim suggests that there are mechanisms beyond referendums, specifically laws created through popular initiatives. This is indeed true in many democratic systems where citizens have the power to propose and vote on laws directly, not just approve or reject laws proposed by the government or legislature.

E il lockdown si è allentato da una settimana soltanto»,false,it,"""The latest data from Inail indicate that 300 people a day in Italy are getting infected at the workplace and ten die. And the lockdown has been eased for only a week.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. **Source Verification**: The claim references data from Inail (Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work). We need to check if Inail has published such data.
2. **Infection Rate**: The claim states that 300 people a day in Italy are getting infected at the workplace.
3. **Death Rate**: The claim states that ten people die each day due to workplace infections.
4. **Timing**: The claim mentions that the lockdown has been eased for only a week.

### Verification Steps:

1. **Inail Data**: Inail regularly publishes reports on workplace accidents and infections, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to find the latest report to confirm the numbers.
2. **Infection and Death Rates**: Cross-reference the numbers with official health and labor statistics from Italy.
3. **Lockdown Easing**: Verify the timeline of Italy's lockdown measures and their easing.

### Findings:

1. **Inail Reports**: Inail has indeed been tracking and reporting workplace infections and fatalities during the pandemic. Their reports are a reliable source for such data.
2. **Infection and Death Rates**: If the latest Inail report confirms that approximately 300 workplace infections and 10 deaths per day are occurring, this part of the claim would be accurate.
3. **Lockdown Easing**: Italy has had multiple phases of lockdown and easing. If the claim is referring to a specific recent easing, we need to confirm the exact timeline.

Tenho projeto de lei que visa a castração química [para o condenado por estupro],mostly true,pt,I have a bill that aims for chemical castration [for those convicted of rape].,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I have a bill that aims for chemical castration [for those convicted of rape],"" we need to verify whether the person making the claim has indeed introduced or sponsored a bill with such provisions.

1. **Check Legislative Records**: Look up the legislative records to see if there is a bill introduced by the person that includes chemical castration for those convicted of rape.
2. **Bill Content**: Verify the content of the bill to ensure it specifically aims for chemical castration as a measure for those convicted of rape.
3. **Context and Details**: Consider any additional context or details that might affect the interpretation of the claim, such as whether the bill is in the proposal stage, has been passed, or is under consideration.

If the person has indeed introduced or sponsored a bill that includes chemical castration for those convicted of rape, the claim would be 'True'. If there are some inaccuracies or additional context needed, the rating might change accordingly.

Given the information provided, I will assume the claim is being made by a legislator or someone in a position to introduce such a bill. Without specific details on the bill number or legislative body, I will proceed with a general verification approach.

**Verification Steps**:
1. **Search for Relevant Bills**: Look up recent bills related to chemical castration for rape convictions in the legislative body the person is associated with.
2. **Identify Sponsorship**: Confirm if the person making the claim is listed as a sponsor or co-sponsor of the bill.
3. **Review Bill Text**: Ensure the bill text includes provisions for chemical castration for those convicted of rape.

Ma in Veneto i bambini vaccinati aumentano o no?,false,it,"But in Veneto, are the vaccinated children increasing or not?","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""But in Veneto, are the vaccinated children increasing or not?"", we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on vaccination rates among children in the Veneto region of Italy.

If recent data from health authorities or reputable sources indicate that the number of vaccinated children in Veneto is indeed increasing, then the claim would be considered 'True'. Conversely, if the data shows a decrease or no significant change, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'. If the data is mixed or unclear, it might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly True'.

Without specific data at hand, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the question is based on a general trend observed in recent reports, we can make an educated guess.

"« Les énergies renouvelables ne représentent que 18% de la capacité actuelle de production d’électricité de l’Afrique. Par conséquent, le développement de solutions alternatives hors réseau pourrait créer beaucoup plus de possibilités et transformer des millions de vies »",half true,fr,"""Renewable energies represent only 18% of Africa's current electricity production capacity. Therefore, the development of off-grid alternative solutions could create many more opportunities and transform millions of lives.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The percentage of Africa's current electricity production capacity that comes from renewable energies.
2. The potential impact of developing off-grid alternative solutions in Africa.

1. **Percentage of Renewable Energy in Africa:**
   According to various sources, including the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and other energy reports, renewable energy sources (such as hydro, solar, wind, and geothermal) contribute to a significant portion of Africa's electricity production. However, the exact percentage can vary depending on the source and the year of the data. As of recent reports, renewable energy accounts for approximately 20-25% of Africa's electricity production capacity. The claim states 18%, which is within a reasonable range but slightly on the lower end of the spectrum.

2. **Impact of Off-Grid Solutions:**
   The development of off-grid alternative solutions, such as solar home systems and mini-grids, is widely recognized as a transformative approach for increasing energy access in Africa. Many regions in Africa are not connected to the main grid, and off-grid solutions can provide electricity to remote and underserved communities, thereby improving quality of life, economic opportunities, and overall development.

Given the information available, the claim that renewable energies represent only 18% of Africa's current electricity production capacity is slightly conservative but not far from the truth. The assertion that off-grid solutions could create many more opportunities and transform millions of lives is well-supported by numerous studies and reports.

È vero: la legge sui vaccini funziona,true,it,It is true: the vaccine law works.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""It is true: the vaccine law works,"" we need to consider the context and evidence supporting the effectiveness of the vaccine law in question. 

1. **Effectiveness of Vaccine Laws**: Generally, vaccine laws are designed to increase vaccination rates and reduce the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases. Numerous studies have shown that mandatory vaccination laws can lead to higher vaccination rates and lower disease incidence.

2. **Specific Context**: The effectiveness of a specific vaccine law can vary based on its implementation, public compliance, and the disease it targets. For example, some vaccine laws may be more effective in certain regions or populations than others.

3. **Evidence and Data**: If there is substantial evidence showing that the vaccine law in question has led to improved public health outcomes, such as higher vaccination rates and reduced disease incidence, the claim would be more likely to be true.

Given the general effectiveness of vaccine laws in improving public health outcomes, and assuming there is evidence supporting the specific law in question, the claim can be considered accurate.

This information is typically available in public financial statements, annual reports, or official announcements from the organization.

Without access to these specific documents or data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on publicly available and accurate data, we can tentatively assess its truthfulness.

False. What does it mean? Sorry, today with food we are the same as Venezuela, launched Cristina Kirchner during the presentation of her ...","To determine the accuracy of the claim made by Cristina Kirchner that ""today with food we are the same as Venezuela,"" we need to compare the food situation in Argentina with that in Venezuela. Venezuela has been experiencing a severe food crisis for several years, characterized by widespread shortages, hyperinflation, and significant malnutrition among its population. 

Argentina, while facing economic challenges and inflation, does not exhibit the same level of food scarcity and crisis as Venezuela. The food situation in Argentina, although problematic, is not comparable to the extreme conditions in Venezuela.

Given this context, the claim that Argentina's food situation is the same as Venezuela's is an exaggeration and not supported by the available evidence.

This gives us an average of 95%.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the statistics provided for access to drinking water in both urban and rural areas, and then calculate the average to see if it matches the stated 95%.

1. **Urban Areas**: The claim states a 98.8% access rate to drinking water.
2. **Rural Areas**: The claim states a 91% access rate to drinking water.
3. **Average Calculation**: The average is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{(98.8\% + 91\%)}{2} = \frac{189.8\%}{2} = 94.9\%
   \]

The calculated average is 94.9%, which is very close to the stated 95%. Given the slight rounding difference, the claim is mostly accurate.

And among the member countries of ECOWAS, it is the only one with a low risk of over-indebtedness.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Senegal is one of the 5 countries in the African Union with a low risk of over-indebtedness.
2. Senegal is the only country in ECOWAS with a low risk of over-indebtedness.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank regularly assess the debt sustainability of countries, including those in Africa. According to their assessments, countries are categorized into different risk levels of debt distress: low, moderate, high, or in debt distress.

As of the latest available data, Senegal is indeed classified as having a low risk of debt distress. However, to confirm the exact number of countries in the African Union with a low risk of over-indebtedness, we would need to cross-reference the most recent debt sustainability analyses for all 55 African Union member states.

Regarding the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which comprises 15 member countries, Senegal is often highlighted as having a relatively stable economic situation and a low risk of debt distress. However, it is essential to verify if it is the only ECOWAS country with this classification.

Based on the most recent data from the IMF and World Bank, it appears that Senegal is indeed one of the few African countries with a low risk of over-indebtedness, and it is the only ECOWAS country with this classification.

“Cuando fui Presidente del Banco Central asumí con una inflación del 40%. La bajamos al 4% en un año”,half true,es,"""When I became President of the Central Bank, inflation was at 40%. We reduced it to 4% in one year.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The initial inflation rate when the person became President of the Central Bank.
2. The inflation rate one year after they took office.
3. The context and time period in which these changes occurred.

Without specific details about the country, the time period, and the individual in question, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is about a well-documented case, such as Paul Volcker's tenure as Chairman of the Federal Reserve in the United States, we can analyze the data from that period.

Paul Volcker became Chairman of the Federal Reserve in August 1979. At that time, the U.S. inflation rate was indeed very high, around 11-13%. By 1980, inflation peaked at around 14-15%. Volcker implemented tight monetary policies, and by 1983, inflation had dropped to around 3-4%.

However, the claim states an initial inflation rate of 40% and a reduction to 4% within one year. This specific scenario does not align with the U.S. case under Volcker or any other well-documented case in major economies.

Given the lack of specific details and the improbability of such a drastic reduction in inflation within one year in most historical contexts, the claim appears exaggerated.

“La deuda pública a fin de año representará el 87% del PBI”,true,es,"""Public debt at the end of the year will represent 87% of GDP.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Public debt at the end of the year will represent 87% of GDP,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Is the claim based on a reliable and authoritative source, such as a government report, a reputable financial institution, or an economic forecast from a credible organization?

2. **Current Data**: What is the most recent data available on public debt and GDP? This can be obtained from official government statistics, central banks, or international organizations like the IMF or World Bank.

3. **Projections and Trends**: Are there any recent projections or trends that support or contradict the claim? Economic forecasts and trends can provide context on whether the 87% figure is plausible.

Without specific data or sources to verify the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a recent and credible projection, we might lean towards it being accurate. Conversely, if there is no supporting data or if recent trends suggest otherwise, the claim could be less accurate.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I will make a reasoned judgment based on typical economic reporting and trends.

“O município de Fortaleza gasta cerca de 30% [do orçamento] em saúde pública.”,true,pt,"""The municipality of Fortaleza spends about 30% [of the budget] on public health.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The municipality of Fortaleza spends about 30% [of the budget] on public health,"" we need to verify the actual budget allocation for public health in Fortaleza.

1. **Research the Budget**: Look up the most recent budget reports or official financial documents from the municipality of Fortaleza. These documents should provide a breakdown of expenditures, including the percentage allocated to public health.

2. **Compare the Claim**: Compare the percentage of the budget allocated to public health in the official documents with the 30% figure mentioned in the claim.

Without access to the most recent and specific budget data for Fortaleza, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information, we can make an educated guess.

**Hypothetical Analysis**:
- If the official documents show that the percentage is very close to 30% (e.g., 28%-32%), the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- If the percentage is somewhat close but not exactly 30% (e.g., 25%-27% or 33%-35%), the claim would be 'Half True'.
- If the percentage is significantly different (e.g., below 25% or above 35%), the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

**Conclusion**:
Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on typical municipal budget allocations, it is plausible that a significant portion of the budget could be dedicated to public health, but exact figures are necessary for a precise classification.

2. **Statements from Officials**: Look for statements from relevant government officials or credible sources confirming or denying any budget changes.
3. **Historical Budget Data**: Compare the current budget with previous years to identify any reductions.

Without access to this specific information, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a credible source and there is no evidence to the contrary, we might lean towards it being accurate.

«Porti aperti e gli ingressi in Italia tornano alle stelle»,false,it,"""Open doors and entries into Italy are skyrocketing again.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Open doors and entries into Italy are skyrocketing again,"" we need to consider recent data and trends regarding immigration and border entries into Italy.

1. **Data on Immigration Trends**: 
   - If recent statistics from reliable sources such as the Italian government, European Union agencies, or international organizations like the UNHCR show a significant increase in the number of people entering Italy, this would support the claim.
   - Conversely, if the data shows stable or decreasing numbers, the claim would be less accurate.

2. **Contextual Factors**:
   - Consider any recent events or policy changes that might have influenced immigration patterns, such as changes in Italian immigration laws, EU policies, or crises in neighboring regions that could lead to increased migration.

3. **Terminology**:
   - The term ""skyrocketing"" implies a very rapid and significant increase. Therefore, even if there is an increase, it must be substantial to meet this criterion.

Based on the information available up to 2023, there have been periods of increased migration to Italy, particularly due to crises in the Middle East and North Africa. However, without specific and current data indicating a recent and significant surge, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim as ""skyrocketing.""

**Research Findings**:
- According to recent reports, there has been an increase in the number of migrants arriving in Italy by sea, particularly in the first half of 2023. This suggests a trend towards higher entries, but whether this constitutes ""skyrocketing"" would depend on the magnitude of the increase compared to previous years.

**Conclusion**:
Given the available information, the claim has some basis in reality but may be exaggerated in its use of the term ""skyrocketing.""

« Le Sénégal a la 4ème meilleure police d’Afrique »,half true,fr,'Senegal has the 4th best police force in Africa.',"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Senegal has the 4th best police force in Africa,"" we need to refer to credible sources that rank police forces in Africa. One such source is the World Internal Security and Police Index (WISPI), which ranks the police forces of various countries based on their ability to provide security and maintain law and order.

As of the latest available data, the WISPI report from 2016 ranked Senegal's police force 4th in Africa. However, rankings can change over time, and more recent data might show a different position.

Given that the claim aligns with the most recent available ranking from a credible source, it can be considered accurate based on that data.

«Multa da 98mld alle slot fu cancellata da magistratura non da mio governo».,true,it,"'The €98 billion fine for slot machines was canceled by the judiciary, not by my government.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and details surrounding the €98 billion fine for slot machines and who was responsible for canceling it.

1. **Background Information**: The €98 billion fine was imposed on slot machine operators in Italy for allegedly evading taxes. This fine was later canceled.

2. **Judiciary vs. Government**: The claim states that the judiciary, not the government, canceled the fine. The judiciary refers to the system of courts that interprets and applies the law, while the government refers to the executive branch that enforces laws and policies.

3. **Verification**: If the cancellation of the fine was indeed a result of a judicial decision (court ruling), then the claim would be accurate. If the cancellation was due to a government decision (executive action), then the claim would be inaccurate.

Based on available information, the fine was canceled by a judicial decision, not by an executive action from the government.

Rosario is a major city in Argentina known for its high crime rates, particularly related to drug trafficking and violent crimes. Junín, on the other hand, is a smaller city and generally has lower crime rates compared to larger urban centers like Rosario.

Without specific and up-to-date crime statistics for both cities, it is challenging to make a precise comparison. However, based on general knowledge and the typical crime trends in these cities, it is unlikely that Junín has crime rates comparable to those of Rosario.

“[La economía] lleva 8 años estancada”,true,es,"""[The economy] has been stagnant for 8 years.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""[The economy] has been stagnant for 8 years,"" we need to consider various economic indicators such as GDP growth, employment rates, inflation, and other relevant metrics over the specified period.

1. **GDP Growth**: If the GDP has shown little to no growth over the past 8 years, this would support the claim of stagnation.
2. **Employment Rates**: If employment rates have remained flat or have not improved significantly, this could also indicate economic stagnation.
3. **Inflation**: Low or stable inflation rates might suggest a lack of economic dynamism.
4. **Other Indicators**: Factors like wage growth, consumer spending, and business investment also play a role in assessing economic health.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made in a context where these indicators have shown minimal change, it could be considered somewhat accurate.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, the claim might be best categorized as:

[…] The biggest waste is certainly the dual seat in Strasbourg. This absurdity costs taxpayers almost 200 million euros per year, which is practically equivalent to 10 percent of the entire Parliament's budget.","To evaluate the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Cost of the European Parliament in 2014**: The claim states it was 1.737 billion euros.
2. **Increase in cost over 5 years**: The claim mentions an increase of over 300 million euros.
3. **Cost of the dual seat in Strasbourg**: The claim asserts it costs taxpayers almost 200 million euros per year.
4. **Percentage of the budget**: The claim states this cost is equivalent to 10 percent of the entire Parliament's budget.

### Verification:

1. **Cost in 2014**: According to official European Parliament budget documents, the budget for 2014 was indeed around 1.737 billion euros.
2. **Increase over 5 years**: By 2019, the budget had increased to approximately 2.035 billion euros, which is an increase of around 298 million euros. This is close to the ""over 300 million"" claim.
3. **Cost of the dual seat in Strasbourg**: Various sources, including reports from the European Court of Auditors and other EU institutions, estimate the cost of maintaining the dual seat (Brussels and Strasbourg) to be around 114 million to 200 million euros annually. The 200 million figure is on the higher end but within the range of reported estimates.
4. **Percentage of the budget**: If the dual seat costs around 200 million euros and the total budget is approximately 2 billion euros, then 200 million euros is indeed about 10 percent of the total budget.

### Conclusion:

The claim is largely accurate based on the available data, though the exact cost of the dual seat can vary slightly depending on the source. The increase in the budget and the percentage calculation are correct.

1. **Lagos GDP**: Lagos is a state in Nigeria, and while it is economically significant, it is not a country. Estimates of Lagos' GDP vary, but it is often cited to be around $100 billion USD.

2. **Cameroon GDP**: According to the World Bank, the GDP of Cameroon is approximately $39 billion USD (as of recent data).

3. **Côte d'Ivoire GDP**: The GDP of Côte d'Ivoire is around $70 billion USD.

4. **Senegal GDP**: The GDP of Senegal is approximately $24 billion USD.

Combining the GDPs of Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, and Senegal:
$39 billion (Cameroon) + $70 billion (Côte d'Ivoire) + $24 billion (Senegal) = $133 billion USD.

Comparing this to the estimated GDP of Lagos ($100 billion USD), the combined GDP of Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, and Senegal ($133 billion USD) is higher than the GDP of Lagos.

Gender quotas are often implemented to ensure a minimum level of female representation in political parties and elected bodies. In Argentina, for example, the gender quota law requires that at least 30% of the candidates on electoral lists be women.

The PRO party, which is a center-right political party in Argentina, has participated in several elections since its founding in 2005. To verify the claim, we would need to look at the candidate lists for these elections and see if the party has consistently included more women than the required quota.

Based on available information, the PRO party has made efforts to comply with gender quotas, and in some instances, they have indeed exceeded the minimum requirement. However, this has not been a consistent trend across all elections.

Given this context, the claim that ""The PRO in several elections has exceeded the female quota"" can be considered accurate but not universally applicable to all elections.

“Faltaba triplicar los parques industriales”,half true,es,"""It was necessary to triple the number of industrial parks.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""It was necessary to triple the number of industrial parks,"" we need to consider the context and evidence supporting the necessity of such an action. This involves evaluating economic, industrial, and policy factors that might justify the need for more industrial parks.

1. **Economic Growth**: If the region or country in question experienced significant economic growth, leading to increased demand for industrial space, this could justify the need to triple the number of industrial parks.
2. **Industrial Demand**: A surge in industrial activities, such as manufacturing, logistics, or technology sectors, could necessitate more industrial parks to accommodate new businesses and expansions.
3. **Government Policy**: Government initiatives aimed at boosting industrial development, creating jobs, or attracting foreign investment might require the establishment of more industrial parks.
4. **Infrastructure Development**: Improvements in infrastructure, such as transportation and utilities, could make it feasible and beneficial to develop additional industrial parks.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively assess the necessity of tripling the number of industrial parks. However, if there is substantial evidence supporting the factors mentioned above, the claim could be considered more accurate.

Given the lack of specific context and evidence in the provided statement, we cannot conclusively determine the necessity of tripling the number of industrial parks. Therefore, the claim remains speculative.

“El 98% de la población de La Matanza está conectada a la red de agua potable”,false,es,"""98% of the population of La Matanza is connected to the potable water network.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""98% of the population of La Matanza is connected to the potable water network,"" we would need to verify the most recent and reliable data from official sources such as government reports, water utility companies, or reputable research studies.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information from a reliable source, it could be considered 'True'. If the data is somewhat outdated or from a less reliable source, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If there is significant evidence to the contrary, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is based on reliable and recent data, the most likely assessment would be:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"«[Nei decreti ""Rilancio"" e “Cura Italia”] che cosa c'entra il Covid con la proroga della concessione aeroportuale di Fiumicino ai Benetton, che vale un regalo da oltre un miliardo?» (min. 6:11)",half true,it,"'[In the ""Relaunch"" and ""Cura Italia"" decrees] what does Covid have to do with the extension of the Fiumicino airport concession to the Benetton family, which amounts to a gift worth over a billion?' (min. 6:11).","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the context and details surrounding the ""Relaunch"" and ""Cura Italia"" decrees, as well as the specifics of the Fiumicino airport concession extension to the Benetton family.

1. **Context of the Decrees**: The ""Relaunch"" and ""Cura Italia"" decrees were Italian government measures aimed at addressing the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decrees included various forms of financial support and regulatory changes to help businesses and individuals affected by the pandemic.

2. **Fiumicino Airport Concession**: The concession for Fiumicino airport, managed by Aeroporti di Roma (ADR), which is controlled by the Benetton family through their holding company Atlantia, was reportedly extended. The extension of such concessions can be seen as a significant financial benefit.

3. **Link to COVID-19**: The claim suggests that the extension of the airport concession was included in the decrees as a form of financial support or regulatory relief, ostensibly due to the economic impact of COVID-19. However, the direct connection between the pandemic relief measures and the specific extension of the concession is not immediately clear without further detailed evidence.

4. **Value of the Concession**: The claim states that the extension is worth over a billion euros. This valuation would depend on the terms of the concession and the financial performance of the airport.

Given the information available, the claim appears to mix factual elements (the existence of the decrees and the extension of the concession) with an interpretation that the extension is a ""gift"" worth over a billion euros. The direct causality implied by the claim (that COVID-19 relief measures directly resulted in the concession extension) is not fully substantiated without more detailed evidence.

"No orçamento de 2017, segundo o projeto de lei apresentado, não está previsto o aumento de imposto",half true,pt,"In the 2017 budget, according to the proposed bill, no tax increase is planned.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In the 2017 budget, according to the proposed bill, no tax increase is planned,"" we would need to review the specific details of the 2017 budget proposal. This includes examining whether any new taxes were introduced or existing taxes were increased.

Given that I don't have access to real-time data or specific documents, I can't verify the exact details of the 2017 budget proposal. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable source and there were no tax increases planned in the proposed bill, the claim would be 'True'.

If there were any tax increases, even minor ones, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False' depending on the extent of the increases.

Without specific details, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, based on the information provided and assuming the claim is accurate:

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
M5S/Lega volevano ridurre la pressione fiscale: lo hanno fatto?,true,it,'M5S/Lega wanted to reduce the tax burden: did they do it?',"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the M5S (Five Star Movement) and Lega (League) wanted to reduce the tax burden and whether they achieved it, we need to look at the specific actions and outcomes during their time in government.

1. **Intentions and Promises**: Both M5S and Lega campaigned on platforms that included reducing the tax burden. Lega, in particular, advocated for a flat tax, while M5S supported measures like a universal basic income which could indirectly affect tax policies.

2. **Government Actions**: During their coalition government from June 2018 to September 2019, several measures were introduced:
   - The introduction of a flat tax for self-employed individuals and small businesses with incomes up to €65,000.
   - Some tax cuts and incentives for businesses.
   - However, broader tax reforms, such as a comprehensive flat tax for all, were not fully implemented.

3. **Outcomes**: The measures taken did provide some tax relief, particularly for small businesses and self-employed individuals. However, the overall tax burden on the general population did not see a significant reduction. Broader and more impactful tax reforms were either delayed or not fully realized during their tenure.

Given this context, the claim that M5S and Lega wanted to reduce the tax burden is accurate in terms of their intentions and some actions taken. However, the extent to which they achieved a significant reduction in the overall tax burden is limited.

Sulla castrazione chimica Matteo Salvini ha ragione,true,it,Matteo Salvini is right about chemical castration.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Matteo Salvini is right about chemical castration,"" we need to consider the context and the specific arguments or statements made by Matteo Salvini regarding chemical castration. Matteo Salvini, an Italian politician, has advocated for the use of chemical castration as a measure against sex offenders. 

The evaluation of whether he is ""right"" about chemical castration involves several factors, including ethical considerations, effectiveness, legal implications, and public opinion. 

1. **Effectiveness**: Some studies suggest that chemical castration can reduce recidivism rates among sex offenders, but it is not a guaranteed solution and may not be effective for all individuals.
2. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of chemical castration raises significant ethical concerns, including issues of bodily autonomy and human rights.
3. **Legal Implications**: The legality of chemical castration varies by country and jurisdiction, and it often requires the consent of the individual undergoing the treatment.
4. **Public Opinion**: Public opinion on chemical castration is divided, with some supporting it as a deterrent and others opposing it on ethical grounds.

Given these complexities, the claim that ""Matteo Salvini is right about chemical castration"" cannot be definitively categorized as entirely true or false without more specific context. However, considering the mixed evidence and significant ethical and legal concerns, the claim is likely to be contentious and not universally accepted.

Le Sénégal est le 5e pays africain dans la lutte contre le paludisme.,true,fr,Senegal is the 5th African country in the fight against malaria.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Senegal is the 5th African country in the fight against malaria,"" we need to consider several factors, including the metrics used to rank countries in their fight against malaria, such as the reduction in malaria cases, the implementation of prevention and treatment programs, and the support from international organizations.

As of the latest data, Senegal has made significant progress in combating malaria. The country has implemented various successful strategies, including widespread distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and effective case management. These efforts have led to a notable reduction in malaria incidence and mortality rates.

However, ranking countries in their fight against malaria is complex and can vary depending on the criteria and the source of the ranking. There is no universally accepted ranking system that places Senegal specifically as the 5th African country in this fight. Therefore, without a specific and credible source to confirm this exact ranking, the claim cannot be verified as entirely accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
E eles [Transparência Internacional] produziram mais de 70 propostas para combate à corrupção,true,pt,And they [Transparency International] produced more than 70 proposals to combat corruption.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that Transparency International produced more than 70 proposals to combat corruption, we need to verify the specific number of proposals they have put forward. Transparency International is known for its extensive work in combating corruption, including publishing reports, recommendations, and proposals.

Upon reviewing available information, Transparency International has indeed produced numerous proposals and recommendations over the years. For instance, their ""Global Corruption Report"" and various policy papers often contain multiple proposals aimed at addressing corruption in different sectors and regions. However, the exact number of proposals can vary depending on the context and the specific documents being referred to.

Given that Transparency International is a prolific organization in the field of anti-corruption and has likely produced a substantial number of proposals over time, the claim that they have produced more than 70 proposals is plausible.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Renzi e l'Africa che cresce,mostly true,it,Renzi and the growing Africa.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Renzi and the growing Africa,"" we need to break down the components of the statement.

1. **Renzi**: This likely refers to Matteo Renzi, an Italian politician who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 2014 to 2016.
2. **Growing Africa**: This phrase suggests that Africa is experiencing growth, which could refer to economic growth, population growth, or other forms of development.

### Analysis:

- **Renzi's Involvement with Africa**: During his tenure as Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi did engage in diplomatic and economic initiatives involving African countries. He emphasized the importance of Africa in global geopolitics and economics, and Italy under his leadership sought to strengthen ties with African nations.

- **Africa's Growth**: Africa has been experiencing significant growth in various sectors. Economically, many African countries have seen substantial GDP growth rates. The continent also has a rapidly growing population and increasing urbanization.

### Conclusion:

The claim ""Renzi and the growing Africa"" can be interpreted as suggesting a connection between Matteo Renzi and the growth occurring in Africa. Given that Renzi did engage with African countries and that Africa is indeed experiencing growth, the claim has a basis in truth. However, the statement is somewhat vague and does not provide specific details about the nature or extent of Renzi's involvement.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
Quem criou a CPMF foi o Fernando Henrique Cardoso,true,pt,Fernando Henrique Cardoso was the one who created the CPMF.,"The claim that ""Fernando Henrique Cardoso was the one who created the CPMF"" is not entirely accurate. The CPMF (Contribuição Provisória sobre Movimentação Financeira) was a temporary tax on financial transactions in Brazil. It was first introduced in 1993 during the presidency of Itamar Franco, with the primary objective of funding the public health system. However, it was during Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidency (1995-2002) that the CPMF was reintroduced and became more prominent.

Given this context, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true, as the initial creation of the CPMF predates Cardoso's presidency, although he played a significant role in its reimplementation and use.

"Le secteur public finance moins de 50 % des dépenses de santé en Afrique de l’Ouest, a récemment déclaré un expert ouest-africain.",true,fr,"The public sector finances less than 50% of health expenditures in West Africa, a West African expert recently stated.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The public sector finances less than 50% of health expenditures in West Africa,"" we need to look at data on health financing in West African countries.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health financing reports, many West African countries rely heavily on out-of-pocket expenditures and external aid for health financing. Public sector financing often constitutes a significant but not majority share of total health expenditures in many of these countries. For instance, in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and others in the region, public sector health financing is often reported to be less than 50% of total health expenditures.

Given this context, the claim appears to be generally accurate.

"La Chine finance les projets d’infrastructures en Afrique plus que la BAD, l’UE, la SFI, la Banque mondiale et le G8 réunis.",true,fr,"China finances infrastructure projects in Africa more than the AfDB, the EU, the IFC, the World Bank, and the G8 combined.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""China finances infrastructure projects in Africa more than the AfDB, the EU, the IFC, the World Bank, and the G8 combined,"" we need to examine available data and reports on infrastructure financing in Africa.

1. **China's Role in African Infrastructure**: China has been a significant financier of infrastructure projects in Africa, with substantial investments in sectors such as transportation, energy, and telecommunications. Chinese financing often comes through loans, grants, and investments from entities like the China Exim Bank and the China Development Bank.

2. **Other Major Financiers**:
   - **African Development Bank (AfDB)**: The AfDB is a major player in financing infrastructure projects across the continent, focusing on sustainable development and regional integration.
   - **European Union (EU)**: The EU provides significant funding for infrastructure projects in Africa, often through grants and development programs.
   - **International Finance Corporation (IFC)**: As part of the World Bank Group, the IFC invests in private sector projects, including infrastructure.
   - **World Bank**: The World Bank provides substantial funding for infrastructure projects in Africa, focusing on poverty reduction and sustainable development.
   - **G8**: The G8 countries (now G7 after Russia's suspension) have various bilateral and multilateral programs that fund infrastructure projects in Africa.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - According to various reports and studies, including those from the World Bank and the African Development Bank, China's financing of infrastructure in Africa has indeed been substantial and, in some cases, surpasses the combined contributions of other major financiers.
   - For instance, a report by the Center for Global Development in 2018 indicated that Chinese infrastructure financing in Africa was larger than that of the World Bank, the AfDB, and other traditional donors combined.

Given the available evidence, the claim appears to be supported by data from credible sources.

“La inversión privada a tan solo tres meses de salir del default suma en anuncios más de US$ 35 mil millones”,half true,es,"""Private investment, just three months after emerging from default, amounts to over US$ 35 billion in announcements.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Context of Default**: We need to confirm if there was a recent default and the timeline of emerging from it.
2. **Private Investment Announcements**: We need to verify if there have been announcements of private investments totaling over US$ 35 billion within three months of emerging from default.

Without specific details or sources to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure and typical economic reporting, such a claim would generally be scrutinized and verified by multiple sources before being widely reported.

1. **Number of people from Emilia and Romagna seeking treatment elsewhere**: The claim states that ""thousands of people from Emilia and Romagna go elsewhere for treatment."" This would require data on patient mobility and healthcare statistics to confirm the exact number of people leaving the region for medical treatment.

2. **Comparison of people leaving versus arriving**: The claim also states that ""More people leave [than those who arrive]."" This would require a comparison of the number of patients leaving Emilia and Romagna for treatment elsewhere versus the number of patients coming into the region for treatment.

Without specific data or statistics to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some observed trends or reports, we might consider it as a general statement rather than an exact figure.

1. **The growth rate of social spending**: The claim states that social spending grew by 43.5%. This can be verified by examining budget reports or official financial statements from the relevant government or organization.

2. **Comparison with other budget items**: The claim implies that the 43.5% increase in social spending is the highest among all budget categories, indicating that investment towards those who have the least increased the most.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify these points definitively. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and that no other budget category grew by a higher percentage, the claim would be 'True'. If other categories had higher growth rates, the claim would be 'False'. If the data is somewhat accurate but not entirely, it could fall into the 'Mostly True' or 'Half True' categories.

“Somos una provincia récord en materia de reducción de mortalidad infantil”,true,es,"""We are a record-breaking province in terms of reducing infant mortality.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are a record-breaking province in terms of reducing infant mortality,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Data Verification**: Check the latest statistics on infant mortality rates in the province in question. Compare these rates to historical data and to other provinces or regions.
2. **Context**: Understand what ""record-breaking"" means in this context. Does it refer to the lowest infant mortality rate ever recorded in the province, the fastest rate of reduction, or some other metric?
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the province's performance to other provinces or regions to see if it indeed stands out as a leader in reducing infant mortality.

Without specific data and context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the province has shown significant improvement in reducing infant mortality rates and has been recognized for this achievement, the claim could be considered accurate to some extent.

Maioria dos [partidos] que estão no palanque do Alckmin estavam no palanque da Dilma,half true,pt,The majority of the [parties] supporting Alckmin were supporting Dilma.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The majority of the [parties] supporting Alckmin were supporting Dilma,"" we need to look at the political context and alliances during the relevant election period in Brazil.

Geraldo Alckmin and Dilma Rousseff were prominent political figures in Brazil, with Alckmin being a member of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) and Dilma Rousseff being a member of the Workers' Party (PT). Historically, these two parties have been political rivals.

In the 2014 Brazilian presidential election, Dilma Rousseff was the incumbent president running for re-election, while Geraldo Alckmin was not a candidate. However, in the 2006 presidential election, Alckmin ran against Lula da Silva, who was Dilma's predecessor and a member of the same party (PT).

Given the historical rivalry between PSDB and PT, it is unlikely that the majority of parties supporting Alckmin would also support Dilma. The political alliances in Brazil tend to be polarized, with parties aligning themselves either with the PSDB or PT, but not both.

1. **Corporate Tax Rate in Hungary**: Hungary has a flat corporate tax rate of 9%, which is one of the lowest in the European Union.

2. **Personal Income Tax Rate in Hungary**: Hungary has a flat personal income tax rate of 15%.

3. **Economic Growth Rate of Hungary**: The economic growth rate can fluctuate year by year. As of the latest available data, Hungary's GDP growth rate has varied. For instance, in 2021, Hungary's GDP growth rate was around 7.1% due to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the growth rate for 2022 and projections for 2023 might be different. The claim of 5% growth could be accurate for a specific year, but it is not a constant figure.

Given the information:

- The corporate tax rate of 9% is accurate.
- The personal income tax rate of 15% is accurate.
- The economic growth rate of 5% is plausible but not consistently accurate for all years.

Considering these points, the claim is mostly accurate but not entirely precise regarding the economic growth rate.

1. **Source Verification**: The claim is attributed to ""The Sunday Standard newspaper."" It is important to verify if this newspaper has indeed reported such a story.
2. **Cultural Practices**: Investigate if there are any known cultural or traditional practices in Kenya that involve the use of marijuana smoke for treating measles.
3. **Medical Evidence**: Check for any medical or scientific evidence supporting or refuting the use of marijuana smoke as a treatment for measles.

Without access to the specific article from ""The Sunday Standard"" and without corroborating evidence from reliable sources, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, based on general medical knowledge, using marijuana smoke to treat measles is not a recognized or recommended medical practice.

Given the lack of verifiable evidence and the unlikelihood of such a treatment being medically endorsed, the claim appears dubious.

Les Nigérians sont les immigrés les plus instruits aux Etats-Unis.,false,fr,Nigerians are the most educated immigrants in the United States.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Nigerians are the most educated immigrants in the United States,"" we need to examine available data and research on the educational attainment of various immigrant groups in the U.S.

Several studies and reports have highlighted that Nigerian immigrants in the United States have high levels of educational attainment. For example, a 2018 report from the Migration Policy Institute noted that 59% of Nigerian immigrants aged 25 and older held at least a bachelor's degree, which is significantly higher than the overall foreign-born population (31%) and the U.S.-born population (32%).

Additionally, a 2015 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau found that Nigerian immigrants had one of the highest levels of educational attainment among immigrant groups, with a significant proportion holding advanced degrees.

While these statistics strongly support the claim, it is important to note that educational attainment can vary widely among different immigrant groups, and there may be other groups with similarly high or higher levels of education. However, based on the available data, Nigerians are indeed among the most educated immigrant groups in the United States.

“No está perdiendo contra la inflación”,false,es,"""He/She/It is not losing against inflation.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""He/She/It is not losing against inflation,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context**: The claim is quite broad and lacks specific context. Inflation affects different people, entities, and assets in various ways. For example, someone with investments that outpace inflation might not be losing against it, while someone with fixed income might be.

2. **Measurement**: Inflation is typically measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other similar indices. To not be losing against inflation, the growth of income, investments, or assets should at least match or exceed the rate of inflation.

3. **Time Frame**: Inflation rates can vary over time. A short-term assessment might differ from a long-term one.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, the statement is broad enough that it could be true in some cases and false in others.

Giorgia Meloni, as a political figure, might have made various comparisons between Italy and Austria on different topics such as economic performance, immigration policies, cultural aspects, or political systems.

Without specific details on what aspect she is comparing, it is challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we assume that the comparison is based on a specific, verifiable statement she made, we would need to fact-check that particular statement.

1. **Acquittal by the Supreme Federal Court**: This means that the highest court in the jurisdiction found the individual not guilty of the charges.
2. **Specific Charge**: The charge in question is the use of public money to hire a cabinet employee for private service.

If the Supreme Federal Court has indeed acquitted the individual of this specific charge, then the claim would be 'True'. If the court did not acquit the individual or if the acquittal was for a different charge, then the claim would be 'False'.

Without specific details or evidence to confirm the court's decision, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the context provided is accurate and the Supreme Federal Court did acquit the individual of the specific charge, the claim would be 'True'.

Le carceri italiane hanno un problema: sono le più sovraffollate,true,it,Italian prisons have a problem: they are the most overcrowded.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Italian prisons have a problem: they are the most overcrowded,"" we need to consider the context and available data on prison overcrowding in Italy compared to other countries.

1. **Overcrowding in Italian Prisons**: It is well-documented that Italian prisons face significant overcrowding issues. Reports from various sources, including the Council of Europe and national statistics, indicate that Italy has a high prison population density, often exceeding the official capacity.

2. **Comparison with Other Countries**: While Italy's prison overcrowding is a serious issue, it is not necessarily the ""most"" overcrowded when compared globally. Other countries, such as the Philippines, Haiti, and El Salvador, also experience severe overcrowding, often at higher rates than Italy.

Given this information, the claim that Italian prisons are the ""most overcrowded"" is an exaggeration. While they are indeed overcrowded, they are not the most overcrowded in the world.

“Hoy paga lo mismo [de impuesto a las Ganancias] quien gana $5 millones por año que el que gana 250 mil”,false,es,"""Today, someone who earns $5 million per year pays the same [income tax] as someone who earns $250,000.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand how the U.S. federal income tax system works. The U.S. federal income tax system is progressive, meaning that tax rates increase as income increases. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Tax Brackets**: The U.S. tax system has multiple tax brackets, and individuals are taxed at different rates depending on their income levels. For example, in 2023, the tax brackets for single filers are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.

2. **Marginal Tax Rates**: Individuals pay different rates on different portions of their income. For instance, a person earning $250,000 and a person earning $5 million will both pay 10% on their first $11,000 (for single filers in 2023), 12% on the next portion, and so on, up to the highest applicable rate.

3. **Effective Tax Rate**: The effective tax rate is the average rate at which an individual’s income is taxed. It is generally lower than the highest marginal tax rate because the lower portions of income are taxed at lower rates.

Given these points, the claim that someone who earns $5 million per year pays the same income tax as someone who earns $250,000 is not accurate. While both individuals may fall into the highest tax bracket (37% in 2023), the person earning $5 million will pay significantly more in total taxes because they have more income subject to the higher rates.

1. **Ministry of the Interior's Role**: The Ministry of the Interior in many countries is responsible for internal affairs, which can include issuing guidelines to prefects (regional representatives of the central government).

2. **Guidelines on ""Relatives""**: It is plausible that the Ministry of the Interior might issue guidelines on various administrative matters, including the definition of ""relatives,"" especially if it pertains to legal, social, or administrative contexts.

3. **Reiteration of Interpretation**: The claim states that the Ministry reiterated the interpretation of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. This implies that there was a pre-existing interpretation from the Presidency that the Ministry is now reinforcing.

Given these points, the claim seems plausible and consistent with the roles and responsibilities of the Ministry of the Interior and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. However, without specific evidence or a direct source confirming this exact action, we cannot be entirely certain.

«Cresce il consumo di droga e cresce anche la vendita delle armi nel nostro Paese»,half true,it,"""Drug consumption is increasing and so is the sale of weapons in our country.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Drug consumption is increasing and so is the sale of weapons in our country,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Drug Consumption Trends**: 
   - We need to look at reliable data sources such as government health agencies, research studies, and reports from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) or the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to see if there is a documented increase in drug consumption.

2. **Sale of Weapons Trends**:
   - Similarly, we need to examine data from government reports, law enforcement agencies, and research institutions that track weapon sales and ownership to determine if there is an increase.

Without specific data or sources to verify these trends, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on observable trends reported in recent years, we can make an educated guess.

Given that there have been numerous reports and studies indicating rising concerns about drug use and increased firearm sales in various countries, especially in the context of socio-economic challenges and political instability, the claim could be seen as having some basis in reality.

**However, without concrete data, the most accurate categorization would be:**

"“De los cuatro puntos del PBI de subsidios, dos puntos van a gente que no lo necesita”",half true,es,"""Of the four percentage points of GDP in subsidies, two points go to people who do not need it.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Of the four percentage points of GDP in subsidies, two points go to people who do not need it,"" we need to evaluate the underlying data and context. This involves understanding the distribution of subsidies within the GDP and identifying the proportion that goes to individuals or entities that do not require financial assistance.

1. **Subsidies as a Percentage of GDP**: The claim states that subsidies amount to four percentage points of GDP. This figure needs to be verified against official economic data or reports from credible sources such as government financial statements or economic research institutions.

2. **Distribution of Subsidies**: The claim further asserts that half of these subsidies (two percentage points of GDP) are allocated to people who do not need them. This requires an analysis of subsidy distribution, identifying which segments of the population or sectors receive subsidies and assessing their financial need.

3. **Need Assessment**: Determining who ""needs"" subsidies can be subjective and depends on criteria such as income levels, economic status, and specific policy goals. Typically, subsidies are intended to support low-income individuals, essential industries, or sectors facing economic challenges.

Without specific data or a detailed breakdown of subsidy allocation and the criteria used to assess need, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on a credible analysis or report, it could be considered plausible.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, but assuming the claim is based on some form of analysis, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Parole a confronto: la nuova Costituzione italiana e quella tedesca,mostly true,it,Words in comparison: the new Italian Constitution and the German one.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Words in comparison: the new Italian Constitution and the German one,"" we need to consider the context and content of both constitutions.

1. **Italian Constitution**: The current Italian Constitution was enacted on January 1, 1948. It is a comprehensive document that outlines the fundamental principles of the Italian Republic, the rights and duties of citizens, and the organization of the government.

2. **German Constitution (Basic Law)**: The German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) was enacted on May 23, 1949. It serves as the constitution of Germany and outlines the fundamental rights of citizens, the structure of the government, and the principles of the state.

Both documents are foundational legal texts for their respective countries and cover similar areas such as fundamental rights, the structure of government, and the principles of the state. However, the claim does not specify what aspect of the constitutions is being compared (e.g., length, content, specific provisions).

Given that both constitutions are indeed comparable in terms of their purpose and scope, the claim that they can be compared is accurate. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine the exact nature of the comparison being made.

“Macri nos deja más de 2 millones de desocupados”,true,es,"""Macri leaves us with more than 2 million unemployed.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Macri leaves us with more than 2 million unemployed,"" we need to look at the unemployment statistics during Mauricio Macri's presidency in Argentina, which lasted from December 2015 to December 2019.

According to data from Argentina's National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC), the unemployment rate fluctuated during Macri's term. By the end of his presidency in the third quarter of 2019, the unemployment rate was around 9.7%. Given Argentina's labor force of approximately 20 million people, this would translate to roughly 1.94 million unemployed individuals.

While this figure is close to 2 million, it does not exceed it. Therefore, the claim that Macri left ""more than 2 million unemployed"" is not entirely accurate.

"13,9 % des jeunes filles sont excisées au Sénégal.",half true,fr,13.9% of young girls are circumcised in Senegal.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""13.9% of young girls are circumcised in Senegal,"" we need to refer to reliable sources such as reports from international organizations like UNICEF, WHO, or other reputable studies on female genital mutilation (FGM) in Senegal.

According to UNICEF's data on FGM, the prevalence of FGM among girls and women aged 15-49 in Senegal is around 24%. However, the prevalence among younger girls (under 15) is generally lower due to ongoing efforts to reduce the practice.

Given that the claim specifies ""young girls"" and not the broader age range, it is plausible that the percentage could be lower than the overall prevalence rate for the 15-49 age group. However, without specific data on the exact age group referred to as ""young girls,"" it is challenging to verify the exact figure of 13.9%.

Based on available data, the claim seems to be in the ballpark but may not be entirely precise.

1. ""Today, the same amount of energy is consumed for industrial production as was consumed on March 19.""
2. ""And the consumption is higher.""

The first part of the statement suggests that the energy consumption for industrial production today is the same as it was on March 19. The second part of the statement then claims that the consumption is higher, which seems contradictory to the first part.

"Dalla Tav all'Ilva, le “retromarce” del M5s sono colpa di accordi «all'oscuro degli italiani»?",false,it,"From the Tav to Ilva, are the M5S's ""reversals"" the result of agreements ""kept in the dark from Italians""?","To determine the accuracy of the claim that the M5S's ""reversals"" on issues like the Tav (Turin-Lyon high-speed rail) and Ilva (steel plant) are the result of agreements ""kept in the dark from Italians,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: The M5S (Five Star Movement) has indeed made significant policy reversals on these issues. Initially, the M5S was strongly opposed to the Tav project and had a critical stance on the Ilva steel plant due to environmental concerns.

2. **Political Dynamics**: The M5S has been part of coalition governments, which often require compromises and negotiations with coalition partners. These negotiations can lead to policy shifts that may not always be fully transparent to the public.

3. **Public Statements and Transparency**: While some decisions and agreements in politics are made behind closed doors, the extent to which these specific reversals were ""kept in the dark"" from Italians would require evidence of deliberate secrecy or lack of communication from the M5S.

4. **Media and Public Perception**: Media reports and public perception can sometimes amplify the sense of secrecy or betrayal, especially when a political party changes its stance on key issues.

Given these considerations, the claim that the M5S's reversals are the result of agreements ""kept in the dark from Italians"" is likely an oversimplification. While there may have been some lack of transparency, it is also common in coalition politics to have negotiations that are not fully public.

"Roraima, que exportava arroz, agora [após a demarcação de Raposa Serra do Sol] importa [arroz]",half true,pt,"Roraima, which used to export rice, now [after the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol] imports [rice].","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Roraima, which used to export rice, now [after the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol] imports [rice],"" we need to examine the historical and current context of rice production and importation in Roraima, Brazil.

1. **Historical Context**: Before the demarcation of the Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Territory in 2005, Roraima was known for its rice production. The demarcation led to the removal of non-indigenous rice farmers from the area, which significantly impacted local rice production.

2. **Current Context**: After the demarcation, rice production in Roraima decreased. However, it is important to verify whether this decrease led to the state importing rice to meet its needs.

3. **Import Data**: According to various reports and data, Roraima's rice production did decline after the demarcation. However, the state still produces rice, and there is no substantial evidence to suggest that Roraima now imports rice in significant quantities to meet its needs. The state may import some rice, but it is not a major importer.

Given this information, the claim that Roraima ""now imports [rice]"" after the demarcation is an overstatement. While rice production did decrease, the state has not become a significant importer of rice.

Paola Taverna sui tagli agli aumenti previsti per la sanità ha (quasi) ragione,mostly true,it,Paola Taverna is (almost) right about the cuts to the planned increases for healthcare.,"To determine the accuracy of Paola Taverna's claim about the cuts to the planned increases for healthcare, we need to evaluate the context and specifics of her statement. 

1. **Understanding the Claim**: Paola Taverna is suggesting that there have been cuts to the planned increases in healthcare funding. This implies that while there were plans to increase healthcare funding, those plans have been reduced or cut.

2. **Evaluating the Context**: 
   - If the government had indeed planned to increase healthcare funding but later reduced the amount of the increase, this would support her claim.
   - If the planned increases were entirely cut, this would also support her claim.
   - If there were no planned increases or if the increases were implemented as planned, her claim would be false.

3. **Checking the Facts**: 
   - If available, we would look at government budget documents, official statements, and credible news sources to verify if there were planned increases in healthcare funding and whether those plans were altered.

Given the phrasing ""almost right,"" it suggests that there might be some nuance to the claim. For example, the planned increases might have been reduced but not entirely cut, or the cuts might not be as significant as implied.

1. **Reduction of the Age of Criminal Responsibility**: This part of the claim is a factual statement about a policy proposal or action. Whether or not this is being pursued can be verified through government records, legislative proposals, or official statements from relevant authorities.

2. **What the People Want and Desire**: This part of the claim is more subjective and would require evidence from public opinion polls, surveys, or other forms of public sentiment analysis to determine if a majority of people support the reduction of the age of criminal responsibility.

Without specific data or evidence to support the second part of the claim, it is difficult to definitively state that it is what the people want and desire. Public opinion can vary widely based on demographics, regions, and other factors.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the claim to support the assertion that it is what the people want and desire, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

Bellanova ha ragione: agli agricoltori rimangono le briciole,mostly true,it,Bellanova is right: farmers are left with the crumbs.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Bellanova is right: farmers are left with the crumbs,"" we need to consider the context and evidence supporting or refuting the statement.

1. **Context**: Teresa Bellanova, an Italian politician and former Minister of Agriculture, has been vocal about the challenges faced by farmers, particularly in terms of their share of profits in the agricultural supply chain. She has argued that farmers often receive a minimal portion of the final retail price of their products.

2. **Evidence**:
   - **Economic Data**: Studies and reports from various agricultural organizations and economic research often show that farmers receive a small fraction of the retail price of agricultural products. The majority of the profits are typically absorbed by intermediaries, processors, and retailers.
   - **Market Dynamics**: The agricultural market is characterized by a long supply chain with multiple intermediaries, which can dilute the share of profits that reach the farmers.
   - **Policy and Advocacy**: There have been numerous calls for policy changes to ensure fairer distribution of profits within the agricultural sector, indicating a recognition of the issue Bellanova highlights.

Given this context and evidence, the claim that ""farmers are left with the crumbs"" aligns with the general understanding of the economic challenges faced by farmers in the supply chain.

2. The percentage increase in electric power demand during the ""neoliberal phase,"" which typically refers to the period of economic policies characterized by deregulation, privatization, and free-market capitalism. This period can vary by country but often refers to the 1980s and 1990s.

Let's break down the claim:

- The claim states that electric power demand expanded by 41% between 2003 and 2011.
- It also states that this increase is almost 50% more than the increase during the neoliberal phase.

To verify this, we would need historical data on electric power demand for the specified periods. Without access to specific data sources, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim.

If we assume the neoliberal phase saw a 27.33% increase in electric power demand (since 41% is 50% more than 27.33%), we need to check if this aligns with historical trends.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, we can only evaluate the logical structure of the claim. If the numbers provided are accurate, the claim would be logically consistent.

1. The number of pregnancies in schools in Dakar.
2. Whether Dakar is considered a poor performer in this context.

Without specific data or sources to verify these components, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some reported statistics or studies, we can make an educated guess.

If there are credible reports or studies indicating that there have been around 1200 pregnancies in schools in Dakar and that this number is significantly higher compared to other regions, then the claim could be considered accurate.

However, if there is no reliable data to support the number of pregnancies or the assertion that Dakar is a poor performer, the claim would be less credible.

1. **Context of the Promise**: João Doria, the former mayor of São Paulo, had promised not to leave his mayoral position before the end of his term. However, he left the office to run for governor of São Paulo.

2. **Disapproval Rating**: The claim states that Doria has a 60% disapproval rating in São Paulo. This figure would need to be verified with reliable polling data to confirm its accuracy.

3. **Causality**: The claim suggests a direct causal relationship between Doria breaking his promise and his disapproval rating. While breaking a promise can certainly affect public opinion, disapproval ratings are influenced by multiple factors, including policy decisions, economic conditions, and other political actions.

Given these points, the claim oversimplifies the situation by attributing the disapproval rating solely to the broken promise. While the broken promise likely contributed to the disapproval, it is not the only factor.

1. Italy's ranking within the G7 in terms of the percentage of public development aid relative to gross national income (GNI).
2. The specific percentage of 0.30% and whether it was achieved ahead of schedule.

The G7 countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Public development aid (ODA) as a percentage of GNI is a commonly used metric to assess a country's commitment to international development.

According to the latest data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other reliable sources, Italy's ODA as a percentage of GNI has been around 0.30% in recent years. However, the exact ranking within the G7 can fluctuate based on annual contributions and economic changes.

As of the most recent data, Italy is not consistently the fourth highest in the G7 for ODA as a percentage of GNI. Countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and France typically have higher percentages, while others like the United States and Japan often have lower percentages.

Given this information, the claim that Italy is the fourth country in the G7 in terms of the percentage of public development aid relative to GNI is not consistently supported by the most recent data. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

1. **Eurobonds Definition**: Eurobonds generally refer to bonds issued in a currency not native to the country where it is issued. However, in the context of European Union discussions, ""eurobonds"" often refer to jointly issued debt by EU member states.

2. **Historical Context**: The concept of jointly issued European bonds (eurobonds) has been a topic of discussion, especially during financial crises, but the European Union has not historically issued such bonds until more recent times. The first significant move towards joint debt issuance by the EU was the issuance of bonds to fund the SURE program in 2020 and the NextGenerationEU recovery fund.

3. **45 Years Ago**: 45 years ago from 2023 would be 1978. During this period, the European Economic Community (EEC), the precursor to the EU, did not issue joint bonds. The idea of eurobonds as jointly issued debt by European countries did not materialize in that era.

Given this information, the claim that ""Europe issued 'eurobonds' 45 years ago"" is not accurate in the context of jointly issued European debt.

However, without specific context or data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. Therefore, based on the general understanding of what constitutes a small government, we can make an educated assessment.

Giulia Grillo sbaglia: i medici e gli infermieri italiani non sono i meno pagati,false,it,Giulia Grillo is wrong: Italian doctors and nurses are not the lowest paid.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Giulia Grillo is wrong: Italian doctors and nurses are not the lowest paid,"" we need to examine the context and available data on the salaries of healthcare professionals in Italy compared to those in other countries.

1. **Doctors' Salaries**: According to various sources, including the OECD, Italian doctors' salaries are generally lower than those in many other Western European countries but are not the lowest in Europe. Countries like Poland, Hungary, and some other Eastern European nations tend to have lower salaries for doctors.

2. **Nurses' Salaries**: Similarly, Italian nurses' salaries are also lower compared to their counterparts in countries like Germany, the UK, and France. However, they are not the lowest in Europe. Nurses in countries such as Romania and Bulgaria typically earn less.

Given this information, the claim that Italian doctors and nurses are not the lowest paid is accurate. They are indeed not the lowest paid in Europe, although their salaries are on the lower end compared to many Western European countries.

"L'Afrique perd chaque année environ 370 milliards de francs CFA, à cause de l'aflatoxine, annonce le Partenariat pour pour la lutte contre l'aflatoxine.",half true,fr,"Africa loses approximately 370 billion CFA francs each year due to aflatoxin, announces the Partnership for Aflatoxin Control.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Africa loses approximately 370 billion CFA francs each year due to aflatoxin, announces the Partnership for Aflatoxin Control,"" we need to verify the information from reliable sources.

Aflatoxins are toxic compounds produced by certain molds that can contaminate food supplies, particularly in regions with warm and humid climates, such as parts of Africa. These toxins can have severe health impacts and economic consequences, including loss of crops, reduced livestock productivity, and increased healthcare costs.

The Partnership for Aflatoxin Control in Africa (PACA) is an organization that works to mitigate the impact of aflatoxins on the continent. According to PACA and other related studies, aflatoxin contamination does indeed result in significant economic losses for African countries. The figure of 370 billion CFA francs (approximately 700 million USD) is often cited in reports and publications related to the economic impact of aflatoxins in Africa.

Given that this figure is frequently mentioned in credible sources and aligns with the known economic impact of aflatoxins, the claim appears to be accurate.

Essa declaração [de que mulheres devem ganhar menos do que homens no mercado de trabalho] não é da minha boca. Botaram na minha conta,false,pt,That statement [that women should earn less than men in the job market] did not come from my mouth. They attributed it to me.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify whether the statement in question was indeed made by the person who is denying it. This involves checking reliable sources, such as news reports, interviews, or official records, to see if there is any evidence that the person made the statement.

Without specific details about who made the claim and the context in which it was made, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the person has been misquoted or misattributed, and there is no verifiable evidence that they made the statement, the claim could be considered 'True'.

Conversely, if there is evidence that the person did make the statement, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information and context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the general process of verification, I would lean towards:

“Desde que gobierna Macri sus políticas fundieron a más de tres mil PyMEs”,half true,es,"""Since Macri has been in power, his policies have caused more than three thousand small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to go bankrupt.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Since Macri has been in power, his policies have caused more than three thousand small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to go bankrupt,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Verification of Data**: We need to check reliable sources and data to confirm the number of SMEs that went bankrupt during Macri's tenure.
2. **Causation vs. Correlation**: Even if the number of bankruptcies is accurate, attributing them directly to Macri's policies requires a detailed analysis of economic conditions, other contributing factors, and specific policies implemented by his administration.

**Mauricio Macri's Presidency**:
- Mauricio Macri served as the President of Argentina from December 2015 to December 2019.
- His administration implemented several economic reforms, including austerity measures, reduction of subsidies, and attempts to control inflation.

**Economic Context**:
- Argentina faced significant economic challenges during Macri's presidency, including high inflation, recession, and a substantial national debt.
- These economic conditions could have contributed to the difficulties faced by SMEs.

**Sources and Reports**:
- Various reports and analyses from economic think tanks, government agencies, and independent organizations would be necessary to confirm the exact number of SME bankruptcies and their causes.

Given the complexity of economic conditions and the need for precise data to attribute causation directly to Macri's policies, a definitive answer requires thorough investigation.

**Conclusion**:
Without access to specific and detailed data, it is challenging to definitively confirm the claim. However, considering the economic difficulties during Macri's tenure, it is plausible that many SMEs faced hardships.

Maroni e la gravità della scabbia,false,it,'Maroni and the severity of scabies',"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Maroni and the severity of scabies,"" we need to understand the context and the relationship between ""Maroni"" and ""scabies."" 

1. **Maroni**: This term could refer to a person, place, or entity. Without additional context, it's unclear what ""Maroni"" specifically refers to.
2. **Scabies**: A skin condition caused by the infestation of the skin by the human itch mite (Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis).

Given the lack of context and specific information linking ""Maroni"" to the severity of scabies, it is difficult to verify the claim. There is no widely known or established connection between a term ""Maroni"" and the severity of scabies in medical literature or common knowledge.

“En [los] Estados Unidos para medir la inflación no los toman [a los alimentos y a la energía]”,false,es,"""In the United States, to measure inflation, they do not include food and energy.""","The claim that ""In the United States, to measure inflation, they do not include food and energy"" is not entirely accurate. The U.S. measures inflation using several indices, the most common being the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI includes food and energy prices. However, there is also a measure called the ""Core CPI,"" which excludes food and energy prices because these categories can be very volatile and can distort the overall inflation trend.

Therefore, the claim is misleading because it suggests that food and energy are never included in inflation measurements, which is not true. They are included in the overall CPI but excluded in the Core CPI.

Joaquim Barbosa se referiu à minha pessoa como o único deputado da base aliada que não foi comprado pelo PT,half true,pt,Joaquim Barbosa referred to me as the only deputy in the allied base who was not bought by the PT.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that Joaquim Barbosa referred to someone as ""the only deputy in the allied base who was not bought by the PT,"" we need to verify if Joaquim Barbosa, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil, made such a statement and if it was directed at a specific individual.

1. **Context**: Joaquim Barbosa is known for his role in the Mensalão scandal, a major political corruption case in Brazil involving the Workers' Party (PT). He was the rapporteur of the case and played a significant role in the trial and conviction of several politicians.

2. **Verification**: There is no widely known or documented instance where Joaquim Barbosa explicitly made such a statement about a specific deputy. Public records, interviews, and Barbosa's own statements would need to be examined to confirm this claim.

3. **Public Statements**: If there are no verifiable public statements or credible sources confirming that Joaquim Barbosa made this specific remark, the claim would be considered unsubstantiated.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim and the need for concrete verification, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated.

“Scioli pagó por publicidad oficial $1.500 millones [en 2015]”,mostly true,es,"""Scioli paid $1.5 billion for official advertising [in 2015].""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Scioli paid $1.5 billion for official advertising [in 2015],"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Who is Scioli?** Daniel Scioli is an Argentine politician who served as the Governor of Buenos Aires Province from 2007 to 2015 and was a presidential candidate in 2015.

2. **Context of the Claim:** The claim suggests that Scioli, in his capacity as Governor of Buenos Aires Province, spent $1.5 billion on official advertising in the year 2015.

3. **Verification of the Amount:** We need to check reliable sources, such as government expenditure reports, credible news articles, or official statements, to confirm whether this amount was indeed spent on official advertising.

4. **Currency Clarification:** The claim does not specify whether the $1.5 billion is in Argentine Pesos (ARS) or US Dollars (USD). This distinction is crucial because the value differs significantly.

5. **Historical Context:** It is important to consider the economic context of Argentina in 2015, including the exchange rate and the typical budget for official advertising.

Without access to specific data sources or detailed financial reports from the Buenos Aires Province government for 2015, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge and the context provided, spending $1.5 billion USD on official advertising in a single year seems highly improbable for a provincial government.

**Research Findings:**
- If the claim refers to $1.5 billion USD, it is likely exaggerated.
- If the claim refers to $1.5 billion ARS, it might be more plausible but still requires verification.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support the exact figure and the ambiguity regarding the currency, the claim appears to be an overstatement.

“Todavía en la Argentina el 55% de los que trabajan se llevan al bolsillo $3200”,mostly true,es,"""Still in Argentina, 55% of those who work take home $3200.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Still in Argentina, 55% of those who work take home $3200,"" we need to consider several factors, including the current economic data, average wages, and the distribution of income in Argentina.

1. **Current Economic Data**: As of the latest available data, the average monthly salary in Argentina is significantly lower than $3200 USD. According to various sources, including government statistics and international economic reports, the average monthly wage in Argentina is much less, often cited around $500 to $1000 USD.

2. **Income Distribution**: The claim suggests that more than half of the working population earns $3200, which would imply a very high median income. Given the economic conditions and income distribution in Argentina, this figure seems highly unlikely. The majority of workers earn considerably less, and only a small percentage of the population would earn such a high amount.

3. **Currency and Inflation**: Argentina has faced significant inflation and currency devaluation issues, which further complicates the conversion of local salaries to USD. Even high-earning professionals in Argentina typically do not reach the $3200 USD mark on a monthly basis.

Based on these points, the claim appears to be highly exaggerated and not reflective of the actual economic situation in Argentina.

As of the latest available data:

1. **Senegal**: According to the IMF and World Bank, Senegal's debt-to-GDP ratio has been fluctuating but has been reported to be around 65% in recent years.
2. **Burkina Faso**: The debt-to-GDP ratio for Burkina Faso has been reported to be lower than Senegal's, but it has been closer to 40-50% in recent years, not 32%.
3. **Côte d'Ivoire**: Côte d'Ivoire's debt-to-GDP ratio has also been higher than 32%, typically reported around 40-50%.

Given this information, the claim that Senegal's debt level is at 65% of GDP is accurate, but the figures for Burkina Faso and Côte d'Ivoire are not. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

A verdade é que todas essas matérias [voto distrital e voto distrital misto] já foram tratadas quando Eduardo Cunha foi presidente da Casa,mostly true,pt,The truth is that all these matters [district voting and mixed district voting] were already addressed when Eduardo Cunha was the president of the House.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""all these matters [district voting and mixed district voting] were already addressed when Eduardo Cunha was the president of the House,"" we need to consider the historical context and actions taken during Eduardo Cunha's tenure as the president of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.

Eduardo Cunha served as the president of the Chamber of Deputies from February 2015 until his suspension in May 2016. During his tenure, there were indeed discussions and legislative efforts related to electoral reform, including district voting and mixed district voting systems. However, whether ""all these matters"" were fully addressed is a nuanced issue.

1. **District Voting and Mixed District Voting**: These are specific electoral systems that were part of broader discussions on electoral reform in Brazil. District voting refers to electing representatives from specific geographic areas, while mixed district voting combines elements of both district and proportional representation systems.

2. **Legislative Actions**: During Cunha's presidency, there were significant debates and some legislative proposals regarding electoral reform. However, not all proposed reforms were fully enacted or implemented. The discussions and proposals were part of an ongoing process that extended beyond Cunha's tenure.

3. **Extent of Addressing the Matters**: While Cunha's leadership saw substantial debate and some progress on these issues, it is not entirely accurate to say that all matters related to district voting and mixed district voting were fully addressed. The legislative process is complex, and many proposals require extensive negotiation and approval across multiple sessions and political cycles.

Given this context, the claim that ""all these matters were already addressed when Eduardo Cunha was the president of the House"" is an overstatement. While significant discussions and some actions took place, it is not accurate to say that all matters were fully addressed.

1. The rice production of the 2016 season increased by 5% compared to the previous year (2015).
2. The rice production of the 2016 season increased by 71% compared to the average of the last five years (2011-2015).

Without the actual data for rice production in 2015 and the average production from 2011 to 2015, we cannot definitively verify these claims. However, if we assume the data provided in the claim is accurate, then the statement would be 'True'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, we can only evaluate the logical consistency of the statement based on the information provided.

La sanità italiana è davvero «un’eccellenza mondiale»?,mostly true,it,"Is Italian healthcare really ""a world-class excellence""?","To determine whether the claim that Italian healthcare is ""a world-class excellence"" is accurate, we need to consider various factors such as international rankings, quality of care, accessibility, and outcomes.

1. **International Rankings**: Italy's healthcare system is often highly ranked in global assessments. For instance, the World Health Organization (WHO) ranked Italy's healthcare system as the 2nd best in the world in its 2000 report. More recent rankings, such as those by Bloomberg, have also placed Italy's healthcare system among the top in terms of efficiency.

2. **Quality of Care**: Italy has a high life expectancy and low infant mortality rates, which are indicators of good healthcare quality. The country also has a well-established network of hospitals and clinics, and it provides a wide range of medical services.

3. **Accessibility**: Italy has a universal healthcare system, meaning that all residents have access to healthcare services. This is a significant factor in considering the system's excellence.

4. **Outcomes**: Italy performs well in various health outcomes, including cancer survival rates and management of chronic diseases.

However, there are also some challenges:
- **Regional Disparities**: There are significant differences in the quality of healthcare between the northern and southern regions of Italy.
- **Bureaucracy and Waiting Times**: Some patients experience long waiting times for certain procedures and treatments.

Given these points, while there are some areas for improvement, the overall evidence supports the claim that Italian healthcare is of high quality and can be considered among the best in the world.

La solution est assez simple,false,fr,The solution is quite simple.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The solution is quite simple,"" we need to consider the context and the nature of the problem being addressed. Without specific details about the problem, it is challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of the statement. However, in general terms:

- If the problem is universally recognized as straightforward and commonly understood to have an easy solution, the claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the problem is known to be complex or subjective, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.
- If the simplicity of the solution is debatable or varies depending on perspective, the claim could be 'Half True'.

Given the lack of context, we cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, we can make a reasoned assumption based on typical scenarios.

"Mientras pagábamos esas tarifas, la producción de gas declinaba",false,es,"While we were paying those fees, gas production was declining.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""While we were paying those fees, gas production was declining,"" we need to consider two main points:

1. **The payment of fees**: We need to establish what fees are being referred to and the timeline during which these fees were paid.
2. **Gas production trends**: We need to verify whether gas production was indeed declining during the same period when the fees were being paid.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is referring to a specific period where fees were paid and gas production data is available for that period, we can make an assessment based on general trends.

If historical data shows that gas production was indeed declining during the period when fees were being paid, the claim would be 'True'. If gas production was fluctuating or not consistently declining, the claim might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'. If gas production was actually increasing, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we can only make a general assessment. Based on typical scenarios where fees might be associated with regulatory or operational costs, and assuming a plausible context where such fees could impact production, we might lean towards a middle-ground assessment.

Le Sénégal compte 1.000 médecins.,false,fr,"Senegal has 1,000 doctors.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Senegal has 1,000 doctors,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available on the number of doctors in Senegal.

According to the World Bank and other health statistics sources, as of recent years, Senegal has had a relatively low doctor-to-population ratio. For instance, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health databases indicate that Senegal has significantly fewer than 1,000 doctors. The exact number can vary, but it is generally reported to be in the range of a few hundred.

Given this information, the claim that Senegal has 1,000 doctors is not supported by the most recent and reliable data.

Lo shock fiscale di Trump ha portato in 13 Stati della confederazione americana la disoccupazione sostanzialmente a tasso zero,half true,it,Trump's fiscal shock has brought unemployment in 13 states of the American confederation to essentially zero.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and the data available regarding unemployment rates in the United States during Trump's presidency.

1. **Fiscal Shock**: This term generally refers to significant changes in government spending or tax policy. During Trump's presidency, there were notable fiscal policies, including tax cuts and increased government spending.

2. **Unemployment Rates**: The term ""essentially zero"" is ambiguous but typically means very low unemployment, often considered to be around 2-3%, as it's practically impossible to have zero unemployment due to natural job turnover and other factors.

3. **State-Level Data**: We need to check if there were indeed 13 states with unemployment rates close to zero during Trump's presidency.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data during Trump's term, while the national unemployment rate did reach historic lows, it did not reach ""essentially zero"" in any state. The lowest state unemployment rates were around 2-3%, but not zero.

Given this information:

- The claim that 13 states had unemployment rates ""essentially zero"" is an exaggeration.
- While unemployment rates were low, they were not at the level implied by the claim.

«Il ministro Gualtieri ha firmato per attivare il Mes»,false,it,'Minister Gualtieri has signed to activate the ESM.',"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Minister Gualtieri has signed to activate the ESM,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Identity of Minister Gualtieri**: Roberto Gualtieri served as the Minister of Economy and Finance in Italy.
2. **ESM**: The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is an intergovernmental organization that provides financial assistance to Eurozone countries experiencing severe financial difficulties.
3. **Action of Signing to Activate the ESM**: This would imply that Minister Gualtieri has taken a formal step to initiate the use of ESM funds or mechanisms.

Given the context, if Minister Gualtieri signed a document or agreement related to the activation of the ESM, the claim would be true. However, if he did not take such an action, the claim would be false.

After reviewing available information, there is no verified record of Minister Gualtieri signing a document to activate the ESM. The ESM's activation typically involves a collective decision by Eurozone finance ministers, not a unilateral action by a single minister.

2. Whether she has been convicted of corruption with public money.
3. Whether she has been sentenced to two years in prison.

Without access to specific and verifiable information about Maria da Saudade Medeiros Braga, it is not possible to confirm or deny the claim definitively. Therefore, based on the lack of verifiable evidence, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Salvini fa il politico da quando Di Maio era in prima elementare?,mostly true,it,Salvini has been a politician since Di Maio was in first grade.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to look at the political careers and ages of Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio.

1. **Matteo Salvini**:
   - Born on March 9, 1973.
   - He became involved in politics at a young age, joining the youth wing of the Northern League (Lega Nord) in 1990.
   - He was elected to the Milan City Council in 1993.

2. **Luigi Di Maio**:
   - Born on July 6, 1986.
   - He would have started first grade around 1992-1993, assuming he started school at the typical age of 6.

Given that Salvini was already involved in politics by joining the Northern League in 1990 and was elected to the Milan City Council in 1993, and considering that Di Maio would have been in first grade around 1992-1993, the claim that ""Salvini has been a politician since Di Maio was in first grade"" is accurate.

"“Después de 10 años de paritarias estábamos en un salario [mínimo docente] que estaba por debajo del mínimo, vital y móvil”",false,es,"""After 10 years of collective bargaining, we were at a [minimum teacher] salary that was below the minimum living wage.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the following:

1. **Context of Collective Bargaining**: The claim states that after 10 years of collective bargaining, the minimum teacher salary was below the minimum living wage. This implies that despite negotiations, the salary did not meet the living wage threshold.

2. **Definition of Minimum Living Wage**: The living wage is typically defined as the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs, which can include housing, food, healthcare, and other essentials. This can vary by location and over time.

3. **Verification of Salary Data**: We would need to compare the minimum teacher salary after 10 years of collective bargaining to the living wage at that time and location. This requires specific data on both the salary and the living wage.

Without specific data to verify the exact figures, we can only assess the plausibility based on general trends and known issues in teacher compensation.

- **General Trends**: It is known that in many regions, teacher salaries have often lagged behind the cost of living increases. Many teachers have reported that their salaries do not meet the living wage, especially in high-cost areas.

Given the general trends and the known issues with teacher compensation, the claim appears plausible but cannot be definitively verified without specific data.

“Somos la única provincia que pierde año a año participación en la renta federal”,true,es,"""We are the only province that loses participation in federal revenue year after year.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""We are the only province that loses participation in federal revenue year after year,"" we need to examine the context and data regarding federal revenue distribution among provinces in the relevant country (presumably Canada).

1. **Federal Revenue Distribution**: Federal revenue distribution can include various forms of transfers such as equalization payments, health transfers, and social transfers. These are typically based on formulas that consider factors like population, fiscal capacity, and specific needs.

2. **Year-over-Year Changes**: The claim suggests a consistent year-over-year decline in participation, implying a trend rather than a one-time occurrence.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: To validate the claim, we need to compare the revenue participation trends of all provinces over multiple years. This involves looking at official government reports and data on federal transfers.

4. **Unique Situation**: The claim asserts uniqueness, meaning no other province experiences a similar trend.

Without specific data and context, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the context is Canada, provinces like Alberta have historically received less in equalization payments due to their higher fiscal capacity, but this does not necessarily mean a year-over-year decline in all forms of federal revenue participation.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, the claim appears to be an oversimplification and may not account for all variables and forms of federal revenue.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
[Lula] Foi o presidente que mais criou universidades,true,pt,'[Lula] was the president who created the most universities.',"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""[Lula] was the president who created the most universities,"" we need to look at the historical data on university creation in Brazil.

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula, served as the President of Brazil from 2003 to 2011. During his administration, there was a significant expansion in higher education, including the creation of new federal universities. According to data from the Brazilian Ministry of Education, Lula's government established several new federal universities and expanded existing ones.

However, to definitively state that he created the most universities compared to all other Brazilian presidents, we would need to compare his record with those of other presidents. For instance, his successor, Dilma Rousseff, also continued the expansion of higher education, and other presidents before him also contributed to the creation of universities.

Based on available data, Lula's administration did indeed create a significant number of universities, but without a comprehensive comparison to all other presidents, it is challenging to assert definitively that he created the most.

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other sources, as of recent years:

1. **Brazil**: Brazil has received a significant number of Venezuelan migrants, but the number is generally reported to be higher than 100,000. For instance, as of 2021, Brazil had received over 260,000 Venezuelan migrants and refugees.

2. **Colombia**: Colombia has received the largest number of Venezuelan migrants. As of 2021, Colombia had received over 1.7 million Venezuelan migrants and refugees.

Given this information, the claim that Brazil received ""less than 100 thousand"" Venezuelans is inaccurate, and the claim that Colombia received ""700 thousand"" is also significantly lower than the actual number.

Voter turnout can be measured in various ways, such as the total number of votes cast, the percentage of eligible voters who participated, or comparisons to previous elections.

1. **Total Number of Votes Cast**: If the election saw the highest number of votes ever cast in the history of that particular election or jurisdiction, the claim could be considered true.
2. **Percentage of Eligible Voters**: If the percentage of eligible voters who participated was the highest ever recorded, the claim could also be considered true.
3. **Comparisons to Previous Elections**: If the turnout was higher than in any previous election, the claim could be considered true.

1. **Research Berlusconi's Statements**: Look for any public statements, interviews, or speeches where Berlusconi has discussed the relationship between apartment thefts and immigration.
2. **Context and Specificity**: Ensure that the statements are specific to apartment thefts and not general crime or other issues.
3. **Credible Sources**: Verify the information from credible news sources, official transcripts, or reliable records.

Without specific evidence or a direct quote from Berlusconi linking apartment thefts to immigration, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if there is no verifiable record of such statements, the claim would be considered false.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the query:

La Tav è parte di un progetto molto più ampio che collega Palermo fino a Kiev,mostly true,it,The high-speed rail is part of a much larger project that connects Palermo to Kiev.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The high-speed rail is part of a much larger project that connects Palermo to Kiev,"" we need to consider the current state of high-speed rail networks in Europe.

1. **High-Speed Rail in Europe**: Europe has an extensive network of high-speed rail lines, but they are primarily concentrated in Western Europe. Countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have well-developed high-speed rail systems.

2. **Palermo**: Palermo is a city in Sicily, Italy. Italy has a high-speed rail network, but it is mainly on the mainland, connecting major cities like Rome, Milan, and Naples. There is no high-speed rail line that directly connects Palermo to the mainland, let alone to other countries.

3. **Kiev**: Kiev (Kyiv) is the capital of Ukraine. Ukraine does have some rail connections to other European countries, but it does not have a high-speed rail network comparable to Western Europe.

4. **Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T)**: The European Union has plans for a Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) which aims to improve and connect transport infrastructure across Europe. However, this is a long-term project and does not currently include a high-speed rail line directly connecting Palermo to Kiev.

Given the current infrastructure and future plans, there is no existing or planned high-speed rail project that directly connects Palermo to Kiev.

“7% del PBI es uno de los mayores déficits de la historia de nuestro país”,half true,es,"""7% of the GDP is one of the largest deficits in the history of our country.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""7% of the GDP is one of the largest deficits in the history of our country,"" we need to consider historical data on the U.S. federal budget deficit as a percentage of GDP.

Historically, the U.S. has experienced varying levels of budget deficits. Some of the largest deficits as a percentage of GDP occurred during significant events such as World War II, the Great Recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example:
- During World War II, the deficit reached over 20% of GDP.
- During the Great Recession (2008-2009), the deficit peaked at around 10% of GDP.
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, the deficit again reached around 15% of GDP in 2020.

Given this context, a deficit of 7% of GDP is indeed significant and among the larger deficits in U.S. history, but it is not the absolute largest. It is substantial enough to be considered one of the larger deficits, though not the largest.

Verdict du procès de Hissène Habre,false,fr,Verdict of the trial of Hissène Habré.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Verdict of the trial of Hissène Habré,"" we need to verify the details of the trial and its outcome.

Hissène Habré, the former President of Chad, was tried and convicted by the Extraordinary African Chambers in Senegal. On May 30, 2016, he was found guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and torture, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Given this information, the claim about the ""Verdict of the trial of Hissène Habré"" is accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
Estamos en uno de los países más cerrados del planeta,true,es,We are in one of the most closed-off countries on the planet.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are in one of the most closed-off countries on the planet,"" we need to consider the context and characteristics of the country in question. A ""closed-off"" country typically refers to one with strict government control over information, limited freedom of movement, restricted access to the internet and foreign media, and stringent regulations on foreign visitors.

Countries often cited as some of the most closed-off include North Korea, Eritrea, Turkmenistan, and sometimes others with similar restrictive policies.

Without specific information about the country being referred to, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if the statement is about a country widely recognized for its extreme isolation and control, such as North Korea, the claim would be accurate.

Given the general nature of the statement and the existence of countries that fit this description, the claim can be considered largely accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"Quando fui secretário aqui em São Paulo, implementei o programa Trabalho Novo, que gerou mais de 2 mil empregos para a população de rua",true,pt,"'When I was secretary here in São Paulo, I implemented the New Work program, which generated more than 2,000 jobs for the homeless population.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. Whether the person making the claim was indeed a secretary in São Paulo.
2. Whether they implemented a program called ""New Work.""
3. Whether this program generated more than 2,000 jobs for the homeless population.

Without specific details or access to verifiable sources, it is challenging to confirm the exact numbers and the effectiveness of the program. However, if we assume the person held the position and the program existed, the claim could be plausible. 

Given the lack of concrete evidence to fully verify each aspect of the claim, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
L'anacarde coûte deux fois moins cher en Côte d'Ivoire dans des pays ouest-africains comme le Burkina Faso.,mostly true,fr,The cashew nut costs half as much in Ivory Coast as in West African countries like Burkina Faso.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The cashew nut costs half as much in Ivory Coast as in West African countries like Burkina Faso,"" we need to consider the available data on cashew nut prices in these regions.

Ivory Coast is one of the largest producers of cashew nuts in the world, and it is plausible that the prices there could be lower due to the high volume of production and lower transportation costs. However, stating that the cost is ""half as much"" is a specific and strong claim that requires precise data to verify.

Without specific and current price data for cashew nuts in both Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, given the general economic and market conditions, it is reasonable to assume that prices could be significantly lower in Ivory Coast, but not necessarily exactly half.

Therefore, based on the information available and the likelihood of significant but not precisely half price differences, the claim can be considered as:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Spread: Italia e Spagna a confronto,true,it,Italy and Spain compared: Spread.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Italy and Spain compared: Spread,"" we need to understand the context and specifics of what is being compared and what ""spread"" refers to. Without additional context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can offer a general analysis based on common comparisons between Italy and Spain.

1. **Geographical Spread**: Italy and Spain are both Southern European countries with significant land areas, but Spain is larger in terms of total land area.
2. **Cultural Spread**: Both countries have rich cultural heritages that have spread globally, influencing art, cuisine, and language.
3. **Economic Spread**: Both countries have diverse economies, but Spain's economy is generally larger in terms of GDP.
4. **Historical Spread**: Both nations have histories of extensive empires that spread their influence across the world.

Given the ambiguity of the term ""spread"" and the lack of specific context, the claim is too vague to be definitively categorized as true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Legenda de vídeo: '[Presidente Bolsonaro,] Não vou falar com você'",false,pt,"'Video caption: '[President Bolsonaro,] I am not going to talk to you''.","To determine the accuracy of the claim in the video caption, we need to verify if there is any evidence or context where someone explicitly says to President Bolsonaro, ""I am not going to talk to you."" This would involve checking reliable sources, news reports, or video footage that captures this exact statement being made to President Bolsonaro.

Without specific evidence or context, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided:

«Tutti questi fondi [del Recovery fund] sono molto più condizionati del Mes» (min. o:56),true,it,"""All these funds [from the Recovery fund] are much more conditional than the Mes"" (min. 0:56).","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""All these funds [from the Recovery fund] are much more conditional than the Mes,"" we need to compare the conditions attached to the Recovery Fund (Next Generation EU) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).

1. **Recovery Fund (Next Generation EU)**:
   - The Recovery Fund, particularly the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), requires member states to submit detailed national recovery and resilience plans. These plans must outline reforms and investments that align with EU priorities, such as the green and digital transitions.
   - Disbursement of funds is conditional on the satisfactory implementation of these plans, with periodic reviews and milestones.

2. **European Stability Mechanism (ESM)**:
   - The ESM provides financial assistance to Eurozone countries experiencing severe financing problems. The conditions for accessing ESM funds typically involve strict economic policy measures and reforms, often negotiated in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
   - The ESM's Pandemic Crisis Support, however, has lighter conditionality, focusing mainly on health-related expenditures without the broader economic reform requirements seen in other ESM programs.

Given this context, the claim that the Recovery Fund is ""much more conditional"" than the ESM is nuanced. While traditional ESM programs have stringent conditions, the specific Pandemic Crisis Support under the ESM has relatively lighter conditions compared to the detailed and milestone-based requirements of the Recovery Fund.

"[A participação do primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, na minha cerimônia de posse] Foi a primeira visita de um chefe de governo israelense ao meu país",true,pt,"[The participation of the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, in my inauguration ceremony] was the first visit of an Israeli head of government to my country.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify if Benjamin Netanyahu's participation in the inauguration ceremony was indeed the first visit of an Israeli head of government to the country in question.

1. Identify the country in question.
2. Check historical records of visits by Israeli heads of government to that country.

Without specific information about the country, I can provide a general approach:

- If the country is one that has had no prior visits from Israeli heads of government, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there have been previous visits by Israeli heads of government, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information about the country, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the country is one that has not had any prior visits from Israeli heads of government, the claim would be 'True'.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
Le Sénégal perd 40 000 hectares de forêt par an.,true,fr,"Senegal loses 40,000 hectares of forest per year.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Senegal loses 40,000 hectares of forest per year,"" we need to look at available data and reports on deforestation in Senegal.

According to various sources, including reports from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other environmental monitoring organizations, Senegal has indeed experienced significant deforestation. The FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment provides data on forest loss, and other environmental reports and studies often cite figures in the range of tens of thousands of hectares per year.

For instance, the FAO's 2020 report indicates that Senegal lost approximately 45,000 hectares of forest annually between 2010 and 2020. This figure is close to the 40,000 hectares mentioned in the claim.

Given this information, the claim that ""Senegal loses 40,000 hectares of forest per year"" is supported by credible data, though the exact figure might slightly vary depending on the source and the specific years considered.

"“En el ‘83 las provincias tenían el 49% de los recursos nacionales, hoy el 26%”",half true,es,"""In '83 the provinces had 49% of national resources, today 26%.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In '83 the provinces had 49% of national resources, today 26%,"" we need to verify historical and current data on the distribution of national resources between the central government and the provinces. This involves looking at official records, economic reports, and credible sources that track the allocation of national resources over time.

1. **Historical Data (1983):**
   - In 1983, the distribution of national resources between the central government and the provinces would have been documented in government financial reports or economic studies from that period. We need to confirm if the provinces indeed had 49% of national resources.

2. **Current Data (Today):**
   - For the current percentage, we need to look at the most recent data on the allocation of national resources. This information is typically available in government budgets, financial reports, or economic analyses.

Without access to specific data sources or verification from credible references, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the claim is accurate and based on verified data, it would be 'True.'
- If the claim is mostly accurate but with minor discrepancies, it would be 'Mostly True.'
- If the claim is partially accurate but with significant inaccuracies, it would be 'Half True.'
- If the claim is mostly inaccurate but with some elements of truth, it would be 'Mostly False.'
- If the claim is entirely inaccurate, it would be 'False.'

Given the lack of specific data verification in this context, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on some level of accurate data, I would tentatively categorize it as 'Half True' pending further verification.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
“Aquí 500 mil chicos al año dejan de estudiar”,true,es,"""Here, 500,000 kids drop out of school every year.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""500,000 kids drop out of school every year,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available on school dropout rates.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States, the dropout rate has been declining over the years. As of the latest data, the number of students who drop out of high school each year is significantly lower than 500,000. For example, in 2018, the NCES reported that the number of high school dropouts was around 2.1 million for individuals aged 16 to 24, but this is a cumulative figure over several years, not an annual dropout rate.

Given this context, the claim that 500,000 kids drop out of school every year appears to be an overestimation based on the most recent data.

Com mais de 100 mil casos [na China],half true,pt,"With more than 100,000 cases [in China].","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""With more than 100,000 cases [in China],"" we need to consider the context and the time frame. As of my last update in October 2023, the number of COVID-19 cases in China has indeed surpassed 100,000. However, the exact number can vary depending on the source and the specific time period being referenced.

Given that the claim is generally accurate but may lack specific details or context, it would be appropriate to classify it as 'Mostly True.'

Quando Renzi e (una parte della) Lega erano contro la Tav,mostly true,it,When Renzi and (a part of) the League were against the TAV.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""When Renzi and (a part of) the League were against the TAV,"" we need to examine the historical positions of Matteo Renzi and the League (Lega Nord) regarding the TAV (Treno Alta Velocità) project, which is a high-speed rail initiative in Italy.

1. **Matteo Renzi**: Matteo Renzi, former Prime Minister of Italy and leader of the Democratic Party (PD), has generally been supportive of infrastructure projects, including the TAV. During his tenure, he promoted modernization and development projects. Therefore, it is unlikely that Renzi was against the TAV.

2. **The League (Lega Nord)**: The League has had a more complex stance on the TAV. Historically, the party has had factions with differing views. Some members, particularly those from regions that would benefit from the TAV, have supported it, while others, especially those concerned with environmental and local issues, have opposed it. This internal division means that it is plausible that ""a part of"" the League was against the TAV at some point.

Given this context, the claim that Renzi was against the TAV is inaccurate, while the claim that a part of the League was against it is plausible.

Un constituionnaliste français démontre la légalité de la candidature d'Alassane Ouattara,false,fr,A French constitutional expert demonstrates the legality of Alassane Ouattara's candidacy.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""A French constitutional expert demonstrates the legality of Alassane Ouattara's candidacy,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Expert Opinion**: The claim hinges on the opinion of a French constitutional expert. If such an expert has indeed provided a legal analysis supporting Ouattara's candidacy, this part of the claim could be considered true.

2. **Legality**: The legality of a candidacy is typically determined by the constitutional and legal framework of the country in question, in this case, Côte d'Ivoire. The opinion of a French expert, while potentially influential, is not the final arbiter of legality in Côte d'Ivoire.

3. **Context**: Alassane Ouattara's candidacy has been a subject of controversy, particularly regarding term limits and constitutional interpretations within Côte d'Ivoire. The local legal and political context is crucial in assessing the overall legality.

Given these points, the claim can be seen as presenting a specific perspective (that of a French constitutional expert) rather than an absolute legal determination. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but is also not fully conclusive about the legality in the Ivorian context.

Boschi imprecisa sui risultati della lotta all'evasione fiscale,half true,it,Boschi is imprecise about the results of the fight against tax evasion.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Boschi is imprecise about the results of the fight against tax evasion,"" we need to evaluate the context and evidence regarding Boschi's statements on this topic. If Boschi's statements lack specific details, data, or clear outcomes, then the claim would be more accurate. Conversely, if Boschi provides detailed and precise information, the claim would be less accurate.

Given that the claim suggests a lack of precision, and without specific evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is at least partially accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
“Codice rosso” per i reati sessuali: già in vigore o novità?,half true,it,'“Red code” for sexual crimes: already in force or new?',"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Red code for sexual crimes: already in force or new?"", we need to consider the context and the specific details of the ""Red code"" being referred to. 

1. **Definition and Context**: The term ""Red code"" could refer to a specific legal or procedural framework designed to address sexual crimes. This could be a new initiative or an existing one that has been recently highlighted or modified.

2. **Verification**: 
   - If the ""Red code"" is a new initiative, then the claim would be ""new"".
   - If the ""Red code"" has been in force for some time, then the claim would be ""already in force"".

3. **Research**: Without specific details or a clear reference to a particular jurisdiction or legal framework, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the ""Red code"" is a recent development or a newly implemented measure, the claim would lean towards being ""new"".

Given the ambiguity and the need for more specific information, the most balanced assessment would be:

Le Nigeria est le pays qui compte le plus de filles non scolaraisées dans le monde.,mostly true,fr,Nigeria is the country with the highest number of out-of-school girls in the world.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Nigeria is the country with the highest number of out-of-school girls in the world,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available from sources such as UNESCO, UNICEF, and other reputable organizations that track global education statistics.

According to UNESCO and UNICEF reports, Nigeria has consistently been highlighted as having one of the highest numbers of out-of-school children, particularly girls. Various reports and data sets from these organizations indicate that Nigeria has a significant issue with girls' education, with millions of girls not attending school due to various factors such as poverty, cultural practices, and insecurity.

Given this information, the claim appears to be well-supported by credible sources.

Conte ha ragione sui rapporti economici tra Italia e Mozambico,true,it,Conte is right about the economic relations between Italy and Mozambique.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Conte is right about the economic relations between Italy and Mozambique,"" we need to evaluate the context and specifics of what Conte has said about these economic relations. Without the exact statement or context provided, it is challenging to assess the claim accurately.

However, I can provide some general information about the economic relations between Italy and Mozambique. Italy and Mozambique have had diplomatic and economic relations for many years. Italy has been involved in various development projects in Mozambique, particularly in areas such as infrastructure, energy, and agriculture. Italian companies have also invested in Mozambique, especially in the natural gas sector.

Given this general background, if Conte's statement aligns with the established economic interactions and investments between the two countries, it could be considered accurate. Conversely, if Conte's statement exaggerates or misrepresents these relations, it would be less accurate.

Since the specific statement by Conte is not provided, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. Therefore, I must refrain from making a final judgment.

The population doubling time can be estimated using the Rule of 70, which states that the doubling time in years is approximately equal to 70 divided by the annual growth rate percentage.

As of recent data, Senegal's population growth rate is around 2.7% per year. Using the Rule of 70:

Doubling time = 70 / 2.7 ≈ 25.9 years

This calculation suggests that the population doubling time is close to 25 years, but not exactly. Therefore, the claim is not entirely precise but is very close to the actual estimate.

1. **Salvini's Public Statements**: Matteo Salvini, leader of the League party in Italy, has often expressed skepticism about certain environmental policies, particularly those he perceives as economically detrimental or overly restrictive.

2. **Voting Record**: Salvini's voting record in the European Parliament can be checked to see if he has consistently voted against environmental protection measures. This includes votes on climate change policies, renewable energy initiatives, and other environmental regulations.

3. **Context of the Claim**: The claim suggests a contradiction between Salvini's public concern about an ""emergency"" (presumably environmental or related to climate change) and his voting behavior in Brussels.

Based on available information, Salvini has indeed voted against several key environmental measures in the European Parliament. For example, he has opposed stricter emissions targets and other regulations aimed at combating climate change. This aligns with the claim that he has voted against measures to protect the environment.

1. **Initial Position**: Early in the pandemic, the WHO did not explicitly recommend widespread lockdowns as the primary measure to combat the virus. Instead, they emphasized testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine.

2. **Evolving Guidance**: As the situation evolved, the WHO acknowledged that lockdowns could be necessary in certain situations to control the spread of the virus, especially when other measures were insufficient or overwhelmed.

3. **Statements from WHO Officials**: Various WHO officials, including Dr. Mike Ryan and Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, have made statements suggesting that lockdowns should be a last resort and not the primary tool for controlling the virus. They have highlighted the significant social and economic impacts of lockdowns.

Given this context, the claim that the WHO ""never advised the implementation of lockdowns"" is not entirely accurate. While the WHO did not initially advocate for lockdowns as the primary measure, they did recognize their potential necessity in certain circumstances.

Renzi poco chiaro sul ritorno a Maastricht,half true,it,Renzi unclear about the return to Maastricht.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Renzi unclear about the return to Maastricht,"" we need to consider the context and available information about Matteo Renzi's statements or actions regarding the Maastricht Treaty or related policies.

1. **Context**: The Maastricht Treaty, formally known as the Treaty on European Union, was signed in 1992 and laid the foundation for the modern European Union and the euro currency. Discussions about ""returning to Maastricht"" typically refer to adhering to the treaty's fiscal rules, such as the deficit and debt limits.

2. **Renzi's Position**: Matteo Renzi, the former Prime Minister of Italy, has had various public statements and policy positions regarding the European Union's fiscal rules. If Renzi has made ambiguous or contradictory statements about adhering to the Maastricht criteria, the claim could be considered accurate. Conversely, if he has been clear and consistent, the claim would be inaccurate.

3. **Evidence**: To accurately assess the claim, we would need specific examples of Renzi's statements or policy actions. If there is evidence of ambiguity or lack of clarity in his position on the Maastricht criteria, the claim could be considered ""True"" or ""Mostly True."" If his position has been clear, the claim would be ""False"" or ""Mostly False.""

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, we can only make a general assessment based on known information about Renzi's political stance and public statements.

“[Entre 2003 y 2011] creamos 300 mil empleos”,false,es,"""[Between 2003 and 2011] we created 300,000 jobs.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Between 2003 and 2011 we created 300,000 jobs,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Who is making the claim? Is it a government official, a company, or an independent organization? The credibility of the source can impact the reliability of the claim.

2. **Data Verification**: Are there official employment statistics or reports from reputable sources (such as government labor departments, economic research institutions, or independent analysts) that confirm the creation of 300,000 jobs during this period?

3. **Context**: What is the context of the job creation? Is it within a specific industry, region, or country? The context can help narrow down the data needed to verify the claim.

4. **Economic Conditions**: What were the economic conditions between 2003 and 2011? Were there significant events (such as economic booms or recessions) that could have influenced job creation?

Without specific details about the source and context of the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is made by a credible source and there is supporting data from reputable sources, we can make an informed judgment.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim provided, I will base my assessment on the general economic trends and available data from that period.

**General Economic Trends (2003-2011)**:
- The early 2000s saw economic growth and job creation in many regions.
- The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 led to significant job losses, but recovery efforts in the following years aimed to restore employment levels.

Considering these factors, it is plausible that 300,000 jobs could have been created during this period, but the accuracy of the claim would depend on the specific context and data.

Six cent femmes ont perdu la vie lors des accouchements au Sénégal depuis le #Covid19sn,half true,fr,Six hundred women have lost their lives during childbirth in Senegal since the #Covid19sn.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Six hundred women have lost their lives during childbirth in Senegal since the #Covid19sn,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Data Verification**: Check the available data on maternal mortality in Senegal during the COVID-19 pandemic period.
2. **Source Credibility**: Evaluate the credibility of the sources providing this information.
3. **Contextual Factors**: Consider the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare systems and maternal health services in Senegal.

### Data Verification
- According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health monitoring organizations, maternal mortality rates can be influenced by various factors, including healthcare access, quality of care, and systemic challenges exacerbated by the pandemic.
- Specific data on maternal deaths directly attributed to the COVID-19 period in Senegal would be necessary to confirm the exact number.

### Source Credibility
- If the claim is made by a reputable health organization or a government health department, it would carry more weight.
- Social media hashtags like #Covid19sn may not always be reliable sources unless backed by verified data.

### Contextual Factors
- The COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare systems worldwide, potentially leading to increased maternal mortality due to reduced access to care, overwhelmed health facilities, and other indirect effects.

### Conclusion
Without specific, verified data from credible sources, it is challenging to confirm the exact number of maternal deaths. However, given the known impact of the pandemic on healthcare systems, it is plausible that maternal mortality could have increased.

“Aumentamos 100% los montos que enviamos a los comedores escolares”,mostly true,es,"""We increased the amounts we send to school cafeterias by 100%.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We increased the amounts we send to school cafeterias by 100%,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Definition of 100% Increase**: A 100% increase means that the amount sent to school cafeterias has doubled. For example, if the original amount was $1,000, a 100% increase would mean the new amount is $2,000.

2. **Verification of Data**: We would need to verify the actual amounts sent to school cafeterias before and after the claimed increase. This involves checking financial records or official reports that detail the funding or resources allocated to school cafeterias.

Without specific data to verify the claim, we can only assess the statement based on the definition of a 100% increase. If the statement aligns with the definition and there is no contradictory evidence, it can be considered accurate.

Given the information provided and assuming the claim is made based on accurate data, the statement would be:

"Les responsables de ce parti investis sur des listes rivales perdront leur mandat de députés, s’ils sont élus au soir du 31 juillet 2017, conformément à la loi.",false,fr,"The officials of this party who are placed on rival lists will lose their mandate as deputies if they are elected on the evening of July 31, 2017, in accordance with the law.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. **Existence of a Law**: Is there a law that mandates officials of a party to lose their mandate as deputies if they are placed on rival lists and elected?
2. **Date Specificity**: Does this law specifically apply to elections held on the evening of July 31, 2017?

Without specific information about the legal framework in place at that time and location, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, the specificity of the date and the nature of the claim suggest that it might be referencing a particular legal or electoral context.

Given the lack of detailed information to confirm the existence of such a law and its application to the specified date, the claim cannot be fully verified.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
“[Neuquén] tiene los mejores indicadores económicos y sociales del país”,half true,es,"""[Neuquén] has the best economic and social indicators in the country.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""[Neuquén] has the best economic and social indicators in the country,"" we need to evaluate various economic and social indicators such as GDP per capita, employment rates, poverty rates, education levels, healthcare quality, and overall quality of life in Neuquén compared to other provinces in Argentina.

1. **Economic Indicators:**
   - **GDP per capita:** Neuquén is known for its significant oil and gas production, particularly from the Vaca Muerta shale formation, which contributes positively to its GDP per capita.
   - **Employment Rates:** The province has relatively high employment rates due to the energy sector, but this can fluctuate with global oil prices.
   - **Poverty Rates:** While Neuquén has lower poverty rates compared to some other provinces, it is not necessarily the lowest in the country.

2. **Social Indicators:**
   - **Education Levels:** Neuquén has a decent education system, but it is not universally recognized as the best in Argentina.
   - **Healthcare Quality:** The healthcare system in Neuquén is relatively good, but again, it is not necessarily the best in the country.
   - **Quality of Life:** Neuquén offers a good quality of life, but this is subjective and varies depending on individual preferences and needs.

Given that Neuquén performs well in several economic and social indicators but does not consistently rank as the best across all categories, the claim is somewhat exaggerated.

“Los sectores más desprotegidos son los que más sufren los efectos del cambio climático”,true,es,"""The most vulnerable sectors are the ones that suffer the most from the effects of climate change.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the impact of climate change on various sectors and identify which ones are most vulnerable.

1. **Agriculture**: This sector is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its dependence on weather conditions. Changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and the frequency of extreme weather events can significantly affect crop yields and livestock.

2. **Fisheries and Aquaculture**: These sectors are also vulnerable as they depend on stable marine and freshwater ecosystems. Climate change can lead to ocean acidification, changes in water temperature, and altered fish migration patterns, all of which can impact fish stocks.

3. **Forestry**: Forests are susceptible to climate change through increased risks of wildfires, pest infestations, and diseases, which can be exacerbated by changing climate conditions.

4. **Tourism**: Particularly in regions dependent on natural attractions (e.g., coral reefs, ski resorts), climate change can reduce the attractiveness of these destinations, impacting local economies.

5. **Health**: Public health can be affected by climate change through increased heatwaves, the spread of vector-borne diseases, and the health impacts of extreme weather events.

6. **Infrastructure**: Coastal and low-lying areas are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise and increased frequency of extreme weather events, which can damage infrastructure and disrupt services.

Given these points, it is clear that the most vulnerable sectors indeed suffer significantly from the effects of climate change. However, the degree of suffering can vary based on location, adaptive capacity, and other factors.

"“Desde la crisis hasta hoy el salario básico del sector industrial subió 10 veces, [mientras que] la inflación (…) subió seis veces”",mostly true,es,"""Since the crisis until today, the basic salary in the industrial sector has increased tenfold, while inflation has increased sixfold.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The increase in the basic salary in the industrial sector since the crisis.
2. The increase in inflation since the crisis.

If the basic salary in the industrial sector has indeed increased tenfold and inflation has increased sixfold, the claim would be 'True'. If the increases are close but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the increases are significantly different, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data to verify these points, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on some factual data, we can make an educated guess.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Mais escolaridade não significa, no Brasil, mais produtividade",true,pt,"More schooling does not mean, in Brazil, more productivity.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""More schooling does not mean, in Brazil, more productivity,"" we need to consider the relationship between education and productivity in Brazil.

1. **Education Quality**: In Brazil, the quality of education varies significantly. While more schooling generally leads to better job opportunities and higher wages, the quality of education can impact productivity. If the education system is not effective in imparting relevant skills, more years of schooling may not translate into higher productivity.

2. **Economic Context**: Brazil's economy has structural issues that can affect productivity. Factors such as infrastructure, technology, and business environment also play crucial roles in productivity. Even with more schooling, if these factors are not conducive, productivity gains may be limited.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Studies and reports on Brazil's education system and labor market suggest that while there is a positive correlation between education and productivity, the impact is not as strong as in some other countries due to the aforementioned issues.

Given these points, the claim has some validity but is not entirely accurate. More schooling does generally lead to higher productivity, but the effect is moderated by the quality of education and other economic factors.

35% des Sénégalaises sont mariées avant d'atteindre la majorité requise de 18 ans.,half true,fr,35% of Senegalese women are married before reaching the legal age of 18.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""35% of Senegalese women are married before reaching the legal age of 18,"" we need to refer to reliable sources such as reports from international organizations like UNICEF, the World Bank, or other reputable entities that track child marriage statistics.

According to UNICEF data, child marriage is a significant issue in Senegal. As of recent reports, approximately 31% of women aged 20-24 were married before the age of 18. This figure is close to the 35% mentioned in the claim but not exactly the same.

Given that the claim is slightly higher than the reported statistic but still within a reasonable range, it can be considered mostly accurate but not entirely precise.

"Nós inauguramos duas Casas (da Mulher), que tratam da violência contra a mulher. Uma em Bangu, outra em Madureira",mostly true,pt,"We inaugurated two Women's Houses, which address violence against women. One in Bangu, another in Madureira.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify if two Women's Houses addressing violence against women were indeed inaugurated in Bangu and Madureira. This involves checking credible sources such as government announcements, news reports, or official records.

If the claim is fully supported by evidence from reliable sources, it would be 'True'. If there are minor inaccuracies or missing details, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the claim is partially correct but lacks significant details or context, it would be 'Half True'. If the claim has some elements of truth but is mostly incorrect, it would be 'Mostly False'. If the claim is entirely unsupported or incorrect, it would be 'False'.

Without access to the specific verification details, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the question, I will assume the need for a hypothetical evaluation.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Vive l'Expo!,true,it,Long live the Expo!,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Long live the Expo!"", we need to consider the context and the nature of the statement. The phrase ""Long live"" is typically an expression of support or a wish for longevity and success. It is not a factual statement that can be verified or disproven in a traditional sense. Instead, it is more of a subjective or aspirational statement.

Given that it is an expression of support rather than a factual claim, it cannot be classified as 'True' or 'False' in the conventional sense. However, if we interpret it as a sentiment or a cheer for the Expo, it could be seen as 'True' in the context of expressing a positive wish.

"Molecada de 15 anos de idade, 70% não sabe uma regra de três simples",true,pt,"Teenagers aged 15, 70% do not know how to solve a basic proportion problem.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Teenagers aged 15, 70% do not know how to solve a basic proportion problem,"" we need to consider available data and research on the mathematical proficiency of teenagers, particularly in solving proportion problems.

1. **Research and Data**: Studies such as those conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) or international assessments like the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) provide insights into the mathematical abilities of teenagers. These assessments often include questions on basic mathematical concepts, including proportions.

2. **Proficiency Levels**: According to various educational assessments, a significant percentage of students struggle with basic mathematical concepts, including proportions. However, the exact percentage can vary based on the sample size, demographic, and the specific nature of the problems assessed.

3. **Interpretation of Data**: If we consider the PISA 2018 results, for example, many students around the age of 15 do struggle with mathematics, but the exact percentage who cannot solve a basic proportion problem might not be precisely 70%. It could be higher or lower depending on the specific context and definition of ""basic proportion problem.""

Given the variability in data and the lack of a specific source for the 70% figure, the claim might be an overgeneralization or an approximation based on broader trends in mathematical proficiency.

É raro que um presidente da Câmara tenha seu mandato de deputado federal cassado?,true,pt,Is it rare for a Speaker of the House to have their term as a federal deputy revoked?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that it is rare for a Speaker of the House to have their term as a federal deputy revoked, we need to consider historical precedents and the typical stability of the position.

1. **Historical Context**: The Speaker of the House is a high-ranking and influential position within the legislative branch. Historically, Speakers of the House in various countries, including the United States, have generally maintained their positions unless involved in significant scandals or legal issues.

2. **Frequency of Revocation**: The revocation of a federal deputy's term, especially one who holds the position of Speaker, is not a common occurrence. It typically requires substantial legal or ethical violations, and the process involves multiple steps, including investigations and votes.

3. **Examples**: While there have been instances where Speakers have faced legal challenges or ethical controversies, the actual revocation of their term as a federal deputy is rare. Most often, they may resign or be pressured to step down rather than having their term formally revoked.

Given this context, the claim that it is rare for a Speaker of the House to have their term as a federal deputy revoked is supported by historical evidence and the procedural difficulty of such an action.

"“Las mujeres jóvenes, hoy en día, duplican en términos de desempleo al desempleo general del país”",true,es,"""Young women, nowadays, have double the unemployment rate compared to the general unemployment rate of the country.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Young women, nowadays, have double the unemployment rate compared to the general unemployment rate of the country,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Current Unemployment Rates**: We need the most recent data on the general unemployment rate and the unemployment rate for young women.
2. **Comparison**: We need to compare these two rates to see if the unemployment rate for young women is indeed double the general unemployment rate.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, historically, youth unemployment rates (including young women) tend to be higher than the general unemployment rate. Whether it is exactly double can vary by country and over time.

Given the general trend that youth unemployment is higher but not necessarily double, the claim might be an exaggeration.

"«Conte ha deciso di chiudere la Lombardia con i dati della settimana scorsa, che equivalgono alla situazione epidemiologica di due settimane fa»",mostly true,it,"""Conte decided to close Lombardy based on last week's data, which corresponds to the epidemiological situation from two weeks ago.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the components:

1. **Conte decided to close Lombardy**: This refers to a decision made by Giuseppe Conte, the Prime Minister of Italy, to impose restrictions or a lockdown in the Lombardy region.

2. **Based on last week's data**: This implies that the decision was made using data that was available from the previous week.

3. **Which corresponds to the epidemiological situation from two weeks ago**: This suggests that the data from last week reflects the situation as it was two weeks prior, due to the time it takes to collect, process, and report epidemiological data.

Given the nature of epidemiological data collection and reporting, it is common for there to be a lag between the actual situation and the reported data. Decisions are often made based on the most recent data available, which may indeed reflect the situation from a week or two prior.

Therefore, the claim that Conte decided to close Lombardy based on last week's data, which corresponds to the epidemiological situation from two weeks ago, aligns with standard practices in public health decision-making.

"Se nós aprovarmos a (PEC) 241, nós não precisamos pensar em tributo, porque, convenhamos, a carga tributária chegou ao seu limite",half true,pt,"'If we approve the (PEC) 241, we don't need to think about taxes, because, let's face it, the tax burden has reached its limit.'","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and implications of PEC 241 (Proposta de Emenda à Constituição 241) and the statement about the tax burden.

PEC 241, also known as the ""Expenditure Ceiling Amendment,"" was a constitutional amendment proposed in Brazil to limit public spending growth to the rate of inflation for the next 20 years. The goal was to control public debt and create a more sustainable fiscal policy.

The claim suggests that if PEC 241 is approved, there would be no need to think about taxes because the tax burden has reached its limit. This statement can be analyzed from several angles:

1. **Fiscal Policy and Spending Control**: PEC 241 aims to control public spending, but it does not directly address tax policy. While controlling spending can help manage public debt, it does not eliminate the need for tax revenue to fund government operations and services.

2. **Tax Burden**: The assertion that the tax burden has reached its limit is subjective and can vary depending on economic conditions, public opinion, and government needs. Some may argue that the tax burden is high, while others may see room for adjustments.

3. **Long-term Fiscal Health**: Even with spending controls, governments may still need to adjust tax policies to respond to economic changes, fund new initiatives, or address unforeseen financial challenges.

Given these points, the claim oversimplifies the relationship between spending controls and tax policy. While PEC 241 may help manage public spending, it does not eliminate the need to consider tax policies in the broader context of fiscal health.

"De cada $100 que los misioneros pagan de impuestos, $76 se los lleva Cristina",mostly true,es,"Out of every $100 that the people of Misiones pay in taxes, $76 goes to Cristina.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Out of every $100 that the people of Misiones pay in taxes, $76 goes to Cristina,"" we need to evaluate the context and the specifics of the tax distribution in Misiones, Argentina.

1. **Tax Distribution**: In Argentina, tax revenue is typically distributed among various levels of government, including federal, provincial, and municipal levels. The claim suggests that a significant portion of the taxes paid by the people of Misiones is directed to Cristina, presumably referring to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a prominent political figure in Argentina.

2. **Federal Allocation**: If the claim implies that $76 out of every $100 in taxes goes to the federal government, where Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has influence, it would still be an exaggeration. The federal government does receive a portion of the taxes, but it is not as high as 76%.

3. **Provincial and Municipal Taxes**: A substantial portion of taxes collected in Misiones would stay within the province and municipalities for local governance and services.

4. **Specific Allocation to Cristina**: The claim directly associates the tax revenue with Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, which is misleading. Tax revenue is allocated to various government functions and not directly to an individual.

Given these points, the claim appears to be a significant exaggeration and misrepresentation of how tax revenue is distributed and used.

Given the information provided, I cannot independently verify the exact amount allocated by the Ivorian government for the fight against HIV/AIDS during the specified period. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data from a reliable source, it would be reasonable to consider it as 'True'.

«Abbiamo trovato un’Italia con 10 milioni di poveri. Con il tasso di disoccupazione più alto d’Europa».,half true,it,"""We found an Italy with 10 million poor people. With the highest unemployment rate in Europe.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points: the number of poor people in Italy and the unemployment rate in comparison to other European countries.

1. **Number of Poor People in Italy**:
   - According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), the number of people living in absolute poverty in Italy was around 5.6 million in 2021. If we consider relative poverty, the number might be higher, but it is unlikely to reach 10 million.

2. **Unemployment Rate in Europe**:
   - As of recent data, Italy's unemployment rate is high but not the highest in Europe. Countries like Spain and Greece have higher unemployment rates.

Given these points, the claim that Italy has 10 million poor people is an overestimation, and the statement about having the highest unemployment rate in Europe is incorrect.

"“En San Luis, hemos logrado el pleno empleo”",true,es,"""In San Luis, we have achieved full employment.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In San Luis, we have achieved full employment,"" we need to understand what ""full employment"" means and verify the employment data for San Luis.

""Full employment"" is an economic condition where all available labor resources are being used in the most efficient way possible. It does not mean zero unemployment but rather a very low level of unemployment, typically around 4-5%, which accounts for frictional unemployment (people transitioning between jobs).

To assess the claim, we would need the latest employment statistics for San Luis. If the unemployment rate in San Luis is within the range typically considered full employment (around 4-5%), the claim could be considered 'Mostly True'. If the rate is slightly higher but still low, it might be 'Half True'. If the rate is significantly higher, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data, we cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and recent data, we can make an educated guess.

Le droit de sol existait en côte d'ivoire en janvier 1972.,true,fr,The right of soil existed in Ivory Coast in January 1972.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The right of soil existed in Ivory Coast in January 1972,"" we need to understand the concept of ""right of soil"" (jus soli) and its application in Ivory Coast during that time.

Jus soli refers to the right of anyone born in the territory of a state to nationality or citizenship. In the context of Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire), the country's nationality laws have evolved over time.

Ivory Coast gained independence from France in 1960. The nationality laws in place at the time of independence and in the subsequent years were influenced by French law but were also adapted to the specific context of the new nation.

In 1961, Ivory Coast adopted its first nationality code, which included elements of both jus soli and jus sanguinis (right of blood). According to this code, a child born in Ivory Coast to at least one parent who was also born in Ivory Coast could acquire Ivorian nationality. This indicates that a form of jus soli was indeed recognized.

Given that the nationality code of 1961 was still in effect in January 1972, it is accurate to say that the right of soil (jus soli) existed in Ivory Coast at that time, albeit with specific conditions.

“En la Ciudad la mitad de los trabajadores son de la Provincia”,true,es,"""In the City, half of the workers are from the Province.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In the City, half of the workers are from the Province,"" we need to evaluate the available data or context regarding the workforce composition in the City and the Province. 

If we assume that ""the City"" refers to a specific urban area and ""the Province"" refers to a larger administrative region that includes the City, the claim would be evaluated based on the proportion of workers in the City who originate from the Province.

Without specific data, we can only make a general assessment. If the claim is based on a reliable source or statistical data indicating that approximately 50% of the workers in the City are indeed from the Province, then the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows a slightly different proportion but still close to 50%, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the proportion is significantly different, the claim could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on the degree of discrepancy.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, the most cautious and reasonable assessment without further information would be:

Affinità e divergenze tra Farage e Grillo in Europa,true,it,Affinities and divergences between Farage and Grillo in Europe.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Affinities and divergences between Farage and Grillo in Europe,"" we need to examine the political positions and actions of Nigel Farage and Beppe Grillo.

Nigel Farage is a British politician known for his leadership in the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and his role in advocating for Brexit. His political stance is characterized by strong Euroscepticism, anti-immigration policies, and a focus on national sovereignty.

Beppe Grillo is an Italian comedian and politician who co-founded the Five Star Movement (M5S). The M5S is known for its anti-establishment stance, direct democracy advocacy, and environmental policies. While the movement also exhibits Euroscepticism, it is generally more left-leaning compared to Farage's right-leaning positions.

**Affinities:**
1. **Euroscepticism:** Both Farage and Grillo share a critical view of the European Union and advocate for greater national sovereignty.
2. **Anti-establishment:** Both figures position themselves against traditional political elites and mainstream parties.

**Divergences:**
1. **Political Spectrum:** Farage is right-leaning, focusing on issues like immigration control and free-market policies, while Grillo's M5S has a more mixed or left-leaning stance, emphasizing environmentalism and social welfare.
2. **Policy Focus:** Farage's policies are more focused on national sovereignty and economic liberalism, whereas Grillo's M5S includes a broader range of issues like environmental sustainability and direct democracy.

Given these points, the claim that there are both affinities and divergences between Farage and Grillo in Europe is accurate.

   - According to data from the Brazilian government, millions of people across Brazil received emergency aid during the COVID-19 pandemic. São Paulo, being the most populous state, had a significant number of beneficiaries. However, specific numbers for São Paulo city alone can be harder to pinpoint without the latest official statistics.

2. **Change in Emergency Aid Amount:**
   - Initially, the Brazilian government provided an emergency aid of R$ 600 per month to help people during the pandemic. Later, this amount was reduced to R$ 300.

Given these points, the claim that 2.7 million people in São Paulo are living on the reduced emergency aid amount of R$ 300 seems plausible but requires precise data to confirm the exact number of beneficiaries in São Paulo city.

**Evaluation:**
- The reduction in aid from R$ 600 to R$ 300 is accurate.
- The number of people (2.7 million) in São Paulo living on this aid is a significant figure that aligns with the high population and economic challenges faced during the pandemic, but it is difficult to verify the exact number without specific data.

**Conclusion:**
The claim is generally accurate regarding the reduction in aid but may not be fully precise about the exact number of beneficiaries in São Paulo city.

"Posti guadagnati, posti persi: i numeri di Salvini sull’occupazione Usa",mostly true,it,"'Jobs gained, jobs lost: Salvini's numbers on U.S. employment'.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Jobs gained, jobs lost: Salvini's numbers on U.S. employment,"" we need to evaluate the specific numbers and context provided by Salvini regarding U.S. employment. This involves checking the data against reliable sources such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and other reputable economic reports.

Without the specific numbers and context provided by Salvini, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that Salvini's numbers are being scrutinized for accuracy, we would need to compare them to the official employment statistics.

If Salvini's numbers align closely with the official data, the claim could be rated as 'True' or 'Mostly True.' If there are some discrepancies but the overall trend is correct, it might be 'Half True.' Significant inaccuracies or misleading interpretations would lead to a rating of 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Given the lack of specific details in the claim provided, I cannot definitively verify the accuracy of Salvini's numbers on U.S. employment.

1. **Reduction in Number of Secretariats and Agencies**: The claim states a reduction from 29 to around 15. This is a specific numerical change that can be verified by comparing the current and proposed numbers of secretariats and agencies.

2. **Significant Savings in Administrative Expenses**: The claim suggests that this reduction will lead to significant savings. This can be assessed by looking at budget reports or financial statements that show the cost savings from reducing the number of secretariats and agencies.

3. **More Agility in Decision-Making Processes**: The claim also asserts that this reduction will provide more agility in decision-making. This is a qualitative assessment that can be supported by expert opinions, case studies, or examples from other cities that have undergone similar restructuring.

Without specific data or evidence to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the reduction in the number of secretariats and agencies is accurately reported and that such a reduction typically leads to cost savings and improved decision-making efficiency, we can make an informed judgment.

Given the information provided and the typical outcomes of such administrative changes, the claim appears to be plausible but not fully verifiable without additional data.

"No, lo spread non è tornato ai livelli precedenti al governo",false,it,"No, the spread has not returned to the levels prior to the government.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""No, the spread has not returned to the levels prior to the government,"" we need to understand the context and the specific data being referred to. The term ""spread"" could refer to various metrics such as financial spreads (e.g., bond yield spreads), disease spread, or other types of spreads. Additionally, ""prior to the government"" needs clarification—does it mean before a specific government action, policy, or administration?

Without additional context or specific data, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is about a financial spread and that there is data showing that the spread has indeed not returned to pre-government intervention levels, then the claim could be accurate.

Given the lack of specific context and data, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Il lavoro è meno precario?,half true,it,Is work less precarious?,"To determine whether the claim ""Is work less precarious?"" is accurate, we need to consider various factors such as job security, employment contracts, benefits, and economic conditions. 

In recent years, there has been a rise in gig economy jobs, freelance work, and short-term contracts, which can make work more precarious for many individuals. However, some sectors and regions may have seen improvements in job security and working conditions due to stronger labor laws, unionization, and economic growth.

Given the mixed nature of these trends, the claim that work is less precarious cannot be universally applied. It may be true in some contexts and false in others.

En este gobierno se duplicó la pobreza y la falta de trabajo,false,es,"In this government, poverty and unemployment have doubled.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In this government, poverty and unemployment have doubled,"" we need to evaluate the available data and context regarding poverty and unemployment rates during the tenure of the current government.

1. **Poverty Rates**: We need to examine official statistics or credible reports on poverty rates at the beginning of the current government's term and compare them to the most recent data. If the poverty rate has indeed doubled, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Unemployment Rates**: Similarly, we need to look at the unemployment rates at the start of the current government's term and compare them to the latest figures. If the unemployment rate has doubled, this part of the claim would be true.

3. **Context and Time Frame**: It's important to consider the time frame and any significant events (e.g., economic crises, pandemics) that might have influenced these rates. 

Without specific data, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some exaggeration or misinterpretation of data, it might not be entirely accurate.

Given the need for precise data to make a definitive judgment, and assuming that such a dramatic change is unlikely without significant evidence, the claim is likely exaggerated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Il nuovo record della disoccupazione giovanile?,half true,it,'The new record of youth unemployment?',"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The new record of youth unemployment,"" we need to consider the context and the specific data being referenced. Youth unemployment rates can vary significantly by country, region, and time period. Additionally, the term ""new record"" implies that the current rate is the highest it has ever been.

To accurately assess this claim, we would need to:

1. Identify the specific region or country being referenced.
2. Obtain the most recent youth unemployment statistics for that region or country.
3. Compare these statistics to historical data to determine if the current rate is indeed a new record.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent trends and data, we can make an educated guess.

Given the global economic impact of events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, many regions have experienced significant fluctuations in unemployment rates, including youth unemployment. It is plausible that some regions may have reached new records in youth unemployment.

1. The growth rate of 6.6% in 2016.
2. Whether it is the first time since 1980 that the country has consecutively reached the 6% growth mark for three years.

Without specific data on the country's economic growth rates for the years in question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate, we can analyze the statement based on the information given.

1. If the country indeed had a growth rate of 6.6% in 2016, this part of the claim would be true.
2. If it is true that this is the first time since 1980 that the country has consecutively reached the 6% growth mark for three years, this part of the claim would also be true.

If the verified cost aligns closely with the stated amount of 568 billion francs excluding taxes, the claim would be considered 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies, it might be 'Mostly True'. Significant differences would lead to a rating of 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on the extent of the discrepancy.

Given that I do not have access to real-time data or the ability to verify the claim directly, I cannot definitively categorize the statement.

1. **Salvini**: Matteo Salvini is an Italian politician, leader of the League party, and has served in various governmental roles, including Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior.

2. **Turkey**: This refers to the country, which has its own political dynamics and issues, including those related to women's rights and gender equality.

3. **Women**: This could refer to women's rights, gender equality, or specific incidents involving women.

To assess the claim, we need to see if there is a notable event, statement, or policy that involves Salvini, Turkey, and women.

- **Salvini's Stance on Turkey**: Salvini has been vocal about various international issues, including his stance on Turkey's political actions and its relationship with the European Union.
- **Women's Rights in Turkey**: Turkey has faced criticism for its stance on women's rights, including its withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention, which aims to protect women from violence.

However, without a specific context or event that directly links Salvini, Turkey, and women, the claim remains vague. There is no widely known or documented incident that directly ties these three elements together in a significant way.

West Africa consists of multiple countries, each with its own policies regarding healthcare and retirement benefits. While Senegal may have a specific program through IPRES (Institution de Prévoyance Retraite du Sénégal) that provides medical care to retirees, it is unlikely that no other country in the region offers any form of medical care to retirees. For instance, countries like Ghana and Nigeria have various social security and healthcare schemes that may include provisions for retirees.

Given the complexity and variability of social security systems across West Africa, the claim that Senegal is the ""only"" country providing medical care to retirees is likely an overstatement.

This involves looking at infection rates, trends, and other relevant data.

1. **Infection Rates**: If Liguria has significantly higher or lower infection rates compared to the national average, this would support the claim.
2. **Trends**: If the trend in Liguria (e.g., increasing or decreasing cases) is different from the national trend, this would also support the claim.
3. **Other Relevant Data**: Hospitalization rates, death rates, and other metrics could also be considered.

Without specific data, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date data showing a significant discrepancy between Liguria and the rest of Italy, we can evaluate the claim accordingly.

1. **Vocational Education System in Ceará**: Ceará has a network of full-time vocational high schools that aim to integrate academic education with technical and professional training.

2. **Internship Programs**: These schools often include internship programs as part of their curriculum to provide practical experience to students. However, the availability and nature of these internships can vary.

3. **Government Involvement**: The government of Ceará does support vocational education and may facilitate internships, but it is important to verify if this support extends to all students and if all internships are paid.

4. **Sources and Evidence**: To accurately assess the claim, we would need specific information from official sources such as the Ceará State Department of Education or other authoritative bodies overseeing vocational education in the region.

Given the complexity and variability in educational programs, it is unlikely that every single student from all full-time vocational high schools in Ceará is guaranteed a paid internship by the government. There may be programs and initiatives in place, but they might not cover every student universally.

1. **Historical Context**: The PMDB was a significant political party in Brazil and held considerable influence in the Brazilian Congress. During the impeachment process of President Dilma Rousseff, the PMDB played a crucial role.

2. **Actions of PMDB Leaders**: Michel Temer, who was the Vice President under Rousseff and a member of the PMDB, became a central figure in the impeachment process. After Rousseff's impeachment, Temer assumed the presidency. Other PMDB leaders, such as Eduardo Cunha, who was the Speaker of the House of Representatives, were also actively involved in the impeachment proceedings.

3. **Parliamentary Group**: The PMDB's parliamentary group in both the House of Representatives and the Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of Rousseff's impeachment. Their support was pivotal in the success of the impeachment vote.

Given this context, the claim that the PMDB, its leaders, and its parliamentary group ""have never acted as an active force in this (impeachment) process"" is not accurate.

1. The percentage of television appearances by Matteo Salvini in May.
2. The percentage of television appearances by President Conte in May.
3. Whether Salvini's appearances were almost double those of Conte.

Without specific data on the television appearances of both Matteo Salvini and President Conte for the month of May, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on reliable data sources, we can analyze the plausibility.

Given that Matteo Salvini has been a prominent political figure in Italy, especially around the time of the European Parliament elections in May 2019, it is plausible that he had a significant media presence. However, without concrete numbers, we cannot confirm the exact ratio of appearances.

This type of claim is often derived from surveys or studies, and the interpretation of the data can vary based on how the questions were phrased and the sample population.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there is a reputable source or study that supports this statistic. Reliable sources include academic research, government reports, or surveys conducted by reputable organizations.

2. **Context and Interpretation**: Understand the context in which the question was asked. Sometimes, survey questions can be leading or ambiguous, which can affect the responses. Additionally, the interpretation of the results can be subjective.

3. **Reputation of the Source**: Evaluate the credibility of the source. If the source is known for rigorous methodology and unbiased reporting, the claim is more likely to be accurate.

The claim states that in 2017, the percentage of convicted individuals surpassed that of those prosecuted for the first time in history.

1. **Logical Consistency**: By definition, the percentage of convicted individuals cannot surpass the percentage of those prosecuted because convictions are a subset of prosecutions. Every convicted individual must have been prosecuted first. Therefore, the percentage of convicted individuals can never exceed the percentage of those prosecuted.

2. **Statistical Feasibility**: Historically, the number of prosecutions is always equal to or greater than the number of convictions. This is because not all prosecutions result in convictions; some may result in acquittals, dismissals, or other outcomes.

Given these points, the claim is logically and statistically impossible.

3. **Context**: The context in which the reduction occurred is important. For instance, was there a significant policy change, community intervention, or other factors that contributed to the reduction?

4. **Comparison**: The baseline data (i.e., the number of homicides before the reduction) should be clear to understand the magnitude of the change.

Without specific data and context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a credible source and there is supporting evidence, we might lean towards a positive assessment.

1. **Argentina's FDI in 2012**: According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) World Investment Report, Argentina received approximately $12.5 billion in FDI in 2012.

2. **Comparison with other years in the decade**: 
   - In 2011, Argentina received around $7.2 billion in FDI.
   - In 2010, the FDI was approximately $6.2 billion.
   - In 2009, it was around $4.9 billion.
   - The FDI figures for the earlier part of the decade (2003-2008) were generally lower than in 2012.

3. **Comparison with other countries**: While Argentina's FDI in 2012 was significant for the country, it was not the highest in the region or globally. For instance, Brazil received around $65 billion in FDI in 2012, which was much higher than Argentina's.

Based on this information, the claim that Argentina had the most significant FDI of the entire decade in 2012 is accurate when considering Argentina's own FDI history within that decade.

"« N’oubliez pas qu’en vingt ans, l’espérance de vie en Afrique a augmenté, plus que partout ailleurs dans le monde ».",true,fr,"""Don't forget that in twenty years, life expectancy in Africa has increased more than anywhere else in the world.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""in twenty years, life expectancy in Africa has increased more than anywhere else in the world,"" we need to examine data on life expectancy trends globally over the past two decades.

According to data from sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, life expectancy in Africa has indeed seen significant improvements over the past 20 years. Factors contributing to this increase include better access to healthcare, improvements in disease prevention and treatment (such as HIV/AIDS), and overall economic development.

However, to confirm whether this increase is the highest compared to other regions, we need to compare it with life expectancy increases in other parts of the world. Data indicates that while Africa has made substantial gains, other regions, particularly those starting from a higher baseline, may not have seen as dramatic an increase in absolute terms but have still experienced significant improvements.

Based on available data, it is reasonable to conclude that Africa has seen one of the most substantial increases in life expectancy, but whether it is definitively the highest increase compared to all other regions can be subject to interpretation and specific metrics used.

«Tutti devono sapere: Germania padrona dell’Ue. Aiuti a imprese italiane 25 miliardi. Aiuti a imprese tedesche 550 miliardi»,false,it,"""Everyone must know: Germany is the master of the EU. Aid to Italian businesses: 25 billion. Aid to German businesses: 550 billion.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts: the assertion that ""Germany is the master of the EU"" and the comparison of aid amounts to Italian and German businesses.

1. ""Germany is the master of the EU"":
   - This is a subjective statement and can be interpreted in various ways. Germany is indeed one of the most influential and economically powerful countries in the European Union, but saying it is the ""master"" is an opinion rather than a fact.

2. Aid to Italian businesses: 25 billion vs. Aid to German businesses: 550 billion:
   - During the COVID-19 pandemic, different countries in the EU provided varying levels of financial aid to support their economies. Germany, with its larger economy and greater fiscal capacity, was able to allocate more substantial aid packages compared to Italy.
   - According to various reports, Germany did indeed announce aid packages that could total up to 550 billion euros, while Italy's aid packages were significantly smaller, around 25 billion euros initially, though later packages increased this amount.

Given the subjective nature of the first part of the claim and the factual basis of the second part, the overall claim can be considered a mix of opinion and fact. The aid figures are roughly accurate, but the statement about Germany being the ""master"" of the EU is not a verifiable fact.

“Argentina es el tercer país proveedor mundial de cocaína”,mostly true,es,"""Argentina is the third largest supplier of cocaine in the world.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Argentina is the third largest supplier of cocaine in the world,"" we need to look at the global production and supply of cocaine. The primary producers of cocaine are typically countries in the Andean region of South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. These countries have historically been the largest producers of coca leaves, which are the raw material for cocaine production.

Argentina, on the other hand, is not known for large-scale coca cultivation or cocaine production. Instead, it is more commonly recognized as a transit country where cocaine produced in other countries is trafficked through on its way to other markets.

Given this context, the claim that Argentina is the third largest supplier of cocaine in the world does not align with the established data on cocaine production.

«Un terzo della spesa sanitaria lo paghiamo con l’Irap» (min. 1:42:48),half true,it,'We pay one third of healthcare expenses with the Irap' (min. 1:42:48).,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We pay one third of healthcare expenses with the Irap,"" we need to understand what Irap is and how it relates to healthcare expenses.

Irap (Imposta Regionale sulle Attività Produttive) is an Italian regional tax on productive activities. It is levied on the net value of production generated in each region by businesses and professionals. The revenue from Irap is used to fund various regional services, including healthcare.

However, saying that ""we pay one third of healthcare expenses with the Irap"" implies a specific proportion of healthcare funding comes from this tax. To verify this, we would need to look at the actual budget allocations and financial reports from Italian regional governments to see if one third of healthcare expenses are indeed covered by Irap revenues.

Without specific data to confirm this exact proportion, it is difficult to assert the claim as entirely true. However, it is known that Irap does contribute significantly to healthcare funding in Italy.

Given the information available, the claim seems to be an overgeneralization without precise data to back it up.

1. **Source Verification**: The claim is attributed to Minister Mansour Sy. It is important to verify if he indeed made this statement and in what context.
2. **Data Verification**: We need to check the employment statistics for Senegal between 2012 and 2015 from reliable sources such as government reports, international labor organizations, or economic studies.

Without access to specific data sources or the ability to verify the statement directly, we can only make an educated guess based on the information provided.

"«In Italia un GIOVANE su cinque fra i 15 e i 24 anni non ha un lavoro né studia, e il 15% di chi ha fra 25 e 39 anni ha un ""lavoro atipico"" a rischio precarietà»",mostly true,it,"'In Italy, one in five YOUNG people between the ages of 15 and 24 neither has a job nor studies, and 15% of those between 25 and 39 have an ""atypical job"" at risk of precariousness.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the statistics provided about young people in Italy. The claim states two main points:

1. One in five young people between the ages of 15 and 24 neither has a job nor studies.
2. 15% of those between 25 and 39 have an ""atypical job"" at risk of precariousness.

Let's break down the information:

1. **One in five young people between the ages of 15 and 24 neither has a job nor studies:**
   - This statistic refers to the NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) rate. According to Eurostat and other reliable sources, Italy has one of the highest NEET rates in Europe. As of recent data, the NEET rate for the 15-24 age group in Italy is indeed around 20%, which aligns with the ""one in five"" claim.

2. **15% of those between 25 and 39 have an ""atypical job"" at risk of precariousness:**
   - ""Atypical jobs"" generally refer to temporary, part-time, or otherwise non-standard forms of employment. Data from sources like ISTAT (Italian National Institute of Statistics) and Eurostat indicate that a significant portion of the workforce in this age group is engaged in such forms of employment. While the exact percentage can vary, 15% is a reasonable estimate based on available data.

Given that both parts of the claim are supported by data from reliable sources, the claim appears to be accurate.

“Desde 2007 no se crea empleo privado en la Argentina”,false,es,"""Since 2007, no private employment has been created in Argentina.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Since 2007, no private employment has been created in Argentina,"" we need to examine the available data on private sector employment in Argentina from 2007 to the present.

1. **Historical Context**: Argentina has experienced various economic challenges, including periods of recession, inflation, and political instability, which can impact employment trends.

2. **Employment Data**: According to data from Argentina's Ministry of Labor and other economic reports, there have been fluctuations in private sector employment over the years. While there have been periods of stagnation or decline, there have also been periods of growth in private sector jobs.

3. **Economic Reports**: Various economic reports and analyses indicate that while the growth in private sector employment has been inconsistent, it is not accurate to say that no private employment has been created at all since 2007. There have been years where private sector employment has increased, even if modestly.

Given this information, the claim that ""no private employment has been created in Argentina since 2007"" is an exaggeration and does not accurately reflect the nuanced reality of Argentina's employment trends.

Now we have hired a few hundred.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. The number of assets managed by the Minister of the Interior.
2. The staffing levels of the agency for confiscated mafia assets.
3. The value of the portfolio of seizures and confiscations.
4. Recent hiring efforts to increase the number of staff.

1. **Number of Assets Managed**: The claim states that about 15,000 assets are managed. According to various reports and official statements, the number of assets confiscated from the mafia in Italy is indeed in the range of thousands, often cited around 15,000.

2. **Staffing Levels**: The claim mentions that the agency had fewer than 100 people. Historical data and reports indicate that the agency for confiscated mafia assets has been criticized for being understaffed, with numbers often cited around or below 100.

3. **Value of the Portfolio**: The claim states that the portfolio is worth billions of euros. This is consistent with reports that the value of confiscated mafia assets in Italy is indeed in the billions of euros.

4. **Recent Hiring Efforts**: The claim mentions that a few hundred people have been hired recently. There have been efforts to increase staffing levels in the agency to better manage the large portfolio of assets, and reports indicate that there have been significant hiring initiatives.

Given the alignment of these points with available data and reports, the claim appears to be accurate.

“La Argentina tiene una carga tributaria récord en Latinoamérica”,true,es,"""Argentina has a record tax burden in Latin America.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Argentina has a record tax burden in Latin America,"" we need to examine the available data on tax burdens across Latin American countries.

1. **Definition of Tax Burden**: Tax burden typically refers to the ratio of tax revenue to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), indicating the proportion of a country's economic output that is collected in taxes.

2. **Comparative Data**: According to data from organizations such as the OECD, World Bank, and regional economic reports, Argentina has consistently been reported to have one of the highest tax burdens in Latin America. For instance, the OECD's ""Revenue Statistics in Latin America and the Caribbean"" often shows Argentina at the top or near the top in terms of tax-to-GDP ratio.

3. **Recent Figures**: As of the latest available data, Argentina's tax burden is indeed among the highest in the region, often exceeding 30% of GDP. This is significantly higher than the regional average, which tends to be around 20-25%.

4. **Contextual Factors**: Argentina's high tax burden is influenced by various factors, including extensive social programs, subsidies, and a complex tax system that includes multiple layers of taxation.

Given this information, the claim that ""Argentina has a record tax burden in Latin America"" is supported by comparative data and consistent reporting from credible sources.

Le gisement de gaz découvert au large de Saint-Louis constituent la 5e réserve mondiale.,false,fr,The gas deposit discovered off the coast of Saint-Louis constitutes the 5th largest reserve in the world.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The gas deposit discovered off the coast of Saint-Louis constitutes the 5th largest reserve in the world,"" we need to verify the size and ranking of the gas deposit in question.

1. **Location and Discovery**: The gas deposit off the coast of Saint-Louis is likely referring to the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) gas field, which is located offshore between Senegal and Mauritania.

2. **Size of the Reserve**: The GTA gas field is estimated to contain around 15 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas.

3. **Global Ranking**: The largest natural gas reserves in the world are significantly larger than 15 tcf. For example, the South Pars/North Dome field (shared between Iran and Qatar) contains around 1,200 tcf, and other major fields like those in Russia, Turkmenistan, and the United States also have reserves much larger than 15 tcf.

Given this information, the claim that the gas deposit off the coast of Saint-Louis is the 5th largest in the world is not accurate. The GTA gas field, while significant, does not rank among the top five largest gas reserves globally.

Salvini e il boom del '93,false,it,Salvini and the boom of '93.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Salvini and the boom of '93,"" we need to consider the historical context and the individuals involved.

Matteo Salvini is an Italian politician who is currently the leader of the League (Lega) party. He was born in 1973, which means he was only 20 years old in 1993. Salvini's significant political career began much later, with him becoming a prominent figure in Italian politics in the 2010s.

The ""boom of '93"" could refer to various events, but it is not commonly associated with Salvini. In 1993, Italy was experiencing significant political upheaval due to the Tangentopoli (Bribesville) scandal, which led to the collapse of many traditional political parties. However, Salvini was not a key player in these events.

Given this context, the claim ""Salvini and the boom of '93"" does not align with historical facts regarding Salvini's political career or significant events he was involved in during that time.

Salvini sbaglia: sul 730 precompilato facciamo già “come il Belgio”,true,it,"Salvini is wrong: with the pre-filled 730 form, we already do it ""like Belgium"".","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Salvini is wrong: with the pre-filled 730 form, we already do it 'like Belgium',"" we need to compare the tax filing processes in Italy and Belgium, specifically focusing on the pre-filled tax forms.

1. **Italy's Pre-Filled 730 Form**: 
   - Italy offers a pre-filled 730 form for taxpayers, which includes information already known to the tax authorities, such as income from employment, pensions, and certain deductible expenses. Taxpayers can review, modify if necessary, and submit this form.

2. **Belgium's Pre-Filled Tax Forms**:
   - Belgium also provides pre-filled tax returns. The Belgian tax authorities send out pre-filled forms that include income data and other relevant information. Taxpayers can review, correct, and submit these forms.

**Comparison**:
- Both Italy and Belgium provide pre-filled tax forms to their taxpayers.
- The process in both countries involves the tax authorities pre-filling the forms with known data, which taxpayers can then review and submit.

Given this information, the claim that ""with the pre-filled 730 form, we already do it 'like Belgium'"" is accurate in the context of both countries offering a similar pre-filled tax form service.

Prestiti e pressione fiscale per le imprese: le cose sono peggiorate?,false,it,Loans and tax pressure for businesses: have things gotten worse?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Loans and tax pressure for businesses: have things gotten worse?"", we need to consider several factors, including recent trends in interest rates, lending practices, tax policies, and economic conditions.

1. **Interest Rates and Lending Practices**:
   - If interest rates have increased, borrowing costs for businesses would rise, making loans more expensive.
   - Stricter lending standards could also make it harder for businesses to obtain loans.

2. **Tax Policies**:
   - Changes in tax laws, such as increased corporate tax rates or reduced deductions, could increase the tax burden on businesses.
   - Conversely, tax cuts or incentives could reduce the tax pressure.

3. **Economic Conditions**:
   - Economic downturns or recessions can exacerbate financial pressures on businesses, including difficulties in securing loans and managing tax obligations.

**Recent Trends**:
- As of the latest data, many central banks have been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which would increase borrowing costs for businesses.
- Some regions have seen changes in tax policies that could either increase or decrease the tax burden on businesses, depending on the specific measures implemented.

Given these considerations, the claim that ""Loans and tax pressure for businesses: have things gotten worse?"" can be evaluated as follows:

- **Interest Rates**: Generally increasing, leading to higher loan costs.
- **Tax Policies**: Vary by region, but there have been instances of increased tax burdens in some areas.

**Conclusion**:
The claim is nuanced and depends on specific regional and temporal contexts. However, considering the general trend of rising interest rates and some instances of increased tax burdens, the claim leans towards being accurate.

1. **Matteo Salvini's Statement**: Salvini claims that the PD voted in favor of insects for food use.
2. **Verification**: Check the voting records and official positions of both PD and Forza Italia on this issue.

If the PD did not vote in favor of insects for food use, but Forza Italia did, then Salvini's statement would be incorrect.

Based on the information provided:

- If the PD did not vote in favor of insects for food use, but Forza Italia did, then Salvini's statement is incorrect.

1. **Official Crime Statistics**: The Italian Ministry of the Interior and other official crime reporting agencies would provide the most accurate data on crime rates, including the nationality of offenders.

2. **Context and Interpretation**: It's important to consider the context in which the data is presented. For example, the percentage of rapes committed by foreigners might be influenced by various factors such as the total number of foreigners in Italy, reporting practices, and socio-economic conditions.

Electronic voting systems can offer benefits such as speed and convenience, and they can be designed to provide a high level of security and accuracy. However, the simplicity and certainty of these systems can vary significantly based on their design, implementation, and the context in which they are used.

1. **Simplicity**: While electronic voting systems can simplify the voting process for users, the underlying technology and infrastructure can be quite complex. Ensuring the system is user-friendly while maintaining robust security measures is a challenging task.

2. **Certainty and Guarantees**: Electronic voting systems can provide a high degree of accuracy and security, but they are not infallible. Issues such as software bugs, hardware malfunctions, cyber-attacks, and human error can impact their reliability. Additionally, the transparency and verifiability of electronic voting systems are crucial for public trust, and these aspects can vary.

"Rom, Sinti e Camminanti: almeno 8 mila a Roma",true,it,"Roma, Sinti, and Camminanti: at least 8 thousand in Rome.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Roma, Sinti, and Camminanti: at least 8 thousand in Rome,"" we need to consider available data and reports on the population of these groups in Rome.

1. **Roma and Sinti Population Estimates**: Various reports and studies have estimated the population of Roma and Sinti in Italy and specifically in Rome. According to a 2017 report by the Associazione 21 Luglio, an organization that focuses on the rights of Roma and Sinti communities, there were approximately 6,000 Roma living in formal and informal settlements in Rome. This figure does not necessarily include all Roma, Sinti, and Camminanti individuals, as some may live in regular housing and not be counted in these estimates.

2. **Camminanti Population**: The Camminanti are a smaller, less well-documented group compared to the Roma and Sinti. There is limited specific data on their population in Rome, but they are generally considered to be a minority within the broader context of itinerant communities.

3. **Total Population Consideration**: Combining the estimates for Roma and Sinti with the potential number of Camminanti, it is plausible that the total number could reach or exceed 8,000, especially considering those not living in settlements and thus not included in some counts.

Given the available data, the claim that there are ""at least 8 thousand"" Roma, Sinti, and Camminanti in Rome is supported by estimates but may slightly overstate the certainty of the exact number.

"« Seulement 7% des communes au Sénégal, disposent d’un plan d’urbanisme »",true,fr,"""Only 7% of municipalities in Senegal have an urban planning scheme.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Only 7% of municipalities in Senegal have an urban planning scheme,"" we need to verify the most recent and reliable data available on urban planning in Senegal.

1. **Research and Data Verification**: 
   - According to various reports and studies on urban planning in Senegal, it is noted that urban planning is a significant challenge in the country. Many municipalities lack comprehensive urban planning schemes.
   - The World Bank and other international organizations have highlighted the need for improved urban planning in Senegal, indicating that a small percentage of municipalities have formal urban planning schemes.

2. **Official Sources**:
   - If we refer to official sources such as government reports or publications from urban planning authorities in Senegal, they often provide statistics on the number of municipalities with approved urban planning schemes.

3. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - The claim suggests a very low percentage (7%), which aligns with the general understanding that urban planning is underdeveloped in many parts of Senegal.

Given the information available and the context provided by various reports, the claim appears to be accurate.

"“Argentina era el tercer exportador mundial de carne, hoy somos el 14°”",true,es,"""Argentina was the third largest meat exporter in the world, today we are the 14th.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Argentina was the third largest meat exporter in the world, today we are the 14th,"" we need to verify historical and current data on Argentina's meat export rankings.

1. **Historical Context**: Argentina has historically been one of the top meat exporters globally. In the early to mid-20th century, Argentina was indeed among the top meat exporters, often ranking within the top three.

2. **Current Data**: According to recent data from sources like the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Argentina's ranking in meat exports has fluctuated. As of the latest available data, Argentina is typically ranked within the top 10 meat exporters, but not as low as 14th.

Given this information, the claim that Argentina was the third largest meat exporter historically is accurate. However, the assertion that it is currently the 14th largest is not supported by the most recent data, which places Argentina higher in the rankings.

"Il governo ha deciso di ammazzare le imprese. Con dl crescita chi ristruttura un appartamento paga metà importo, l'altro 50 per cento l'impresa se lo ritrova come ""bonus fiscale"" spalmato in 5 anni. Anziché spremere le imprese come limoni lo Stato abbassi le tasse!.",half true,it,"The government has decided to kill businesses. With the growth decree, those who renovate an apartment pay half the amount, while the other 50 percent is given to the business as a ""tax bonus"" spread over 5 years. Instead of squeezing businesses like lemons, the State should lower taxes!","To evaluate the claim, let's break down the key points:

1. **Government's Decision to Kill Businesses**: This is a subjective statement and an opinion rather than a factual claim. It reflects the speaker's perspective on the impact of the policy.

2. **Growth Decree and Renovation Payments**: The claim states that those who renovate an apartment pay half the amount, while the other 50 percent is given to the business as a ""tax bonus"" spread over 5 years. This seems to refer to a policy where the government provides incentives for renovations, possibly through tax credits or deductions.

3. **Impact on Businesses**: The claim suggests that instead of providing these incentives, the government should lower taxes directly. This is again an opinion on what the government policy should be.

To determine the factual accuracy:

- **Renovation Incentives**: Many governments do offer tax incentives for renovations to stimulate the economy and improve housing. These incentives can take the form of tax credits or deductions spread over several years.

- **Tax Bonus**: If the policy indeed provides a tax bonus or credit to businesses, this would be a factual statement. However, the exact mechanism (whether it's 50% and spread over 5 years) would need to be verified with the specific details of the growth decree.

Given that the claim mixes factual elements (about the policy) with subjective opinions (about the impact on businesses and what the government should do), it is not entirely factual nor entirely false.

« L'Éthiopie est l'économie à la croissance la plus rapide au monde »,mostly true,fr,'Ethiopia is the fastest growing economy in the world'.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Ethiopia is the fastest growing economy in the world,"" we need to look at recent economic data and growth rates from reliable sources such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.

Ethiopia has indeed experienced significant economic growth over the past decade, often cited as one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa and the world. However, whether it is the fastest-growing economy in the world at any given moment can vary year by year and depends on the specific metrics and timeframes used.

For instance, in some years, Ethiopia has been among the top countries in terms of GDP growth rate, but it is not consistently the fastest-growing economy every year. Other countries, particularly those with smaller economies or those recovering from economic downturns, can sometimes post higher growth rates.

Given this context, the claim that ""Ethiopia is the fastest growing economy in the world"" is an overstatement and not consistently accurate.

Uma lata de cerveja tem menos calorias do que uma dose de caipirinha,true,pt,A can of beer has fewer calories than a serving of caipirinha.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A can of beer has fewer calories than a serving of caipirinha,"" we need to compare the typical calorie content of both beverages.

1. **Calories in a Can of Beer:**
   - A standard 12-ounce (355 ml) can of beer typically contains around 150 calories. However, this can vary depending on the type of beer (light beer, regular beer, craft beer, etc.).

2. **Calories in a Serving of Caipirinha:**
   - A caipirinha is a cocktail made with cachaça, sugar, and lime. A standard serving (about 6 ounces or 180 ml) can contain approximately 200-250 calories. The calorie content can vary based on the amount of sugar and cachaça used.

Given these typical values, a can of beer generally has fewer calories than a serving of caipirinha.

"«La crescita è passata dal -2 al +1: nessun Paese, nello stesso periodo ha fatto un balzo così grande»",false,it,"""Growth has gone from -2 to +1: no country has made such a big leap in the same period.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and the data provided. The claim states that growth has gone from -2 to +1, and no country has made such a big leap in the same period. 

1. **Growth Change**: The change from -2 to +1 represents a 3 percentage point increase in growth.
2. **Comparative Analysis**: The claim asserts that no other country has made a similar leap in the same period. 

Without specific data or a defined time period, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of this statement. However, economic growth rates can vary significantly across countries and time periods, and it is plausible that other countries could have experienced similar or even larger changes in growth rates.

Given the lack of specific data and context, the claim cannot be definitively verified or refuted. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

“La compañía que últimamente ha aumentado más los precios es YPF”,mostly true,es,"""The company that has recently increased prices the most is YPF.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The company that has recently increased prices the most is YPF,"" we would need specific and up-to-date information on price changes by YPF and other companies in the same timeframe. This would involve comparing the percentage or absolute price increases across various companies.

Without access to this specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to approach this:

1. **Identify the timeframe**: Determine what ""recently"" means in this context (e.g., last month, last quarter).
2. **Gather data**: Look at price changes from YPF and compare them to other companies in the same industry or market.
3. **Analyze the data**: Compare the magnitude of the price increases.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot make a definitive judgment. Therefore, based on the information provided:

1. **Regulatory Standards**: Train safety standards are typically regulated by national and international bodies. For example, in the United States, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) sets safety standards, while in Europe, the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) does so. These standards are generally stringent and aim to ensure high levels of safety.

2. **Technological Advancements**: Modern trains, including both high-speed and conventional trains, often incorporate advanced safety technologies such as Positive Train Control (PTC), Automatic Train Protection (ATP), and other signaling systems designed to prevent accidents.

3. **Safety Records**: Historical safety records and incident reports can provide insight into the effectiveness of these safety systems. Generally, rail travel is considered one of the safest modes of transportation, with relatively low accident rates compared to road travel.

4. **Independent Assessments**: Independent reviews and audits by safety organizations or watchdog groups can offer an unbiased perspective on the safety standards of train systems.

Given that regulatory bodies enforce high safety standards, and modern trains are equipped with advanced safety technologies, the claim that the safety standards are ""top-notch"" is generally supported. However, the term ""top-notch"" is somewhat subjective and can vary based on specific contexts and comparisons.

1. **Conicet (Argentina)**: As of recent data, Conicet (National Scientific and Technical Research Council) has around 14,000 researchers.

2. **France**: The main research organization in France is CNRS (National Centre for Scientific Research). CNRS employs over 30,000 researchers, which is significantly higher than 14,000.

3. **Spain**: The main research organization in Spain is CSIC (Spanish National Research Council). CSIC has around 11,000 researchers, which is slightly lower than 14,000.

Given this information:
- The claim that Conicet has set a cap of 14,000 researchers is accurate.
- The comparison with France is incorrect because CNRS has more researchers.
- The comparison with Spain is accurate because CSIC has fewer researchers.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but not entirely correct.

1. **Source of the Claim**: Is the claim coming from a reliable and unbiased source? If the source has a history of accuracy and reliability, the claim might be more credible.

2. **Details of the Project**: What exactly is the opposition's project? Does it involve large-scale infrastructure, social programs, or other initiatives that could reasonably cost over $100 billion annually?

3. **Budget Analysis**: Have there been any independent analyses or reports that estimate the fiscal cost of the project? If so, do these reports support or contradict the $100 billion figure?

4. **Context**: Is the $100 billion figure being used in a specific context, such as over a multi-year period, or is it an annual cost? Misinterpretation of the context can lead to incorrect conclusions.

Without specific details about the project and independent verification, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some form of analysis or report, we might lean towards a middle-ground assessment.

Le kilogramme de zircon ne coûte qu'un dollar sur le marché international.,mostly true,fr,A kilogram of zircon costs only one dollar on the international market.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""A kilogram of zircon costs only one dollar on the international market,"" we need to consider the current market prices for zircon. Zircon is a mineral used in various industrial applications, including ceramics, refractories, and foundry casting. The price of zircon can vary based on factors such as quality, purity, and market demand.

As of the most recent data, the price of zircon typically ranges from several hundred to over a thousand dollars per metric ton, which translates to several dollars per kilogram. Therefore, the claim that a kilogram of zircon costs only one dollar is significantly lower than the actual market price.

It surpasses all the universities in the Maghreb.,"To evaluate the claim that ""Cheikh Anta Diop University (UCAD) in Dakar is the leading French-speaking university in Africa and surpasses all the universities in the Maghreb,"" we need to consider several factors, including academic reputation, research output, faculty qualifications, and international rankings.

1. **Academic Reputation and Research Output**: UCAD is indeed one of the most prestigious universities in French-speaking Africa, known for its strong academic programs and research contributions. It has a significant reputation in various fields, particularly in the humanities and social sciences.

2. **Comparative Analysis with Maghreb Universities**: The Maghreb region includes countries like Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, which also have reputable French-speaking universities such as the University of Algiers, University of Tunis, and Mohammed V University in Rabat. These institutions also have strong academic programs and research outputs.

3. **International Rankings**: According to various international university rankings (such as QS World University Rankings and Times Higher Education), UCAD is often listed among the top universities in Africa. However, universities in the Maghreb also feature prominently in these rankings, sometimes even surpassing UCAD in specific metrics.

Given this information, while UCAD is undoubtedly a leading French-speaking university in Africa, the claim that it ""surpasses all the universities in the Maghreb"" is more contentious and not universally supported by all metrics.

80 %¨des Nigerians n'ont pas accès à l'eau potable.,half true,fr,80% of Nigerians do not have access to drinking water.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""80% of Nigerians do not have access to drinking water,"" we need to look at reliable sources and data on water access in Nigeria.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), as of recent reports, around 70 million Nigerians lack access to basic drinking water services. Given Nigeria's population of approximately 200 million, this translates to about 35% of the population lacking access to basic drinking water services.

Therefore, the claim that 80% of Nigerians do not have access to drinking water is significantly higher than the data suggests.

Le Sénégal est le 8e pays africain en matière de taux d'accès à l'électricité.,false,fr,Senegal is the 8th African country in terms of electricity access rate.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Senegal is the 8th African country in terms of electricity access rate,"" we need to refer to the most recent and reliable data on electricity access rates in African countries. This information is typically provided by organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the World Bank, or other reputable sources that track energy access statistics.

As of the latest available data, Senegal has made significant progress in increasing its electricity access rate, but it is important to verify its exact ranking among African countries. According to the World Bank's data on electricity access, several African countries have higher access rates, including countries like Egypt, South Africa, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and others.

Given the need for precise and up-to-date information to confirm the exact ranking, and based on the general knowledge that several African countries have higher electricity access rates than Senegal, it is unlikely that Senegal is the 8th in terms of electricity access rate.

"No, il Parlamento Ue non ha detto sì all’«invasione» di migranti",false,it,"No, the EU Parliament has not said yes to the ""invasion"" of migrants.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""No, the EU Parliament has not said yes to the 'invasion' of migrants,"" we need to consider the context and the language used.

1. **EU Parliament's Stance on Migration**: The European Parliament has policies and resolutions regarding migration, but it does not frame its decisions in terms of approving an ""invasion."" The term ""invasion"" is highly charged and implies a hostile or aggressive action, which is not how the EU Parliament discusses or frames its migration policies.

2. **Legislative Actions**: The EU Parliament has passed various measures to manage and regulate migration, including asylum policies, border control, and integration measures. These actions are aimed at managing migration in a controlled and humane manner, not endorsing an ""invasion.""

3. **Terminology**: The use of the word ""invasion"" is misleading and not reflective of the EU Parliament's language or intentions. It is more likely to be used in a sensationalist or politically charged context rather than an accurate description of the EU Parliament's actions.

Given these points, the claim that the EU Parliament has not said yes to the ""invasion"" of migrants is accurate because the EU Parliament does not use such terminology and does not endorse uncontrolled or hostile migration.

The claim is that the labor market has remained stable and that there have not been more layoffs than in 2012 and 2013.

1. **Labor Market Stability**: Stability in the labor market can be measured by various indicators such as unemployment rates, job creation rates, and overall economic conditions. If these indicators have not shown significant fluctuations, the labor market can be considered stable.

2. **Layoffs Comparison**: To verify the claim about layoffs, we need to compare the number of layoffs in the current period with those in 2012 and 2013. If the number of layoffs is similar or lower, the claim holds.

Without specific data from the current period and the years 2012 and 2013, we can only make a general assessment. Assuming the statement is based on accurate data and there have been no significant economic disruptions, the claim could be considered accurate.

Le lavage des mains peut réduire les risque de maladies infectieuses de 59%.,half true,fr,Handwashing can reduce the risk of infectious diseases by 59%.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Handwashing can reduce the risk of infectious diseases by 59%,"" we need to consider the available scientific evidence and studies on the effectiveness of handwashing in preventing infectious diseases.

Handwashing is widely recognized as one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of many types of infections and illnesses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), proper handwashing can significantly reduce the risk of respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases. Various studies have shown that handwashing with soap can reduce the incidence of diarrheal diseases by 30-48% and respiratory infections by 16-21%.

However, the specific figure of 59% reduction in the risk of infectious diseases is not a commonly cited statistic in the literature. The effectiveness of handwashing can vary depending on factors such as the type of infectious disease, the population being studied, and the context in which handwashing is practiced.

Given that the claim is somewhat higher than the commonly cited figures but still within a plausible range, it can be considered somewhat accurate but not entirely precise.

1. **Data Verification**: Check the latest reports from agencies like the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration), UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), or other relevant bodies.
2. **Historical Context**: Compare the current data with historical records to see if the current figures are indeed the highest ever recorded.
3. **Geographical Scope**: Ensure the claim is specific to a particular region or globally, as drug seizure records can vary significantly by location.

Without access to the most recent and specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if recent reports from credible sources indicate that drug seizures have reached unprecedented levels, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. Conversely, if the data shows otherwise, the claim could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Une partie de la presse sénégalaise a assimilé les arriérés de paiement à la dette intérieure.,false,fr,Some of the Senegalese press equated payment arrears with domestic debt.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Some of the Senegalese press equated payment arrears with domestic debt,"" we need to consider the definitions and context.

1. **Payment Arrears**: These are overdue payments that have not been made by the due date. They can occur in various contexts, such as unpaid bills, salaries, or other financial obligations.

2. **Domestic Debt**: This refers to the total amount of money that a country's government owes to creditors within the country. It includes various forms of borrowing, such as bonds, loans, and other financial instruments.

**Analysis**:
- Payment arrears can be a component of domestic debt if the arrears are obligations of the government to domestic entities.
- However, not all payment arrears are necessarily classified as domestic debt. For example, arrears in salary payments to government employees are a liability but may not be categorized as debt in the same way as bonds or loans.

Given this context, the claim that ""Some of the Senegalese press equated payment arrears with domestic debt"" can be seen as an oversimplification. While there is a relationship between the two, equating them directly is not entirely accurate.

**Conclusion**:
The claim has some basis in reality but lacks nuance and precision. Therefore, it is not entirely true but has elements of truth.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there are credible sources or official reports that confirm the allocation of R$ 20 billion to the Emergency Employment and Income Maintenance Program.
2. **Impact Assessment**: Verify if there are studies, reports, or data that support the claim that 11 million jobs were saved as a result of this program.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:

1. **Funding Confirmation**:
   - Verify if the government or relevant authority indeed allocated R$ 20 billion to the program.
   - Look for official budget reports, government announcements, or credible news sources.

2. **Job Impact Verification**:
   - Check for data or reports from labor departments, economic studies, or credible institutions that analyze the impact of the program.
   - Look for statements or reports from economists or labor experts that confirm the number of jobs saved.

### Hypothetical Findings:

- **Funding**: Suppose official government reports confirm that R$ 20 billion was allocated to the Emergency Employment and Income Maintenance Program.
- **Job Impact**: Suppose credible sources, such as labor department reports or economic studies, indicate that the program had a significant impact, saving approximately 11 million jobs.

### Conclusion:

If both the funding and the job impact are verified by credible sources, the claim would be considered accurate. If there are minor discrepancies or if the number of jobs saved is slightly different but still substantial, the claim might be rated as ""Mostly True.""

**Example Verification**:
- **Funding**: Confirmed by government budget reports.

“[El Gobierno] le subió las retenciones al campo a niveles que había antes”,half true,es,"""[The Government] raised the agricultural export taxes to the levels they were at before.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""[The Government] raised the agricultural export taxes to the levels they were at before,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Historical Context**: What were the previous levels of agricultural export taxes?
2. **Current Changes**: What are the new levels of agricultural export taxes after the recent changes?
3. **Comparison**: Are the new levels identical to the previous levels?

If the new levels of agricultural export taxes match exactly with the previous levels, the claim would be 'True'. If they are close but not identical, it might be 'Mostly True'. If there are significant differences, it could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Without specific data on the previous and current levels of agricultural export taxes, it is challenging to make a precise determination. However, assuming the claim is based on accurate information and the levels were indeed restored to their previous state:

"JK, em 3,5 anos, ergueu Brasília",mostly true,pt,"JK, in 3.5 years, built Brasília.","Juscelino Kubitschek, often referred to as JK, was the President of Brazil from 1956 to 1961. One of his most notable achievements was the construction of Brasília, the new capital city of Brazil. The construction of Brasília began in 1956 and the city was officially inaugurated on April 21, 1960. This timeline indicates that the main construction phase took approximately 3.5 years.

However, while the core infrastructure and key buildings were completed within this period, the city continued to develop and expand beyond the initial 3.5 years. Therefore, the claim that ""JK, in 3.5 years, built Brasília"" is accurate in the sense that the primary construction and inauguration occurred within that timeframe, but it does not account for the ongoing development that followed.

“Aumenta sistemáticamente la matrícula de la escuela pública de la Ciudad”,mostly true,es,"""The enrollment in public schools in the City is systematically increasing.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The enrollment in public schools in the City is systematically increasing,"" we would need to examine reliable data sources such as enrollment statistics from the city's Department of Education or other authoritative educational bodies over a period of time. 

If the data shows a consistent upward trend in enrollment numbers over several years, the claim would be 'True'. If the trend is generally upward but with some fluctuations, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the data shows mixed results with no clear trend, it could be 'Half True'. If the trend is generally downward with occasional increases, it might be 'Mostly False'. If the data shows a consistent decline, the claim would be 'False'.

Without specific data to reference, we cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the question and the need for a final answer, we can make an educated guess.

“Los resultados de estos 4 años no fueron buenos,false,es,"""The results of these 4 years were not good.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The results of these 4 years were not good,"" we need to consider the context and the specific results being referred to. Without additional information about what ""results"" are being discussed (e.g., economic performance, political achievements, social progress, etc.), it is challenging to make a definitive judgment.

Given the lack of context and specific metrics to evaluate, the claim is subjective and open to interpretation. Different people might have different opinions on whether the results were good or not based on their perspectives and criteria.

"Plus de 6.500 migrants sont morts dans la Méditerranée entre 2015 et 2016, a dit le président du Niger Mahamadou Issoufou.",mostly true,fr,"More than 6,500 migrants died in the Mediterranean between 2015 and 2016, said Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou.","To determine the accuracy of the claim made by Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou, we need to look at the available data on migrant deaths in the Mediterranean during the specified period (2015-2016).

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other reputable sources, the number of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean in 2015 was approximately 3,771. In 2016, the number was around 5,096. Adding these figures together gives a total of approximately 8,867 deaths over the two years.

Given that the claim states ""more than 6,500 migrants died,"" and the actual number is significantly higher than 6,500, the claim is accurate.

“La Ciudad genera casi el 25% de los recursos coparticipables y se lleva poco más del 1% de coparticipación”,mostly true,es,"""The City generates almost 25% of the shared resources and receives just over 1% of the revenue sharing.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The City generates almost 25% of the shared resources.
2. The City receives just over 1% of the revenue sharing.

Without specific data or context to verify these points, we can only assess the claim based on the information provided. If both points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If one point is accurate and the other is not, it would be 'Half True'. If both points are inaccurate, it would be 'False'. If the points are somewhat accurate but not entirely, it would be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the degree of accuracy.

Given the lack of specific data to verify these points, we cannot definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the information provided is accurate, the claim would be 'True'.

“Nunca antes se gastó menos plata en pauta publicitaria que en este gobierno”,false,es,"""Never before has less money been spent on advertising than in this government.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Never before has less money been spent on advertising than in this government,"" we need to consider historical data on government advertising expenditures. This involves comparing the current government's spending on advertising with that of previous governments.

1. **Historical Context**: We need to look at the advertising budgets of previous administrations to see if there has indeed been a significant reduction in spending.
2. **Current Data**: We need to verify the current government's advertising expenditure.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the current spending with historical spending to see if it is indeed the lowest.

Without specific data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable data and there has been a significant reduction in advertising spending compared to previous governments, the claim could be considered accurate.

I numeri di Salvini: l’economia britannica dopo la Brexit,mostly true,it,Salvini's numbers: the British economy after Brexit.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Salvini's numbers: the British economy after Brexit,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of the Numbers**: Matteo Salvini is an Italian politician, and his statements about the British economy would need to be verified against reliable economic data sources such as the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS), the Bank of England, or reputable economic research institutions.

2. **Economic Indicators**: The British economy post-Brexit can be evaluated using various indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, trade balances, inflation, and foreign investment. These indicators would need to be compared to Salvini's claims.

3. **Context and Interpretation**: The interpretation of economic data can vary. For example, a decline in GDP growth might be seen as negative, but if it is accompanied by a decrease in unemployment, the overall economic picture might be more nuanced.

Without specific details on what ""Salvini's numbers"" refer to, it is challenging to make a precise judgment. However, if we assume that Salvini's numbers are a general statement about the British economy post-Brexit, we can look at the general consensus among economists and data available up to 2023.

**General Consensus**:
- The UK economy has faced challenges post-Brexit, including disruptions in trade, changes in labor markets, and adjustments in regulatory frameworks.
- Some sectors have been more affected than others, and there have been both positive and negative impacts.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data to verify Salvini's exact claims, a general statement about the British economy post-Brexit would likely fall somewhere in the middle of the truth spectrum.

"“El Consejo [de la Magistratura] no funciona, está frenado”",mostly true,es,"""The Council [of the Judiciary] is not functioning, it is stalled.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Council [of the Judiciary] is not functioning, it is stalled,"" we need to consider the current status and activities of the Council of the Judiciary. This involves examining whether the Council is actively performing its duties, holding meetings, making decisions, and carrying out its responsibilities.

If the Council is indeed not holding meetings, not making decisions, or otherwise failing to perform its essential functions, the claim would be 'True'. If the Council is experiencing significant delays or interruptions but is still performing some functions, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the Council is largely operational with only minor issues, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific, up-to-date information on the Council's activities, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent and accurate observations, we can make an educated guess.

“El salario docente está $4.000 por debajo de la línea de pobreza para el maestro de grado”,half true,es,"""The teacher's salary is $4,000 below the poverty line for a grade school teacher.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The teacher's salary is $4,000 below the poverty line for a grade school teacher,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Poverty Line Definition**: The poverty line varies depending on the country and the number of people in a household. For example, in the United States, the federal poverty line for a single individual in 2023 is approximately $14,580, and it increases with the number of household members.

2. **Teacher Salaries**: The average salary for a grade school teacher can vary widely depending on the location, level of experience, and specific school district. In the United States, the average salary for a grade school teacher is generally well above the federal poverty line. According to the National Education Association, the average salary for a public school teacher in the U.S. was around $65,000 in 2021-2022.

Given these points, the claim that a teacher's salary is $4,000 below the poverty line seems highly unlikely, especially considering the average salaries reported.

L'Afrique consacre chaque année une enveloppe de 35 milliards de dollars à l'achat de vires.,half true,fr,Africa allocates an annual budget of 35 billion dollars for the purchase of viruses.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Africa allocates an annual budget of 35 billion dollars for the purchase of viruses,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Source Verification**: There is no credible source or evidence to suggest that any country or continent allocates a budget specifically for the purchase of viruses. This claim lacks context and is not supported by any known governmental or organizational budgetary practices.

2. **Purpose and Practicality**: The idea of purchasing viruses is not a standard or recognized practice. Typically, budgets related to viruses would be allocated towards research, prevention, treatment, and public health initiatives, not for the acquisition of viruses themselves.

3. **Logical Consistency**: The claim does not align with logical or practical public health strategies. Governments and health organizations focus on combating viruses, not purchasing them.

Given the lack of evidence, context, and logical consistency, the claim appears to be unfounded and misleading.

Hoje você tem 564 mil mandados de prisão em aberto,mostly true,pt,Today you have 564 thousand open arrest warrants.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Today you have 564 thousand open arrest warrants,"" we need to consider the context and the source of the information. Open arrest warrants can vary significantly by jurisdiction, and the total number can fluctuate over time. Without specific, up-to-date data from a reliable source, it is challenging to verify the exact number of open arrest warrants at any given moment.

Given the lack of specific, verifiable data to confirm or refute the exact number of 564 thousand open arrest warrants, the claim cannot be definitively proven or disproven. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for this claim, considering the uncertainty and potential for variation, would be 'Half True.'

Eu tenho o dobro do índice [de intenção de voto] do [ex] governador [Geraldo] Alckmin na capital,mostly true,pt,I have double the [voting intention] rate of [former] governor [Geraldo] Alckmin in the capital.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I have double the [voting intention] rate of [former] governor [Geraldo] Alckmin in the capital,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The current voting intention rates for both the claimant and Geraldo Alckmin in the capital.
2. The context and timeframe of the polling data being referenced.

If the claimant's voting intention rate is indeed double that of Geraldo Alckmin's in the capital according to recent and reliable polling data, the claim would be 'True'. If the rate is close to double but not exactly, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the rate is somewhat higher but not close to double, it could be 'Half True'. If the rate is only slightly higher or not higher at all, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific polling data to reference, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and recent polling data, we can make an educated guess.

O número de mortes decorrentes de intervenção policial já ultrapassou o de latrocínio (roubo seguido de morte),true,pt,The number of deaths resulting from police intervention has already surpassed that of robbery followed by murder.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The number of deaths resulting from police intervention has already surpassed that of robbery followed by murder,"" we need to compare the statistics of deaths caused by police intervention with those caused by robbery followed by murder.

1. **Deaths from Police Intervention**: This includes fatalities resulting from police shootings, use of force, and other forms of intervention. Data on this can be found from sources like the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and independent databases like The Washington Post's Fatal Force database.

2. **Deaths from Robbery Followed by Murder**: This category includes homicides that occur during the commission of a robbery. Data on this can also be found from the FBI's UCR Program and other crime statistics databases.

To make an accurate assessment, we would need the most recent and comprehensive data from these sources. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2021, the data trends have shown that deaths from police intervention are significant but typically lower than the total number of homicides, including those resulting from robbery followed by murder. However, without the most recent data, it is challenging to make a definitive statement.

Given the complexity and the need for up-to-date statistics, the claim cannot be verified with the information at hand. Therefore, based on the available data up to 2021, the claim seems unlikely but not impossible.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
“Somos el país con menos muertes del mundo”,false,es,"""We are the country with the fewest deaths in the world.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are the country with the fewest deaths in the world,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Specificity**: The claim is very broad and lacks context. It does not specify the type of deaths (e.g., deaths from a specific cause like COVID-19, overall mortality rate, etc.) or the time frame.

2. **Data Availability**: Accurate and up-to-date global mortality data is necessary to verify this claim. This data is typically collected and reported by international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or national statistical agencies.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Even if a country has a low number of deaths, it must be compared to other countries to determine if it indeed has the fewest deaths.

Given the broad and unspecific nature of the claim, and without concrete data to support it, it is highly unlikely that any country can definitively claim to have the fewest deaths in the world across all categories and time frames.

Bankitalia ha 7.000 dipendenti con uno stipendio medio di 85 mila euro all’anno,mostly true,it,"Bankitalia has 7,000 employees with an average salary of 85,000 euros per year.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Bankitalia has 7,000 employees with an average salary of 85,000 euros per year,"" we need to verify the number of employees and the average salary at Bankitalia (Banca d'Italia).

1. **Number of Employees**: According to the latest available data, Banca d'Italia has approximately 7,000 employees. This figure is consistent with various reports and official statements from the institution.

2. **Average Salary**: The average salary of employees at Banca d'Italia is reported to be around 85,000 euros per year. This figure aligns with the compensation data available for employees in similar roles within central banks and financial institutions in Italy.

Given that both the number of employees and the average salary figures are consistent with available data, the claim appears to be accurate.

L'âge médian au Sénégal est de 18 ans,false,fr,The median age in Senegal is 18 years.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The median age in Senegal is 18 years,"" we need to refer to reliable demographic data sources such as the United Nations, World Bank, or CIA World Factbook.

As of the most recent data available (2023), the median age in Senegal is approximately 19 years. This figure can vary slightly depending on the source, but it is generally around 19 years.

Given that the claim states the median age is 18 years, which is very close to the actual figure of 19 years, the claim is not entirely accurate but is very close to the truth.

According to the World Bank and other reputable sources, the rural electrification rate in Senegal has been improving over the years. As of the latest data, the rural electrification rate in Senegal is estimated to be around 40-45%. This aligns closely with the claim made.

Given this information, the claim that ""approximately 42 to 43% of Senegalese households (in rural areas) have access to electricity"" is consistent with the available data.

Les Ivoiriens représentent 10% des migrants qui arrivent en Italie par le mer.,true,fr,Ivorians represent 10% of the migrants who arrive in Italy by sea.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Ivorians represent 10% of the migrants who arrive in Italy by sea,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on migrant arrivals in Italy by sea. This data is typically collected and reported by organizations such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and Italian government agencies.

As of the latest available data, the percentage of Ivorians among the total number of migrants arriving in Italy by sea can vary year by year. For instance, in some years, Ivorians might constitute a significant portion of the migrant population, while in other years, their numbers might be lower.

Without the most recent specific data at hand, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the exact percentage. However, based on historical trends and available reports, Ivorians have been one of the notable groups among migrants arriving in Italy by sea, but their exact percentage can fluctuate.

Given this context, the claim that Ivorians represent 10% of the migrants who arrive in Italy by sea could be considered plausible but not definitively accurate without the latest data.

Mais de 1 milhão de famílias voltaram a cozinhar à lenha,true,pt,More than 1 million families have gone back to cooking with firewood.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""More than 1 million families have gone back to cooking with firewood,"" we would need to verify it against reliable data sources such as government reports, research studies, or credible news articles. 

Without specific data or sources to confirm or refute this claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a recent trend or report, it could be plausible given certain economic or environmental conditions that might force families to revert to more traditional cooking methods.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, the most cautious and balanced approach would be to consider the claim as potentially accurate but not definitively proven.

[En las causas de corrupción] el tiempo promedio de la instrucción es de siete años,true,es,'[In corruption cases] the average time for the investigation is seven years.',"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""[In corruption cases] the average time for the investigation is seven years,"" we need to consider various factors such as the jurisdiction, the complexity of corruption cases, and available data on investigation durations.

1. **Jurisdiction**: The time taken for corruption investigations can vary significantly between different countries and legal systems. Some countries may have more efficient legal processes, while others may face delays due to bureaucratic hurdles, lack of resources, or political interference.

2. **Complexity**: Corruption cases often involve intricate financial transactions, multiple parties, and extensive evidence gathering, which can prolong investigations. High-profile cases or those involving significant sums of money may take longer to resolve.

3. **Data**: Specific data on the average duration of corruption investigations is not universally available. However, anecdotal evidence and reports from various anti-corruption agencies suggest that lengthy investigations are not uncommon.

Given the variability and lack of specific, universally applicable data, the claim that the average time for corruption investigations is seven years may be an overgeneralization. However, it is not entirely implausible, especially in jurisdictions with known inefficiencies.

La procedura di infrazione europea è stata salvata grazie alla nostra fatturazione elettronica.,half true,it,The European infringement procedure was averted thanks to our electronic invoicing.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The European infringement procedure was averted thanks to our electronic invoicing,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of European infringement procedures and the role of electronic invoicing.

1. **European Infringement Procedure**: This is a legal process initiated by the European Commission against a member state that is not complying with EU law. It typically involves issues like non-implementation of directives, incorrect application of EU law, or failure to meet obligations.

2. **Electronic Invoicing**: This refers to the digital exchange of invoice documents between a supplier and a buyer. It can improve efficiency, reduce errors, and ensure compliance with certain regulations.

For the claim to be true, the electronic invoicing system must have directly addressed a specific compliance issue that would have otherwise led to an infringement procedure by the European Commission.

- If the electronic invoicing system was implemented to comply with a specific EU directive or regulation, and this compliance directly prevented an infringement procedure, the claim could be considered true.
- If the electronic invoicing system was one of several measures taken to ensure compliance, the claim might be ""Mostly True"" or ""Half True"" depending on the significance of the invoicing system in averting the procedure.
- If the electronic invoicing system had little to no direct impact on averting an infringement procedure, the claim would be ""Mostly False"" or ""False.""

Without specific details on the infringement procedure and the role of electronic invoicing, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, assuming the electronic invoicing was a significant factor in compliance:

“Buenos Aires es la ciudad más desigual del país”,false,es,"""Buenos Aires is the most unequal city in the country.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Buenos Aires is the most unequal city in the country,"" we need to consider various factors such as income distribution, access to services, and overall living conditions compared to other cities in Argentina.

1. **Income Distribution**: Buenos Aires, being the capital and the largest city, has significant economic disparities. Wealthy neighborhoods like Recoleta and Palermo contrast sharply with poorer areas like Villa Lugano and Villa Riachuelo.

2. **Access to Services**: Buenos Aires has a wide range of services and amenities, but access can be highly unequal. Wealthier areas have better healthcare, education, and infrastructure compared to poorer neighborhoods.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Other cities in Argentina, such as Rosario and Córdoba, also experience inequality, but the scale and visibility of inequality in Buenos Aires are often more pronounced due to its size and economic significance.

4. **Statistical Data**: According to various reports and studies, Buenos Aires often ranks high in terms of inequality metrics within Argentina. However, specific data comparing it directly to all other cities in the country would be necessary for a definitive conclusion.

Given these points, the claim has a strong basis but may not be absolutely definitive without specific comparative data.

“El gasto social en la Nación es más del 75% del presupuesto”,mostly true,es,"""Social spending in the Nation is more than 75% of the budget.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Social spending in the Nation is more than 75% of the budget,"" we need to examine the composition of the national budget and the proportion allocated to social spending.

Social spending typically includes expenditures on programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment benefits, and other welfare programs. The national budget also includes spending on defense, interest on the national debt, infrastructure, education, and other governmental functions.

According to recent data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other reliable sources, social spending constitutes a significant portion of the federal budget, but it does not exceed 75%. For instance, in the U.S. federal budget, social spending programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid account for a substantial portion, but when combined with other mandatory and discretionary spending, they do not surpass 75% of the total budget.

Based on this information, the claim that ""Social spending in the Nation is more than 75% of the budget"" is not accurate.

1. **Government Data**: The City of Buenos Aires has a population of approximately 3 million people. Official statistics from the city's government or national census data would provide insights into the housing situation.

2. **Housing Organizations**: Reports from organizations like the United Nations, local NGOs, or housing advocacy groups can offer detailed analyses of housing conditions and emergencies.

3. **News Reports**: Credible news sources often report on housing crises and can provide context and figures that support or refute the claim.

Given the complexity and variability of housing data, it is essential to cross-reference multiple sources to ensure accuracy. If recent reports or data from these sources indicate that the number of people in a housing emergency in Buenos Aires is indeed around or exceeds 500,000, the claim would be considered accurate. If the number is significantly lower, the claim would be less accurate.

Without specific data at hand, but considering the context and the potential for housing crises in large urban areas, it is plausible that a significant portion of the population could be facing housing challenges. However, to definitively categorize the claim, we would need precise figures.

**Based on the general understanding and the need for precise data:**

“Bajamos un 20% los homicidios en dos años”,true,es,"""We reduced homicides by 20% in two years.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We reduced homicides by 20% in two years,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. **Baseline Data**: The number of homicides at the start of the two-year period.
2. **Current Data**: The number of homicides at the end of the two-year period.
3. **Calculation**: The percentage reduction in homicides over the two-year period.

For example, if the number of homicides was 100 at the start and reduced to 80 at the end of two years, this would indeed represent a 20% reduction.

Without access to the specific data and context, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and the calculation is correct, the claim would be 'True'.

1. **Context and Source**: The claim lacks context. It does not specify what exactly is increasing by 28%—whether it is funding, research output, technological advancements, or something else. Additionally, the source of this information is not provided, which makes it difficult to verify its credibility.

2. **Time Frame**: The claim does not specify a time frame. Is this increase expected over a year, a decade, or some other period?

3. **Geographical Scope**: The claim does not specify whether this increase pertains to a specific country, region, or globally.

4. **Current Trends and Data**: Without current data or trends to compare against, it's challenging to assess the likelihood of a 28% increase in any aspect of Science and Technology.

Nós temos 40% da população carcerária de presos provisórios,true,pt,We have 40% of the prison population as pre-trial detainees.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""We have 40% of the prison population as pre-trial detainees,"" we need to look at reliable data sources on the composition of the prison population.

According to the World Prison Brief, a project by the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research, the percentage of pre-trial detainees (also known as remand prisoners) varies significantly by country. In some countries, the percentage of pre-trial detainees can be quite high, while in others, it is relatively low.

For example, in the United States, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that a significant portion of the jail population consists of pre-trial detainees. As of recent data, approximately 65% of the jail population in the U.S. are pre-trial detainees. However, this figure pertains to jails, not prisons. Prisons typically house individuals who have been convicted and sentenced, whereas jails often hold individuals awaiting trial or sentencing.

Globally, the percentage of pre-trial detainees can vary widely. Some countries may have a pre-trial detainee population close to or exceeding 40%, while others may have much lower percentages.

Given the variability and the context-specific nature of the data, the claim that ""We have 40% of the prison population as pre-trial detainees"" could be accurate in some contexts but not universally applicable.

Les découvertes de gaz au Sénégal placent le Sénégal au 27e rang mondial et au 5e en Afrique en matière de réserves.,half true,fr,The gas discoveries in Senegal place Senegal 27th in the world and 5th in Africa in terms of reserves.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The gas discoveries in Senegal place Senegal 27th in the world and 5th in Africa in terms of reserves,"" we need to verify the latest data on global and African natural gas reserves.

1. **Global Ranking**: According to the most recent data from sources like the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), or other reputable energy databases, we need to check if Senegal is indeed ranked 27th in the world for natural gas reserves.

2. **African Ranking**: Similarly, we need to verify if Senegal is ranked 5th in Africa for natural gas reserves. Major African countries with significant gas reserves typically include Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, and Mozambique, among others.

Without access to the most current and specific data, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, based on historical data and known major gas reserve holders, Senegal is not typically listed among the top 30 countries globally or the top 5 in Africa.

**Research Findings**:
- **Global Context**: Countries like Russia, Iran, Qatar, the United States, and Turkmenistan are known to have the largest natural gas reserves. Senegal has made significant discoveries, but it is unlikely to be ranked 27th globally.
- **African Context**: Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, and Mozambique are known to have the largest gas reserves in Africa. Senegal's recent discoveries are substantial but not enough to place it 5th in Africa.

Given this context, the claim appears to be an overstatement.

La balance commerciale est déficitaire de 2.000 milliards de FCFA avec 3.500 milliards de FCFA d’importations contre 1.500 milliards de FCFA d’exportations,half true,fr,"The trade balance is in deficit by 2,000 billion FCFA with 3,500 billion FCFA in imports against 1,500 billion FCFA in exports.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the trade balance calculation based on the provided figures for imports and exports.

The trade balance is calculated as:
\[ \text{Trade Balance} = \text{Exports} - \text{Imports} \]

Given:
- Imports = 3,500 billion FCFA
- Exports = 1,500 billion FCFA

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Trade Balance} = 1,500 \text{ billion FCFA} - 3,500 \text{ billion FCFA} \]
\[ \text{Trade Balance} = -2,000 \text{ billion FCFA} \]

The trade balance is indeed in deficit by 2,000 billion FCFA, as the imports exceed the exports by this amount.

"“La velocidad promedio de Internet en 2015 era apenas de 4,5 megabits por segundo, hoy la triplicamos”",mostly true,es,"""The average internet speed in 2015 was just 4.5 megabits per second, today we have tripled it.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The average internet speed in 2015.
2. The current average internet speed and whether it has tripled since 2015.

According to Akamai's ""State of the Internet"" report, the global average internet speed in Q1 2015 was approximately 5 Mbps. This is close to the 4.5 Mbps mentioned in the claim, so we can consider this part mostly accurate.

As of recent reports (2023), the global average internet speed has significantly increased. According to Ookla's Speedtest Global Index, the global average download speed for fixed broadband was around 75 Mbps in 2023. This is more than triple the 4.5 Mbps mentioned for 2015.

Given this information, the claim that the average internet speed has tripled since 2015 is accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
“Se fugaron casi un PBI”,false,es,"""They escaped with almost a GDP.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""They escaped with almost a GDP,"" we need to consider the context and the specifics of the statement. GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of the economic output of a country. The statement is quite vague without additional context, such as the amount of money involved and the size of the GDP being referenced.

If the claim is that a group escaped with an amount of money comparable to the GDP of a small country, it could be plausible depending on the figures. For example, the GDP of some small countries or territories can be in the range of a few billion dollars. If the amount stolen was in the billions, the claim could be considered ""Mostly True"" or ""Half True.""

However, without specific details about the amount of money and the GDP in question, it's challenging to verify the claim accurately. Given the lack of context and specifics, the statement is more likely to be an exaggeration.

"“En 2002 hubo leyes que prohibían despidos y eso no trajo más trabajo, destruyó trabajo”",false,es,"""In 2002, there were laws that prohibited layoffs and that did not bring more jobs, it destroyed jobs.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the context and specifics of labor laws in 2002 and their impact on employment.

1. **Existence of Laws Prohibiting Layoffs in 2002**: 
   - In 2002, there were no widespread laws in major economies that outright prohibited layoffs. Labor laws typically regulate the conditions under which layoffs can occur, such as requiring notice periods, severance pay, or just cause for termination, but they do not generally prohibit layoffs entirely.

2. **Impact on Jobs**:
   - The claim suggests that such laws, if they existed, would destroy jobs rather than create them. Economic theory and empirical evidence often show that overly restrictive labor laws can lead to reduced hiring, as employers may be hesitant to take on new employees if they face significant barriers to adjusting their workforce in response to economic conditions. However, the direct causation and extent of job destruction would depend on various factors, including the specific nature of the laws and the economic context.

Given that the premise of the claim (laws prohibiting layoffs) is not accurate for 2002, and the impact on jobs is speculative and context-dependent, the claim is misleading.

This involves checking the source for any statements or reports that mention the figure of 290 million and understanding what this number refers to (e.g., listeners, funding, broadcasts, etc.).

Without access to the specific data or context from Radio Radicale, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a well-documented and publicly available statistic from Radio Radicale, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided.

Given the lack of specific context and verification, the claim cannot be fully validated or refuted. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be to consider the claim as partially verified but not fully substantiated.

L’Italia ha il record europeo del numero di banche?,false,it,Does Italy hold the European record for the number of banks?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that Italy holds the European record for the number of banks, we need to look at the number of banks in Italy compared to other European countries.

Italy has a significant number of banks, many of which are small, local institutions. Historically, Italy has had a fragmented banking system with numerous small banks. However, other countries in Europe, such as Germany, also have a large number of banks, including many regional and cooperative banks.

As of the latest data, Germany typically has more banks than Italy, largely due to its extensive network of cooperative and savings banks. Therefore, while Italy does have a large number of banks, it does not hold the European record.

"Senza la Lombardia, l’Italia è (quasi) come Germania e Danimarca",mostly true,it,"Without Lombardy, Italy is (almost) like Germany and Denmark.","To evaluate the claim ""Without Lombardy, Italy is (almost) like Germany and Denmark,"" we need to consider several factors, including geography, economy, culture, and historical context.

1. **Geography**: Italy, Germany, and Denmark are distinct in their geographical features. Italy is a peninsula with a Mediterranean climate, while Germany is largely landlocked with a temperate climate, and Denmark is a Scandinavian country with a maritime climate. Removing Lombardy, a region in northern Italy, does not change Italy's overall geographical characteristics significantly.

2. **Economy**: Lombardy is one of Italy's most economically significant regions, contributing a substantial portion to the national GDP. Without Lombardy, Italy's economic profile would be different, but it would not make Italy's economy similar to that of Germany or Denmark. Germany has a highly industrialized and diverse economy, while Denmark has a mixed economy with a strong welfare state. Italy, even without Lombardy, would still have a different economic structure compared to these countries.

3. **Culture**: Italy has a unique cultural heritage that is distinct from both Germany and Denmark. This includes language, cuisine, art, and historical influences. Lombardy contributes to this cultural diversity, but its absence would not make Italy culturally similar to Germany or Denmark.

4. **Historical Context**: Italy, Germany, and Denmark have different historical backgrounds. Italy's history is deeply rooted in the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, and various regional influences. Germany's history includes the Holy Roman Empire, Prussian influence, and reunification, while Denmark has a history as a Viking nation and a constitutional monarchy. Removing Lombardy does not align Italy's historical context with that of Germany or Denmark.

Given these considerations, the claim that ""Without Lombardy, Italy is (almost) like Germany and Denmark"" is not accurate in terms of geography, economy, culture, or historical context.

“El Estado gastó $7 mil millones en Fútbol Para Todos”,true,es,"""The State spent $7 billion on Football for All.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The State spent $7 billion on Football for All,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Identify where this claim originated. Is it from a credible source such as a government report, a reputable news outlet, or an official statement?

2. **Context and Details**: Understand what ""Football for All"" refers to. Is it a specific program, initiative, or event? What are the details of this program, and what does the spending entail?

3. **Financial Records**: Check the financial records or official statements from the state government regarding expenditures on the ""Football for All"" program. This could include budget reports, financial audits, or official press releases.

4. **Time Frame**: Determine the time frame over which the $7 billion was supposedly spent. Is it a single fiscal year, multiple years, or a specific period?

Without access to specific data or sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to how one might assess it.

If the claim is found in a credible source and the financial records support that the state indeed allocated $7 billion to a program called ""Football for All,"" then the claim would be 'True'. If the amount is close but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the amount is significantly different or the context is misrepresented, it could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the methodology described, you can apply this approach to verify the claim.

1. **Historical Context**: The claim references a specific time frame (since 1996) and a specific type of debt (foreign currency debt) issued by developing countries.
2. **Verification**: We would need to verify if there have been any larger foreign currency debt issuances by developing countries since 1996.

Without specific data on all foreign currency debt issuances by developing countries since 1996, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date financial data, it could be considered plausible.

Given the lack of specific data to either fully confirm or refute the claim, the most balanced assessment would be:

According to the World Bank and other reputable sources, as of recent years, Guinea has made some progress in electrification. The World Bank data from 2019 indicates that the electrification rate in Guinea was around 18.1%.

Maroni e le spese per consulenze della Lombardia,mostly true,it,Maroni and the consultancy expenses of Lombardy.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Maroni and the consultancy expenses of Lombardy,"" we need to examine the context and details surrounding it. Roberto Maroni, a prominent Italian politician, served as the President of the Lombardy region from 2013 to 2018. During his tenure, there were various reports and investigations related to consultancy expenses and potential misuse of public funds.

If the claim refers to allegations or confirmed instances of irregularities in consultancy expenses during Maroni's administration, it would be important to verify the specific details and outcomes of any investigations or audits conducted.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim provided, it is challenging to definitively categorize it without further context. However, based on historical reports and investigations into public spending during Maroni's tenure, it is reasonable to infer that there were at least some concerns or controversies.

"Le donne guadagnano meno degli uomini: sì, ecco il perché",mostly true,it,"Women earn less than men: yes, here's why.","The claim ""Women earn less than men"" is generally supported by a substantial body of research and data. According to various studies and reports, including those from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the World Economic Forum, women on average earn less than men. This wage gap can be attributed to a variety of factors, including but not limited to occupational segregation, differences in work experience, education, and potential discrimination.

However, the reasons behind the wage gap are complex and multifaceted. While some of the gap can be explained by differences in industry, job role, and work experience, a portion of it remains unexplained and is often attributed to gender discrimination.

Given the overwhelming evidence supporting the existence of a wage gap, the claim ""Women earn less than men"" is accurate. The reasons for this gap are varied and complex, but the fundamental claim holds true.

Pas de recours au vaccin contre la tuberculose aux Etats-Unis,mostly true,fr,No use of the tuberculosis vaccine in the United States.,"The claim 'No use of the tuberculosis vaccine in the United States' is not entirely accurate. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which is used to protect against tuberculosis (TB), is not commonly used in the United States. The U.S. does not routinely vaccinate the general population with the BCG vaccine because TB is not as prevalent there as in other parts of the world, and the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing pulmonary TB in adults is variable. However, the BCG vaccine is sometimes used in specific situations, such as for certain individuals who are at high risk of TB exposure or for healthcare workers in particular settings.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, I do not have specific data on the exact contribution of the digital sector to Côte d'Ivoire's GDP and tax revenues. However, the digital sector is known to be a growing part of many economies, including Côte d'Ivoire, due to increasing digitalization and the expansion of ICT services.

“El conurbano tiene intendentes que gobiernan sus distritos hace 15 años en promedio”,half true,es,"""The conurbation has mayors who have been governing their districts for an average of 15 years.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The conurbation has mayors who have been governing their districts for an average of 15 years,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Definition of Conurbation**: A conurbation is an extended urban area, typically consisting of several towns merging with the suburbs of one or more cities.

2. **Average Tenure of Mayors**: The claim states that the average tenure of mayors in this conurbation is 15 years. This implies that if you take the total number of years all the mayors have been in office and divide it by the number of mayors, the result should be 15 years.

Without specific data on the tenure of each mayor in the conurbation, it is impossible to verify the exact average. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, it could be considered true. If there is any doubt or lack of data, the claim could be less certain.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate response would be to consider it as 'Half True' because it is a statement that could be accurate but lacks the necessary evidence for full verification.

Il n’existe aucun pays où le chef de l’Etat sortant participe à un débat télévisé avec d'autres candidats dans le cadre d'une élection présidentielle.,false,fr,There is no country where the outgoing head of state participates in a televised debate with other candidates as part of a presidential election.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider whether there are any countries where the outgoing head of state (i.e., the current president or equivalent) participates in televised debates with other candidates during a presidential election.

In the United States, for example, it is common for sitting presidents who are running for re-election to participate in televised debates with their challengers. This has been observed in multiple election cycles, such as when President Barack Obama debated Mitt Romney in 2012, and when President Donald Trump debated Joe Biden in 2020.

Similarly, in other democratic countries, it is not unusual for the incumbent head of state to engage in televised debates if they are seeking re-election. Examples can be found in countries like France, where sitting presidents have participated in debates during their re-election campaigns.

Given these examples, the claim that ""There is no country where the outgoing head of state participates in a televised debate with other candidates as part of a presidential election"" is not accurate.

“Cada tres minutos una familia recibe un crédito hipotecario a 30 años del Banco Nación”,half true,es,"""Every three minutes a family receives a 30-year mortgage loan from Banco Nación.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Every three minutes a family receives a 30-year mortgage loan from Banco Nación,"" we need to analyze the data and context behind it.

1. **Mathematical Calculation**:
   - There are 1,440 minutes in a day (24 hours * 60 minutes).
   - If a family receives a mortgage every three minutes, that would mean 1,440 / 3 = 480 mortgages per day.
   - Over a year, this would amount to 480 * 365 = 175,200 mortgages.

2. **Feasibility**:
   - Banco Nación is a major bank in Argentina, but issuing 175,200 mortgages annually is an extremely high number.
   - For comparison, large banks in major economies typically issue fewer mortgages annually.

3. **Verification**:
   - Without specific data from Banco Nación or an authoritative source confirming this rate of mortgage issuance, it is difficult to verify the claim.
   - The claim seems exaggerated given the typical volume of mortgage loans processed by even the largest banks.

Based on the above analysis, the claim appears to be highly unlikely and exaggerated.

According to historical data from sources such as the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP was approximately 6.7% in 2011. By 2019, the budget deficit had indeed decreased, but the exact percentage for 2019 was around 4.6%, not 3.7%.

Given this information, the claim is not entirely accurate but does reflect a significant decrease in the budget deficit over the specified period.

"Non usiamo il contante più di tutti gli altri, ma...",half true,it,"We don't use cash more than everyone else, but...","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We don't use cash more than everyone else, but...,"" we need to consider the context and the comparison being made. The phrase ""more than everyone else"" implies a comparison with a broad group, potentially on a global scale or within a specific region or demographic.

1. **Global Context**: If the claim is made in a global context, it would depend on the specific country or region being referred to. For example, some countries like Sweden and South Korea have significantly reduced their use of cash, while others still rely heavily on it.

2. **Regional Context**: If the claim is made within a specific region, such as a country or a community, the comparison would be more localized. For instance, within the United States, urban areas might use less cash compared to rural areas.

3. **Demographic Context**: Different age groups or socioeconomic classes might have varying levels of cash usage. Younger generations might prefer digital payments, while older generations might still use cash more frequently.

Without additional context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given the general trend towards digital payments and the fact that many regions and demographics are moving away from cash, the claim could be seen as somewhat accurate but not universally true.

COVID-19 (...) 5 months""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the historical context and development timelines for both typhoid fever and COVID-19 vaccines.

1. **Typhoid Fever Vaccine:**
   - The first typhoid vaccine was developed by Almroth Wright in 1896.
   - Modern typhoid vaccines, such as the Vi polysaccharide vaccine, were developed much later, with significant advancements in the 20th century.
   - If we consider the time from the first vaccine to the development of more effective modern vaccines, it spans several decades, but not necessarily 105 years.

2. **COVID-19 Vaccine:**
   - The COVID-19 pandemic began in late 2019.
   - The first COVID-19 vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, received emergency use authorization in December 2020.
   - This development timeline was indeed around 5 months from the start of large-scale clinical trials to emergency use authorization.

Given this information:

- The claim that it took 105 years to develop a typhoid fever vaccine is an oversimplification. The initial vaccine was developed in 1896, but modern vaccines were developed over a much shorter period within the 20th century.
- The claim that the COVID-19 vaccine was developed in 5 months is accurate in the context of the rapid development and emergency use authorization process.

Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and somewhat misleading regarding the typhoid fever vaccine timeline, but accurate for the COVID-19 vaccine.

According to data from the World Bank and other economic sources, Africa's GDP growth rates have varied over the years. From 2000 to 2015, Africa experienced periods of strong growth, particularly in the early 2000s and mid-2000s, driven by factors such as high commodity prices, increased foreign investment, and improvements in governance and economic policies. However, the growth rates were not consistently near 5% every year.

For example:
- In the early 2000s, Africa's GDP growth rates were often above 5%.
- During the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, growth rates slowed down significantly.
- Post-crisis, growth rates picked up again but varied by year and region.

On average, the continent's growth rate was close to 5% over the 15-year period, but it was not consistently at that level every year.

Given this context, the claim that Africa's GDP had been growing by nearly 5% for 15 years is somewhat accurate but not entirely precise.

"La Guinée est en train de devenir le premier producteur mondial de bauxite. Elle détient la moitié des réserves mondiales de ce minerai, a dit son président Alpha Condé.",half true,fr,"Guinea is becoming the world's leading producer of bauxite. It holds half of the world's reserves of this mineral, said its president Alpha Condé.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points: Guinea's position as the world's leading producer of bauxite and whether it holds half of the world's reserves of this mineral.

1. **Guinea's Position as the World's Leading Producer of Bauxite:**
   - Guinea is indeed one of the top producers of bauxite globally. According to recent data, it has been increasing its production significantly and is among the top producers, often competing with Australia for the leading position.

2. **Guinea Holding Half of the World's Reserves:**
   - Guinea is known to have one of the largest reserves of bauxite in the world. However, saying it holds ""half"" of the world's reserves is an exaggeration. Estimates suggest that Guinea holds around a quarter to a third of the world's known bauxite reserves, not half.

Given these points, the claim that Guinea is becoming the world's leading producer of bauxite is largely accurate, but the statement that it holds half of the world's reserves is an overstatement.

"“La inflación en 80 años ha sido, en promedio, 62,5% sin contar los años de hiperinflación”",half true,es,"""Inflation over 80 years has averaged 62.5% excluding the years of hyperinflation.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Inflation over 80 years has averaged 62.5% excluding the years of hyperinflation,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of Hyperinflation**: Hyperinflation is typically defined as an extremely high and typically accelerating inflation, often exceeding 50% per month. This is a rare occurrence and usually happens in specific countries during periods of severe economic crisis.

2. **Historical Inflation Data**: Over the past 80 years, inflation rates have varied significantly across different countries and time periods. For example, in the United States, the average annual inflation rate over the past 80 years has been much lower than 62.5%. According to historical data, the average annual inflation rate in the U.S. from 1940 to 2020 is approximately 3-4%.

3. **Exclusion of Hyperinflation Years**: If we exclude years of hyperinflation, the average inflation rate would generally be lower, not higher, because hyperinflation years tend to skew the average upwards.

Given these points, the claim that ""Inflation over 80 years has averaged 62.5% excluding the years of hyperinflation"" seems highly unlikely and inconsistent with historical data for most countries. The average annual inflation rate, excluding hyperinflation periods, would typically be much lower than 62.5%.

Paragone sbaglia sulla crescita dell’Eurozona,false,it,Paragone is wrong about the growth of the Eurozone.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Paragone is wrong about the growth of the Eurozone,"" we need to consider the context and specific statements made by Paragone regarding the Eurozone's growth. Since the claim is a general statement without specific details, it is challenging to evaluate its truthfulness without additional context.

However, if we assume that Paragone made a statement about the Eurozone's growth that is factually incorrect based on available economic data, we can assess the claim accordingly. For instance, if Paragone stated that the Eurozone is not growing when economic indicators show positive growth, the claim would be 'True.'

Given the lack of specific information about Paragone's statements, we can only make a general assessment based on the assumption that the claim refers to a factual inaccuracy.

Ao longo dos últimos dias espalhou-se pelas redes sociais a imagem de......,half true,pt,"Over the past few days, the image of...... has spread across social media.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Over the past few days, the image of...... has spread across social media,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. **Time Frame**: Confirm that the image in question has indeed been circulating over the past few days.
2. **Platform Verification**: Check multiple social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) to see if the image has been widely shared.
3. **Engagement Metrics**: Look at the number of shares, likes, comments, and other engagement metrics to gauge the spread of the image.

Without specific details about the image and access to current social media data, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided:

Il salario minimo italiano sarebbe il più generoso tra i Paesi Ocse?,half true,it,Would the Italian minimum wage be the most generous among OECD countries?,"To determine whether the claim that the Italian minimum wage would be the most generous among OECD countries is accurate, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Status**: As of the latest information, Italy does not have a statutory national minimum wage. Instead, wages are typically set through collective bargaining agreements between unions and employers.

2. **Comparison with Other OECD Countries**: Among OECD countries, several have statutory minimum wages that are relatively high. For example, Luxembourg, Australia, and France are known for having some of the highest minimum wages when adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP).

3. **Hypothetical Scenario**: If Italy were to introduce a minimum wage, its generosity would depend on the specific amount set and how it compares to the minimum wages in other OECD countries. Without a specific figure, it's speculative to claim it would be the most generous.

Given these points, the claim lacks a concrete basis and is speculative. Therefore, it cannot be considered accurate.

La Côte d'Ivoire est le premier producteur et le premier exportateur africain de noix de cajou.,half true,fr,Ivory Coast is the leading producer and exporter of cashew nuts in Africa.,"Ivory Coast, also known as Côte d'Ivoire, is indeed one of the leading producers and exporters of cashew nuts in Africa. The country has made significant strides in the cashew industry and has become a major player on the continent. However, it is important to verify the most recent data to ensure the accuracy of this claim.

Based on available information up to 2023, Ivory Coast is often cited as the top producer and exporter of cashew nuts in Africa, surpassing other major producers on the continent.

Calenda ha ragione su crescita dell'export e dell'occupazione al Sud,mostly true,it,Calenda is right about the growth of exports and employment in the South.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Calenda is right about the growth of exports and employment in the South,"" we would need to verify the specific data and context regarding exports and employment in the southern region being referred to. This involves checking recent statistics and reports on economic performance, export growth, and employment trends in that area.

Without access to the specific data and context, it is not possible to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verified and accurate data, we could consider it to be true. Conversely, if the data does not support the claim, it would be false.

Given the lack of specific information and data in the provided context, I cannot make a definitive judgment.

El déficit de Aerolíneas ocupa cinco veces más que todo el presupuesto del Ministerio de Industria,half true,es,The deficit of Aerolíneas is five times larger than the entire budget of the Ministry of Industry.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The deficit of Aerolíneas is five times larger than the entire budget of the Ministry of Industry,"" we need to compare the actual figures for both the deficit of Aerolíneas and the budget of the Ministry of Industry.

1. **Aerolíneas Deficit**: We need the most recent and reliable data on the financial deficit of Aerolíneas Argentinas. This information is typically available in the company's financial statements or government reports.

2. **Ministry of Industry Budget**: Similarly, we need the latest budget figures for the Ministry of Industry, which can be found in government budget documents or official financial reports.

Without the specific figures, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date data, we can analyze the plausibility:

- If the deficit of Aerolíneas is indeed five times larger than the Ministry of Industry's budget, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the deficit is somewhat close but not exactly five times larger, it might be 'Mostly True'.
- If the deficit is significantly different but still comparable, it could be 'Half True'.
- If the deficit is much smaller or larger than claimed, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, we cannot make a definitive judgment. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on some factual data, we might lean towards a middle-ground assessment.

Les parts de marché de la France au Sénégal on baissé de 25% au Sénégal en dix ans.,half true,fr,The market share of France in Senegal has decreased by 25% over ten years.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The market share of France in Senegal has decreased by 25% over ten years,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. **Historical Market Share Data**: We need data on France's market share in Senegal from ten years ago and the current market share.
2. **Calculation of Decrease**: We need to calculate the percentage decrease in market share over the ten-year period.

Without access to specific data sources or statistical reports, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and reliable data, we can evaluate it as follows:

- If the data shows a decrease of exactly 25%, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the data shows a decrease close to 25% but not exactly, the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- If the data shows a decrease that is somewhat significant but not close to 25%, the claim would be 'Half True'.
- If the data shows a minimal decrease or an increase, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the question and assuming the claim is based on some level of accurate data, I would lean towards 'Mostly True' as a cautious evaluation.

“La reducción de las salideras bancarias está en el orden del 80%”,mostly true,es,"""The reduction in bank robberies is around 80%.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The reduction in bank robberies is around 80%,"" we need to consider the context and available data. 

1. **Historical Data**: If we look at historical data, there has been a significant decline in bank robberies over the past few decades. For example, in the United States, the FBI reported a steady decrease in bank robberies from the 1990s to the 2010s.

2. **Recent Trends**: More recent data from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies indicate that bank robberies have continued to decline, although the exact percentage can vary year by year.

3. **Verification**: To verify the specific claim of an 80% reduction, we would need to compare specific time periods. For instance, if we compare the number of bank robberies in the 1990s to the number in the 2020s, an 80% reduction might be plausible based on available data.

Given the general trend of a significant reduction in bank robberies, but without precise numbers to confirm the exact 80% figure, the claim seems to be largely accurate but may not be exact.

"A polícia, durante a intervenção, mata seis pessoas por dia",half true,pt,"The police, during interventions, kill six people per day.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The police, during interventions, kill six people per day,"" we need to look at reliable data sources on police-related fatalities.

In the United States, data from sources like The Washington Post's ""Fatal Force"" database and the Mapping Police Violence project provide insights into the number of people killed by police. According to these sources, the number of people killed by police in the U.S. has been around 1,000 per year in recent years. 

If we take 1,000 deaths per year and divide by 365 days, we get approximately 2.74 deaths per day. This is significantly lower than the claim of six people per day.

A revelação é inspiradora: J. K. Rowling saiu da lista dos mais ricos......,mostly true,pt,The revelation is inspiring: J. K. Rowling is no longer on the list of the richest......,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that J.K. Rowling is no longer on the list of the richest, we need to consider the most recent and reliable sources of information about her net worth and rankings on wealth lists.

J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, has been known to be one of the wealthiest authors in the world. However, her position on wealth lists can fluctuate due to various factors such as charitable donations, changes in the valuation of her assets, and the performance of her business ventures.

As of my last update in 2023, J.K. Rowling has made significant charitable donations, which have impacted her net worth. However, she still remains a very wealthy individual. Whether she is currently on a specific list of the richest people can vary depending on the criteria and the source of the list.

Without access to the most current data, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, given her substantial wealth, it is unlikely that she has completely fallen off all lists of the richest individuals.

Le Nigeria compte 23% des cas de paludisme enregistrés dans le monde.,half true,fr,Nigeria accounts for 23% of the recorded malaria cases in the world.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Nigeria accounts for 23% of the recorded malaria cases in the world,"" we need to refer to reliable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or other reputable health organizations that track malaria statistics.

According to the World Malaria Report 2021 published by the WHO, Nigeria accounted for 27% of global malaria cases in 2020. This figure is slightly higher than the 23% mentioned in the claim.

Given this information, the claim is close to the actual figure but not entirely accurate.

La Côte d'Ivoire figure parmi les 20 pays qui ont les systèmes de santé les moins performants au monde.,true,fr,Ivory Coast is among the 20 countries with the least efficient healthcare systems in the world.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Ivory Coast is among the 20 countries with the least efficient healthcare systems in the world,"" we need to look at reliable sources and rankings that evaluate healthcare efficiency globally.

Healthcare efficiency can be measured by various factors, including healthcare outcomes, cost efficiency, accessibility, and quality of care. Organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), Bloomberg, and other health research institutions often publish reports and rankings on healthcare systems.

1. **Bloomberg Health-Care Efficiency Index**: This index ranks countries based on life expectancy, healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP, and absolute per capita healthcare spending. In recent years, Ivory Coast has not been prominently featured in the top or bottom of these rankings, suggesting it may not be among the very least efficient.

2. **World Health Organization (WHO)**: The WHO provides comprehensive data on healthcare systems, but it does not typically rank countries in terms of efficiency in a single list. However, it does highlight areas where countries may struggle, such as access to care, quality of services, and health outcomes.

3. **Other Reports and Studies**: Various other studies and reports may provide insights into the efficiency of healthcare systems. For example, the Global Burden of Disease study and reports from organizations like the World Bank can offer data on healthcare performance.

Given the available data, Ivory Coast does face significant challenges in its healthcare system, including limited access to care, lower healthcare spending, and poorer health outcomes compared to more developed nations. However, there is no definitive, widely-accepted ranking that places Ivory Coast explicitly among the 20 least efficient healthcare systems globally.

Renzi esagera sulle rinunce del Pd rispetto al M5S,false,it,Renzi exaggerates about the sacrifices made by the PD compared to the M5S.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Renzi exaggerates about the sacrifices made by the PD compared to the M5S,"" we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding the statement. 

1. **Context**: Matteo Renzi is a prominent figure in Italian politics and a member of the Democratic Party (PD). The PD and the Five Star Movement (M5S) have had various political interactions, including coalition governments. Renzi's statement likely refers to the compromises and concessions made by the PD in these political contexts.

2. **Evidence**: 
   - **PD's Sacrifices**: The PD has made several political compromises, such as forming coalitions with M5S despite ideological differences, supporting policies that may not align perfectly with their platform, and making leadership changes to maintain political stability.
   - **M5S's Sacrifices**: The M5S has also made significant compromises, such as agreeing to coalition governments with traditional parties like the PD, which goes against their original anti-establishment stance, and supporting policies that diverge from their initial populist agenda.

3. **Analysis**: 
   - If Renzi claims that the PD has made more sacrifices than the M5S, it could be seen as an exaggeration if both parties have made comparable concessions.
   - Without specific metrics or a detailed comparison of the sacrifices made by each party, it is challenging to definitively state that one party has sacrificed more than the other.

Given the information, Renzi's statement appears to be an exaggeration because both parties have made significant sacrifices, and claiming that one has made more without concrete evidence leans towards overstating the situation.

“Sembramos el mismo trigo que hace 100 años”,true,es,"""We plant the same wheat as 100 years ago.""","To evaluate the claim ""We plant the same wheat as 100 years ago,"" we need to consider the advancements and changes in agricultural practices and wheat varieties over the past century.

1. **Genetic Modification and Breeding**: Over the past 100 years, there have been significant advancements in plant breeding and genetics. Modern wheat varieties have been selectively bred for higher yields, disease resistance, and other desirable traits. This means that the wheat planted today is genetically different from the wheat planted 100 years ago.

2. **Agricultural Practices**: Farming techniques have also evolved, including the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and modern machinery, which have all contributed to changes in the way wheat is grown.

3. **Heirloom Varieties**: While some heirloom or heritage wheat varieties are still grown today, they represent a small fraction of the total wheat production. Most commercial wheat comes from modern varieties developed through scientific breeding programs.

Given these points, the claim that ""We plant the same wheat as 100 years ago"" is not accurate. While some traditional varieties may still exist, the majority of wheat planted today is different due to advancements in breeding and agricultural practices.

"En Afrique subsaharienne, plus de 5% des naissances surviennent pendant l'adolescence, selon l'OMS",false,fr,"In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 5% of births occur during adolescence, according to the WHO.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 5% of births occur during adolescence, according to the WHO,"" we need to refer to reliable data sources, such as reports and statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO).

According to WHO data, adolescent birth rates in sub-Saharan Africa are indeed high. The region has one of the highest rates of adolescent pregnancies in the world. Specifically, the adolescent birth rate in sub-Saharan Africa is significantly higher than 5%. For instance, the WHO reports that in some countries within the region, the adolescent birth rate can be as high as 100 births per 1,000 girls aged 15-19.

Given this information, the claim that more than 5% of births occur during adolescence in sub-Saharan Africa is accurate.

"“Si uno mira el presupuesto de este año, ha sido solamente ejecutado en un 12%”",mostly true,es,"""If one looks at this year's budget, it has only been executed at 12%.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""If one looks at this year's budget, it has only been executed at 12%,"" we would need to verify the actual budget execution data for the current year. This involves checking official financial reports or statements from the relevant government or organizational body responsible for the budget.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to assess it:

1. **Source Verification**: Check the source of the claim. Is it from a credible and reliable entity?
2. **Official Reports**: Look for the latest budget execution reports from the relevant authority (e.g., government finance department, organizational financial statements).
3. **Context**: Understand the context in which the claim was made. Is it referring to a specific part of the budget (e.g., capital expenditure, operational costs) or the overall budget?

If the claim is found in a credible source and matches the official reports, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If it partially matches or is taken out of context, it might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'. If it is completely inaccurate, it would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data here, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to the relevant budget execution data, you can compare it to the claim to determine its accuracy.

How much do the Netherlands ""weigh"" in the European Union?","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A Lilliput? How much do the Netherlands 'weigh' in the European Union?"", we need to consider the context and the metrics used to measure the influence or ""weight"" of the Netherlands within the EU.

1. **Population and Voting Power**: The Netherlands is one of the smaller countries in the EU by population, which affects its voting power in the Council of the European Union. However, it still has a significant number of votes and representation in the European Parliament.

2. **Economic Influence**: The Netherlands has a strong economy and is one of the largest contributors to the EU budget. Its economic influence is substantial compared to its size.

3. **Political Influence**: The Netherlands is an active member of the EU and often plays a significant role in policy discussions and decision-making processes.

Given these points, the term ""Lilliput"" might suggest that the Netherlands has a minor or insignificant role, which is not entirely accurate. While it is smaller in population compared to countries like Germany or France, its economic and political influence is considerable.

People have expressed doubts via Twitter.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The unemployment rate in Nigeria is 18.8%, according to the Spectator Index,"" we need to verify the unemployment rate in Nigeria and the credibility of the Spectator Index as a source.

1. **Unemployment Rate Verification**:
   - The unemployment rate in Nigeria has been reported by various sources, including the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of Nigeria. As of the latest available data, the unemployment rate in Nigeria has been fluctuating and has been reported to be significantly higher than 18.8% in recent years. For instance, the NBS reported an unemployment rate of around 33.3% in Q4 2020.

2. **Source Credibility**:
   - The Spectator Index is a social media account that shares various statistics and data points. While it has a following, it is not an official statistical body and its data should be cross-verified with official sources.

3. **Public Reaction**:
   - The claim mentions that people have expressed doubts via Twitter. This is plausible as social media often hosts a variety of opinions and skepticism, especially regarding statistical data.

Given the discrepancy between the reported unemployment rate by official sources like the NBS and the figure provided by the Spectator Index, the claim that the unemployment rate is 18.8% is not accurate based on the most recent and reliable data.

As of the latest available data, Nigeria's total public debt, which includes both domestic and external debt, has been reported to be around $80 billion. However, it is important to note that this figure represents the cumulative debt of the country and not just the debt incurred by the current government alone. The debt has been accumulated over several administrations.

"Por ocasião do referendo de 2005, o povo decidiu pela compra (...) de armas e munições",true,pt,"'On the occasion of the 2005 referendum, the people decided in favor of the purchase (...) of weapons and ammunition.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the context and details of the 2005 referendum. In 2005, Brazil held a referendum on whether to ban the sale of firearms and ammunition to civilians. The result was that the majority of voters decided against the ban, meaning they voted to allow the continued sale of firearms and ammunition.

The claim states that ""the people decided in favor of the purchase (...) of weapons and ammunition."" This is a somewhat misleading way to phrase the outcome. The referendum was about whether to ban sales, not directly about purchasing. However, the result did mean that people could continue to purchase weapons and ammunition.

A violência contra a mulher atinge mais as negras,true,pt,Violence against women affects Black women more.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Violence against women affects Black women more,"" we need to consider statistical data and research findings on the prevalence and impact of violence against women across different racial and ethnic groups.

1. **Prevalence of Violence**: Studies and reports from organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) indicate that Black women experience higher rates of certain types of violence compared to women of other racial and ethnic groups. For example, Black women are disproportionately affected by intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and homicide.

2. **Impact of Violence**: The impact of violence on Black women can be more severe due to intersecting factors such as systemic racism, economic disparities, and limited access to resources and support services. These factors can exacerbate the consequences of violence and make it more challenging for Black women to seek help and recover.

3. **Comparative Data**: According to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS), Black women report higher lifetime prevalence rates of rape, physical violence, and stalking by an intimate partner compared to white women and women of other racial groups.

Given this information, the claim that ""Violence against women affects Black women more"" is supported by data showing higher prevalence rates and more severe impacts of violence on Black women.

Quanti furti ci sono ogni giorno in Italia?,mostly true,it,How many thefts are there every day in Italy?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim about the number of thefts in Italy every day, we need to look at reliable crime statistics from official sources such as the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) or reports from law enforcement agencies.

As of the most recent data available, Italy has experienced fluctuations in crime rates, including thefts. For instance, in 2019, ISTAT reported approximately 1.2 million thefts in Italy. To find the daily average, we can divide this annual figure by 365 days:

1,200,000 thefts / 365 days ≈ 3,288 thefts per day.

This calculation provides a rough estimate, and the actual number can vary year by year. However, without a specific number provided in the claim, it's challenging to assess its exact truthfulness. If the claim suggests a number close to this estimate, it would be considered accurate.

2. **Data Verification**: Official records or statements from relevant authorities (e.g., police departments, government agencies) should be reviewed to confirm the numbers.
3. **Scope and Metrics**: The claim should be evaluated based on specific metrics such as the number of new recruits, the extent of the renewal efforts, and the overall impact.

Without specific data or historical comparisons, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if the claim is made by a credible source and there is no substantial evidence to the contrary, it might lean towards being 'Mostly True'.

In many developing countries, the rate was extremely low, while in developed countries, it was higher. However, a global average of 3% seems too low. More accurate estimates suggest that the global female literacy rate in 1960 was around 40-50%.

2. **Current Literacy Rate of Women**: According to the latest data from UNESCO and other educational organizations, the global literacy rate for women has significantly improved and is now around 83-90%. This is a substantial increase from 1960.

Given these points, the claim that only 3% of women were literate in 1960 is likely an exaggeration, and the current literacy rate being 46-47% is also significantly understated.

"No, non possiamo accusare il governo di togliere alla scuola per dare ai pensionati",false,it,"No, we cannot accuse the government of taking away from schools to give to pensioners.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""No, we cannot accuse the government of taking away from schools to give to pensioners,"" we need to consider the context and evidence regarding government budget allocations and policies. 

1. **Budget Allocation**: Governments typically have separate budget lines for education and pensions. If there is no direct evidence that funds specifically allocated for schools are being redirected to pensions, the claim would lean towards being true.

2. **Policy Statements**: If government officials or budget documents explicitly state that funds are not being reallocated from schools to pensions, this would support the claim.

3. **Public Perception vs. Reality**: Sometimes public perception may be that one area is being neglected in favor of another, but without concrete evidence, this remains speculative.

4. **Economic Context**: In times of economic strain, governments may cut budgets across various sectors, but this does not necessarily mean that funds are being taken from one specific area to fund another.

Given these points, unless there is specific evidence showing that the government is indeed reallocating funds from schools to pensions, the claim would be considered accurate.

L’Italia rischia di perdere oltre 60 milioni di turisti stranieri,true,it,Italy risks losing over 60 million foreign tourists.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Italy risks losing over 60 million foreign tourists,"" we need to consider the context and available data.

1. **Context**: The claim could be related to a specific event or period, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted global travel and tourism.

2. **Data**: According to data from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and other tourism reports, Italy typically receives around 60-65 million foreign tourists annually. During the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions and health concerns led to a dramatic decrease in international travel.

3. **Verification**: If the claim is made during a period of significant travel disruption (like the pandemic), it is plausible that Italy could risk losing over 60 million foreign tourists in a year.

Given this context, the claim appears to be accurate if it refers to a period of significant travel disruption.

“Dicen que van a gravar la renta pero en realidad van a gravar la rentita”,true,es,"""They say they are going to tax income, but in reality, they are going to tax the small income.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and specifics of the tax policy being referenced. The statement suggests that while the intention is to tax income in general, the actual implementation disproportionately affects those with smaller incomes.

1. **True**: This would mean that the tax policy explicitly or effectively targets small incomes more than larger ones.
2. **Mostly True**: This would mean that while the policy does tax all incomes, the burden falls more heavily on those with smaller incomes.
3. **Half True**: This would mean that the policy taxes all incomes, but there is some evidence that smaller incomes are somewhat more affected.
4. **Mostly False**: This would mean that the policy taxes all incomes fairly, but there might be minor aspects that slightly affect smaller incomes more.
5. **False**: This would mean that the policy taxes all incomes fairly and does not disproportionately affect smaller incomes.

Without specific details about the tax policy in question, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume a general context where progressive tax systems are common (where higher incomes are taxed at higher rates), the claim would likely be misleading.

“El crédito duplicó su participación en el PBI entre 2003 y 2013”,half true,es,"""Credit doubled its share of GDP between 2003 and 2013.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Credit doubled its share of GDP between 2003 and 2013,"" we need to examine data on credit as a percentage of GDP over that period. This involves looking at reliable sources such as reports from central banks, financial institutions, or international organizations like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on the credit-to-GDP ratio for the years 2003 and 2013.
2. **Analysis**: Compare the credit-to-GDP ratio in 2003 with that in 2013 to see if it indeed doubled.

Without specific data at hand, I can provide a general approach based on typical trends observed in many economies during that period. The early 2000s saw significant credit growth in many countries, often driven by economic expansion and financial innovation. The 2008 financial crisis, however, led to a contraction in credit markets, followed by various recovery efforts.

Given these factors, it is plausible that credit as a share of GDP could have increased significantly, but whether it exactly doubled would require precise data.

**Example Data Analysis**:
- If the credit-to-GDP ratio was 50% in 2003 and increased to 100% in 2013, the claim would be true.
- If it increased from 50% to 75%, the claim would be mostly true.
- If it increased from 50% to 60%, the claim would be half true.
- If it increased from 50% to 55%, the claim would be mostly false.
- If it did not increase or decreased, the claim would be false.

**Hypothetical Data**:
- 2003: Credit-to-GDP ratio = 60%
- 2013: Credit-to-GDP ratio = 120%

In this hypothetical scenario, the claim would be true.

**Conclusion**:
Without specific data, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general trends and the need for precise data, I would lean towards a cautious assessment.

“El delito aumenta cada vez más en la provincia de Buenos Aires”,half true,es,"""Crime is increasing more and more in the province of Buenos Aires.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Crime is increasing more and more in the province of Buenos Aires,"" we need to examine recent crime statistics and trends in the region. 

1. **Official Crime Statistics**: Check the latest crime reports from official sources such as the Ministry of Security of the Province of Buenos Aires or other relevant governmental bodies. These reports typically provide data on various types of crimes, including violent crimes, property crimes, and other offenses.

2. **Trends Over Time**: Analyze whether there has been a consistent increase in crime rates over recent years. This involves looking at year-over-year changes in crime statistics.

3. **Contextual Factors**: Consider any external factors that might influence crime rates, such as economic conditions, law enforcement policies, and social changes.

Without access to the most recent and specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a general perception or anecdotal evidence rather than concrete data, it might not fully capture the complexity of crime trends.

**Hypothetical Analysis**:
- If recent official reports indicate a clear and consistent rise in crime rates across multiple categories, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the data shows mixed trends, with some types of crime increasing while others are decreasing or stable, the claim might be 'Half True'.
- If the data shows a decrease in crime rates or no significant change, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the need for specific data to make an accurate determination, and assuming we don't have access to the latest statistics:

The Ideb is a measure used in Brazil to evaluate the quality of education in public schools, and it provides rankings based on performance in early and later grades of elementary school.

1. **Check the latest Ideb data**: Access the most recent Ideb results for Aracaju's public schools.
2. **Compare rankings**: Verify if Aracaju's public schools are indeed ranked last in the early grades and third to last in the later grades.

Without access to the specific Ideb data, I cannot definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if the data supports the rankings mentioned, the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows slightly different rankings, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the rankings are significantly different, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the need for precise data verification, I recommend checking the latest Ideb results for Aracaju to make an accurate determination.

“La relación entre los delitos cometidos y las personas condenadas es menor al 1%”,mostly true,es,"""The relationship between the crimes committed and the people convicted is less than 1%.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The relationship between the crimes committed and the people convicted is less than 1%,"" we need to consider several factors, including crime reporting rates, clearance rates, and conviction rates.

1. **Crime Reporting Rates**: Not all crimes are reported to law enforcement. For example, many instances of sexual assault, domestic violence, and minor thefts go unreported.

2. **Clearance Rates**: This refers to the percentage of reported crimes that are ""cleared"" by the police, either through arrest or other means. Clearance rates vary by type of crime and jurisdiction.

3. **Conviction Rates**: Of the crimes that are reported and cleared, not all result in a conviction. Some cases are dismissed, some result in acquittals, and some are resolved through plea bargains.

Given these factors, the actual percentage of crimes that result in a conviction is indeed quite low, but it is generally higher than 1%. For example, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program provides data on clearance rates, and while these rates vary, they are typically higher than 1% for many types of crimes. Additionally, once a crime is cleared and a suspect is arrested, the conviction rate is also higher than 1%.

Therefore, the claim that the relationship between the crimes committed and the people convicted is less than 1% is an exaggeration.

“El 44% de los subsidios se lo llevan las dos décimas partes de la población más rica”,half true,es,"""44% of the subsidies go to the richest 20% of the population.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""44% of the subsidies go to the richest 20% of the population,"" we need to consider the context and the source of the data. Subsidies can refer to a wide range of government financial support, including agricultural subsidies, energy subsidies, housing subsidies, and more. The distribution of these subsidies can vary significantly depending on the type and the country in question.

If we assume the claim is referring to a specific type of subsidy or a specific country, we would need to verify the data from a reliable source such as government reports, research studies, or reputable news organizations. For example, in the context of agricultural subsidies in the United States, it has been reported that a significant portion of these subsidies does go to wealthier farmers and large agribusinesses. However, without specific data or a clear context, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim.

Given the general nature of the claim and the lack of specific context or data provided, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be to consider it as partially accurate but not fully substantiated.

Le chômage est à son plus haut niveau au Nigerai; Plus de 10 millions de jeunes sont sans emploi.,half true,fr,Unemployment is at its highest level in Nigeria; more than 10 million young people are without jobs.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Unemployment is at its highest level in Nigeria; more than 10 million young people are without jobs,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available on unemployment in Nigeria.

1. **Unemployment Rate**: According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Nigeria, the unemployment rate has indeed been high in recent years. For instance, the unemployment rate was reported to be around 33.3% in Q4 2020, which was one of the highest rates recorded.

2. **Youth Unemployment**: The youth unemployment rate (ages 15-34) has also been particularly high. Reports have indicated that youth unemployment and underemployment combined could affect more than 50% of the youth population.

3. **Number of Unemployed Youth**: Nigeria has a large youth population. If we consider that the youth population is substantial and the unemployment rate among them is high, it is plausible that the number of unemployed young people could exceed 10 million. For example, if the youth population is around 60 million and the unemployment rate is around 33%, that would result in approximately 20 million unemployed youth.

Given these points, the claim that ""Unemployment is at its highest level in Nigeria; more than 10 million young people are without jobs"" aligns closely with available data, though exact numbers can vary slightly depending on the source and the specific time frame.

« Kédougou est la région avec le taux de mortalité le plus élevé au Sénégal »,mostly true,fr,"""Kédougou is the region with the highest mortality rate in Senegal.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Kédougou is the region with the highest mortality rate in Senegal,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on mortality rates by region in Senegal. Mortality rates can be influenced by various factors including healthcare access, socioeconomic conditions, and public health initiatives.

As of my last update in 2023, Kédougou is known to be one of the less developed regions in Senegal, with significant challenges in healthcare access and infrastructure. However, without specific and up-to-date statistical data confirming that Kédougou has the highest mortality rate compared to other regions in Senegal, it is difficult to definitively verify this claim.

As of the latest available data, the number of Brazilians listed in the SPC has been reported to be around 63 million. This figure can fluctuate over time due to changes in economic conditions, debt repayment, and other factors.

Given that the claim states ""more than 63 million,"" and the most recent data aligns closely with this number, the claim can be considered accurate but slightly overstated.

"Caiu tudo [índices de criminalidade]. Caiu roubo, caiu latrocínio, caiu homicídios",half true,pt,"'Everything dropped [crime rates]. Robbery dropped, armed robbery dropped, homicides dropped.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Everything dropped [crime rates]. Robbery dropped, armed robbery dropped, homicides dropped,"" we need to examine crime statistics over a relevant period. Crime rates can fluctuate based on various factors, including changes in law enforcement practices, economic conditions, and social policies.

1. **Robbery Rates**: According to data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, robbery rates in the United States have generally been on a downward trend over the past few decades. However, there can be year-to-year variations.

2. **Armed Robbery Rates**: Armed robbery is a subset of robbery, and its trends typically follow the overall robbery rates. If robbery rates are decreasing, it is likely that armed robbery rates are also decreasing, though specific data on armed robbery alone may be less readily available.

3. **Homicide Rates**: Homicide rates have also generally decreased over the long term in the United States, though there have been periods of increase, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.

Given that crime rates can vary by location and over time, and considering the general trends in the data, the claim that ""everything dropped"" might be an overgeneralization. While many crime rates have indeed decreased, there are exceptions and fluctuations.

1. **Viktor Orbán's Request**: In March 2020, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was granted the ability to rule by decree indefinitely to manage the COVID-19 crisis, which effectively gave him ""full powers.""

2. **Swedish Prime Minister's Actions**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, who is a member of the Social Democrats (a socialist party), did seek temporary expanded powers to manage the crisis. However, these powers were more limited in scope and duration compared to those granted to Orbán. The Swedish government sought the ability to quickly implement measures without going through the usual legislative process, but this was subject to parliamentary oversight and was not indefinite.

Given these points, the claim that the Swedish Prime Minister asked for ""full powers"" in the same sense as Orbán is misleading. While both leaders sought expanded powers to handle the pandemic, the nature and extent of these powers were significantly different.

“[El turismo interno] del 2013 al 2015 cayó en tres millones de pasajeros”,true,es,"""[Domestic tourism] from 2013 to 2015 dropped by three million passengers.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that domestic tourism from 2013 to 2015 dropped by three million passengers, we would need to verify the actual data on domestic tourism for those years. This would involve checking reliable sources such as government tourism statistics, industry reports, or other authoritative data sources.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to approach this:

1. **Check Government Reports**: Look for tourism statistics published by the national tourism board or relevant government department.
2. **Industry Reports**: Review reports from tourism industry associations or market research firms.
3. **News Articles**: Search for news articles from reputable sources that might have reported on trends in domestic tourism during those years.

If the data confirms that there was indeed a drop of three million passengers in domestic tourism from 2013 to 2015, the claim would be 'True'. If the drop was close to three million but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the drop was significantly different, the claim could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Une loi défiscalise les investissements dans le tourisme en Casamance.,mostly true,fr,A law exempts investments in tourism in Casamance from taxes.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A law exempts investments in tourism in Casamance from taxes,"" we need to verify the existence and specifics of such a law. 

1. **Research the Legal Framework**: Check the legal texts and regulations in Senegal, particularly those related to investment incentives in the Casamance region.
2. **Consult Government Sources**: Look for official statements or documents from Senegalese government agencies, such as the Ministry of Tourism or the Ministry of Finance.
3. **Review Secondary Sources**: Analyze reports from reputable organizations or news outlets that cover economic policies in Senegal.

Without access to real-time data, I can provide a general approach based on typical investment incentive structures:

- **Investment Incentives**: Many countries offer tax exemptions or reductions to stimulate investment in specific sectors or regions. These incentives can include exemptions from corporate income tax, value-added tax (VAT), or import duties.
- **Regional Development Policies**: Casamance, being a region with unique economic and social challenges, might have special policies to attract investment, including in tourism.

Given the context, it is plausible that there could be some form of tax incentive for investments in tourism in Casamance. However, the claim that investments are entirely exempt from taxes might be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the actual policy, which could include partial exemptions or specific conditions.

**Conclusion**: Without specific legal texts or official confirmation, the claim cannot be fully verified. However, based on common practices, it is likely that there are some tax incentives for tourism investments in Casamance, but not necessarily a complete exemption.

Hoje o Brasil está com quase metade da renda per capita do Chile,half true,pt,"Today, Brazil has almost half the per capita income of Chile.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Today, Brazil has almost half the per capita income of Chile,"" we need to compare the per capita incomes of Brazil and Chile using recent data.

As of the latest available data:
- According to the World Bank, the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita for Brazil in 2021 was approximately $7,720 (using the Atlas method).
- For Chile, the GNI per capita in 2021 was approximately $15,000 (using the Atlas method).

To see if Brazil's per capita income is ""almost half"" of Chile's, we can perform a simple calculation:
- Half of Chile's per capita income ($15,000) is $7,500.
- Brazil's per capita income ($7,720) is slightly above $7,500, which is indeed close to half of Chile's per capita income.

Given this information, the claim that ""Brazil has almost half the per capita income of Chile"" is fairly accurate.

1. **Definition of ""Best""**: The term ""best"" is subjective and can vary based on criteria such as cost, coverage breadth, ease of access, and customer satisfaction.
2. **Comparison with Other Providers**: To assert that PAMI affiliates have the best coverage, we would need comprehensive data comparing PAMI's medication coverage with all other providers in America.
3. **Uniformity Across Affiliates**: The claim states ""all PAMI affiliates,"" implying uniformity in coverage quality across all affiliates, which may not be the case.

Given the subjective nature of ""best"" and the lack of specific comparative data, it is challenging to definitively prove this claim.

In other words: it is decreasing.","To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the accuracy of the deficit figures and the context in which they were presented.

1. **Deficit Figures**: 
   - The claim states that the deficit was R$279 billion when the government was taken over.
   - The following year, the deficit was R$159 billion.

2. **Context**:
   - The government referred to is likely the administration that took over in Brazil in 2016.
   - The deficit figures should be checked for the years 2016 and 2017.

**Verification**:
- According to official data, the primary deficit of the Brazilian government in 2016 was approximately R$159 billion.
- The total public sector deficit, which includes interest payments, was around R$562 billion in 2016.
- For 2017, the primary deficit was around R$124 billion, and the total public sector deficit was around R$511 billion.

Given these figures, the claim that the deficit was R$279 billion in 2016 is incorrect. The primary deficit was significantly lower, and even the total public sector deficit was much higher than R$279 billion. The claim that the deficit decreased to R$159 billion in 2017 is also incorrect based on the primary deficit figures.

**Conclusion**:
The claim contains inaccuracies regarding the specific deficit figures and their context. Therefore, the statement is not accurate.

1. **Population Reference**: The claim does not specify whether it refers to a specific country's population or the global population. This ambiguity makes it difficult to verify the claim accurately.

2. **Data Source**: The claim does not provide a source or reference for the 3% figure. Without a reliable source, it's challenging to assess the validity of the statement.

3. **Airline Market Share**: Aerolíneas could refer to Aerolíneas Argentinas, a major airline in Argentina. If the claim pertains to Argentina, we would need data on the market share of Aerolíneas Argentinas within the country. If it pertains to the global population, the claim is likely to be less accurate given the vast number of airlines worldwide.

1. **EITI Reports**: The EITI is a global standard for the good governance of oil, gas, and mineral resources. Countries that implement the EITI disclose information along the extractive industry value chain from the point of extraction, to how the revenue makes its way through the government, and its contribution to the economy.

2. **Global Rankings**: The EITI and other transparency indices often rank countries based on their adherence to transparency standards. These rankings can provide insight into how Senegal compares to other countries both in Africa and globally.

3. **Recent Data**: Checking the most recent EITI reports or other transparency indices will provide the latest rankings and assessments.

Based on the latest available data from the EITI and other transparency indices, Senegal has made significant progress in transparency in the extractive industries. However, it is important to verify the specific claim about being the leading African country and the 4th in the world.

As of the latest EITI reports and other transparency indices, Senegal is recognized for its efforts but is not necessarily ranked as the leading African country or the 4th in the world. Other African countries like Ghana and Nigeria also have strong transparency records. Globally, countries like Norway, the UK, and others often rank higher.

1. **Context**: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, former President of Brazil, was involved in legal proceedings and claimed that his prosecution was politically motivated. He took his case to the UN Human Rights Committee.

2. **UN Human Rights Committee**: In 2018, the UN Human Rights Committee did issue a statement regarding Lula's right to run in the presidential election, suggesting that his political rights should be preserved until all appeals were exhausted. However, this does not directly address the legitimacy of the plea based on the weakness of the accusations.

3. **Legitimacy of Plea**: The UN Human Rights Committee did not explicitly state that Lula's plea was legitimate due to the weakness of the accusations. Their focus was more on ensuring his political rights and fair trial standards.

Given this information, the claim that the UN said Lula's plea was legitimate due to the weakness of the accusation against him is not fully supported by the available evidence.

"[Após o rompimento da barragem em Brumadinho, o Ibama aplicou uma multa de R$ 250 milhões à Vale] Diferente do que aconteceu, por exemplo, em Mariana",half true,pt,"'[After the dam burst in Brumadinho, Ibama imposed a fine of R$ 250 million on Vale] Unlike what happened, for example, in Mariana'.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Whether Ibama (Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources) imposed a fine of R$ 250 million on Vale after the Brumadinho dam burst.
2. Whether a similar fine was imposed or not imposed after the Mariana dam disaster.

**Brumadinho Dam Burst:**
- The Brumadinho dam disaster occurred on January 25, 2019.
- Ibama did indeed impose a fine of R$ 250 million on Vale for the environmental damage caused by the Brumadinho dam burst.

**Mariana Dam Disaster:**
- The Mariana dam disaster occurred on November 5, 2015.
- After the Mariana disaster, Ibama imposed a fine of R$ 250 million on Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton.

Given this information, the claim that Ibama imposed a fine of R$ 250 million on Vale after the Brumadinho disaster is accurate. However, the statement that this did not happen in the case of Mariana is misleading because a similar fine was indeed imposed, albeit on Samarco, which involves Vale.

La Côte d'Ivoire est l'un des 20 pays pauvres ou émergents qui dépensenet le moins pour la santé des populations.,mostly true,fr,Côte d'Ivoire is one of the 20 poor or emerging countries that spend the least on the health of their populations.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Côte d'Ivoire is one of the 20 poor or emerging countries that spend the least on the health of their populations,"" we need to look at data on health expenditure by country, particularly focusing on low-income and emerging economies.

According to data from sources such as the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO), health expenditure as a percentage of GDP and per capita health expenditure can provide insights into how much a country invests in the health of its population.

Côte d'Ivoire is classified as a lower-middle-income country by the World Bank. Historically, it has had relatively low health expenditure compared to many other countries. For instance, in recent years, Côte d'Ivoire's health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been lower than the global average and lower than many other countries in similar economic categories.

However, to definitively place Côte d'Ivoire among the ""20 poor or emerging countries that spend the least on health,"" we would need a specific ranking or list that identifies the bottom 20 countries in terms of health expenditure. While Côte d'Ivoire is known for low health spending, without a precise and current ranking, it is challenging to confirm it is definitively in the bottom 20.

Given the available information and the general understanding of Côte d'Ivoire's health expenditure, the claim appears to be largely accurate but not definitively confirmed by a specific ranking.

“En la Justicia Federal las vacantes oscilan en el 30%”,mostly true,es,"""In the Federal Judiciary, vacancies hover around 30%.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In the Federal Judiciary, vacancies hover around 30%,"" we need to look at the actual data on federal judicial vacancies.

As of the most recent data available, the number of authorized federal judgeships and the number of vacancies can be found on the United States Courts website or through other reliable sources such as the Congressional Research Service. Historically, the percentage of vacancies in the federal judiciary has varied, but it has generally been much lower than 30%.

For example, as of early 2023, the vacancy rate in the federal judiciary was significantly lower than 30%. Typically, the vacancy rate has ranged from around 5% to 15% in recent years, depending on various factors such as the rate of judicial appointments and retirements.

Given this context, the claim that vacancies hover around 30% is not supported by the available data.

A quantidade de quilômetros desmatados [na Amazônia] no ano passado foi de 8 mil quilômetros quadrados,true,pt,The amount of deforested kilometers [in the Amazon] last year was 8 thousand square kilometers.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The amount of deforested kilometers [in the Amazon] last year was 8 thousand square kilometers,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available on Amazon deforestation.

According to data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE), which monitors deforestation in the Amazon, the deforestation rate can vary significantly from year to year. For instance, in 2021, the deforestation rate was reported to be around 13,235 square kilometers. In previous years, the figures have also fluctuated, but they have generally been higher than 8,000 square kilometers in recent years.

Given this context, the claim that the deforested area was 8 thousand square kilometers last year appears to be an understatement based on the most recent data.

"Sono stati drasticamente ridotti personale (20 mila dipendenti in meno) e risorse (5,2 miliardi in meno in quattro anni) [alle province], ma sono rimaste funzioni fondamentali come la pianificazione territoriale, le strade, l'edilizia scolastica, il trasporto pubblico e privato",mostly true,it,"Personnel (20,000 fewer employees) and resources (€5.2 billion less over four years) [to the provinces] have been drastically reduced, but essential functions such as territorial planning, roads, school buildings, and public and private transport remain.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. **Personnel Reduction**: The claim states that there are 20,000 fewer employees. We need to confirm if this number is accurate.
2. **Resource Reduction**: The claim mentions a reduction of €5.2 billion over four years. We need to verify if this figure is correct.
3. **Essential Functions**: The claim asserts that despite the reductions, essential functions such as territorial planning, roads, school buildings, and public and private transport remain. We need to check if these functions are indeed still being maintained.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the figures and statements are based on reliable data, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the structure of the claim and the typical nature of such reductions, it is plausible that the reductions in personnel and resources are significant, and essential functions are often maintained despite budget cuts.

La commission d'enquête parlementaire sur les 48 milliards F CFA a violé l'article 48 du règlement intérieur de l'Assemblée nationale.,true,fr,The parliamentary inquiry commission on the 48 billion CFA francs violated Article 48 of the National Assembly's internal regulations.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The parliamentary inquiry commission on the 48 billion CFA francs violated Article 48 of the National Assembly's internal regulations,"" we need to consider the specific content of Article 48 of the National Assembly's internal regulations and whether the actions of the parliamentary inquiry commission indeed contravened this article.

Without the specific text of Article 48 and detailed information on the actions of the parliamentary inquiry commission, it is not possible to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is being made in a context where such a violation is being formally alleged, it would suggest that there is some basis for the claim, though it may not be fully substantiated.

Given the lack of specific details and assuming the claim is being made in a context where there is some evidence or formal allegation, the most cautious and balanced assessment would be:

Inflation rates can vary significantly by country and economic conditions. Without access to the specific data for the relevant time and location, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim.

However, if we assume the context is a typical scenario in a country with moderate inflation, a 10% accumulated inflation over 10 months could be plausible. But this is speculative without concrete data.

As of the latest data, the city of São Paulo has a large number of students enrolled across its municipal, state, and private school systems. According to the São Paulo State Department of Education and other educational statistics, the combined total of students in these systems is indeed around 2.5 million.

1. **Existence of the Program**: ""Circulatura do Quadrado"" is indeed a program that airs on TVI24, a Portuguese news channel.
2. **Nature of the Program**: The program is known for discussing and debating various political and social issues.

Given that the program exists and its format involves debates, the claim that an issue was being debated on ""Circulatura do Quadrado"" on TVI24 is accurate.

1. The number of women in Parliament from each political force.
2. The number of graduates in Parliament from each political force.

Without specific data or context, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a credible source and there is no contradictory evidence, we might lean towards it being accurate.

Não houve parceria com o governo federal e estadual (para a realização da Rio 2016),false,pt,There was no partnership with the federal and state governments (for the realization of Rio 2016).,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""There was no partnership with the federal and state governments for the realization of Rio 2016,"" we need to consider the involvement of various levels of government in the planning and execution of the Rio 2016 Olympics.

The Rio 2016 Olympics involved significant collaboration between multiple levels of government, including the federal, state, and municipal governments. The Brazilian federal government, the state of Rio de Janeiro, and the city of Rio de Janeiro all played crucial roles in funding, infrastructure development, security, and overall organization of the event. The federal government provided substantial financial support and resources, while the state and city governments were responsible for local infrastructure and logistics.

Given this context, the claim that ""There was no partnership with the federal and state governments for the realization of Rio 2016"" is inaccurate.

“Van cuatro años que no hay paros [docentes] y justo aparece un paro dos días antes de la elección”,half true,es,"""It's been four years without [teacher] strikes, and now a strike appears just two days before the election.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. Whether there have indeed been no teacher strikes for the past four years.
2. Whether a teacher strike has appeared just two days before the election.

If both points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If one point is accurate but the other is not, the claim would be 'Half True'. If neither point is accurate, the claim would be 'False'. If the claim is mostly accurate but has minor inaccuracies, it would be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the nature of the inaccuracies.

Without specific data to verify these points, I can only provide a logical approach to the evaluation. Assuming the information provided is accurate:

- If there have been no teacher strikes for four years and a strike has indeed appeared two days before the election, the claim is 'True'.
- If there have been no teacher strikes for four years but the strike did not appear exactly two days before the election, the claim could be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True' depending on the timing.
- If there have been teacher strikes within the past four years, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False' depending on the frequency and timing of those strikes.

Given the lack of specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming the information is accurate:

Given the lack of specific details, we can only assess the general statement that a ""farce"" is being denounced. Since it is plausible that a social media post could be denouncing something perceived as a farce, the claim is not inherently false.

1. **""Privatize now""**: This is an opinion or a call to action, not a factual statement, so it cannot be evaluated for truthfulness.

2. **""This is a disgrace, a waste of public money""**: This is a subjective statement. Whether the Postal Service is a ""disgrace"" or a ""waste of public money"" depends on one's perspective and criteria for evaluation. Some may argue that the Postal Service is inefficient and loses money, while others may point to its essential services and argue that it provides value to the public.

3. **""Negligence by those responsible for the administration of the Postal Service""**: This is a serious accusation that would require specific evidence of negligence. Without concrete examples or evidence, this statement is speculative.

4. **""That's why this den of corruption and parasites must be privatized""**: The terms ""den of corruption and parasites"" are highly charged and pejorative. To claim corruption, there would need to be evidence of illegal or unethical behavior. The term ""parasites"" is a derogatory term that implies people are benefiting unfairly, which is a subjective judgment.

5. **""Must be privatized""**: Again, this is an opinion or a policy recommendation, not a factual statement.

Given that the claim is largely composed of opinions, subjective judgments, and unsubstantiated accusations, it cannot be evaluated as entirely true or false based on factual evidence alone. However, the lack of concrete evidence and the highly subjective nature of the statements lean towards a lack of verifiable truth.

1. **Definition of ""excess of public employees""**: This is subjective and depends on the context, such as the population of San Luis, the standard ratio of public employees to residents, and comparisons to similar regions.

2. **Verification of the number 17,000**: We need to confirm if the number of public employees in San Luis is indeed 17,000.

3. **Contextual benchmarks**: We should compare the number of public employees in San Luis to other regions with similar demographics and needs to determine if 17,000 is considered excessive.

Without specific data on the population of San Luis, the standard ratio of public employees to residents, and comparisons to similar regions, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the number 17,000 is accurate and without additional context, we can only partially assess the claim.

Given the lack of detailed information to fully verify or refute the claim, the most appropriate categorization would be:

2. **Incident Context**: The claim involves a specific incident where a student received a laptop from Ganjar Pranowo.
3. **Reason for the Gift**: The claim states that the student was watching pornographic videos, which is a critical detail that needs verification.

O presidente de 65 anos curado da Covid-19 com a cloroquina!,false,pt,The 65-year-old president cured of Covid-19 with chloroquine!,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The 65-year-old president cured of Covid-19 with chloroquine!"", we need to consider several factors:

1. **Efficacy of Chloroquine**: Chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine were initially considered potential treatments for COVID-19. However, subsequent studies and clinical trials have shown mixed results, and many health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have advised against its use for COVID-19 outside of clinical trials due to lack of proven efficacy and potential side effects.

2. **Individual Cases**: While some individuals, including high-profile figures, may have reported recovery from COVID-19 after taking chloroquine, this does not establish a causal relationship. Recovery could be due to a variety of factors, including the body's natural immune response, other treatments, or supportive care.

3. **Verification of the Claim**: The claim does not specify which 65-year-old president is being referred to, making it difficult to verify the specific circumstances of the case. Without concrete evidence or a detailed medical report, it is challenging to attribute the recovery solely to chloroquine.

Given the current scientific consensus and the lack of specific details in the claim, it is not accurate to state definitively that chloroquine cured a 65-year-old president of COVID-19.

Protezione umanitaria solo in Italia e Slovacchia? Di Maio sbaglia,false,it,'Humanitarian protection only in Italy and Slovakia?

Humanitarian protection is a form of international protection given to individuals who do not qualify as refugees but still need protection due to serious risks in their home countries. This type of protection is not exclusive to Italy and Slovakia. Many European countries, including Germany, France, and Sweden, have provisions for granting humanitarian protection or similar statuses to individuals in need.

Given this information, the claim that humanitarian protection is only available in Italy and Slovakia is incorrect.

1. **Joaquim Barbosa's Statement**: Did Joaquim Barbosa, who was a prominent figure in the Mensalão scandal as a Supreme Court Justice in Brazil, actually make this specific statement?
2. **Context of the Mensalão Scandal**: The Mensalão scandal involved a vote-buying scheme in the Brazilian government, primarily involving the Workers' Party (PT) and its allies. It did not directly involve Petrobras, which was implicated in a different scandal known as Operation Car Wash (Lava Jato).
3. **Petrobras Involvement**: The claim mentions Petrobras, but the Mensalão scandal was not directly related to Petrobras. This could indicate a mix-up between the two scandals.

Given these points, the claim appears to be conflating two separate scandals (Mensalão and Petrobras). Joaquim Barbosa's involvement was with the Mensalão scandal, and there is no widely known record of him making a statement about deputies not taking money from Petrobras in that context.

1. **Global and National Reports**: Various countries and international organizations regularly publish reports on investments in basic sanitation. For instance, the World Bank, UNICEF, and WHO often release data on sanitation investments and improvements.

2. **Government Budgets and Initiatives**: Many governments allocate funds for basic sanitation in their annual budgets. Additionally, there are often specific initiatives or programs aimed at improving sanitation infrastructure.

3. **Private Sector and NGOs**: Investments in basic sanitation can also come from private companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that work on water and sanitation projects.

Given the broad scope of the claim, it is highly unlikely that there has been absolutely no investment in basic sanitation globally since 2015. There are numerous documented instances of investments in various regions and by different entities.

Quanti sono i processi in arretrato in Italia?,mostly true,it,How many pending cases are there in Italy?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim about the number of pending cases in Italy, we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available from official sources such as the Italian Ministry of Justice or other reputable legal institutions.

As of the latest available data, Italy has been known to have a significant backlog of pending cases in its judicial system. For instance, reports from recent years have indicated that there are hundreds of thousands of pending cases in both civil and criminal courts. However, the exact number can fluctuate and may not be readily available without specific, up-to-date statistics.

Given that the claim is asking for a specific number of pending cases and without providing a concrete figure, it is challenging to verify its accuracy precisely. Therefore, the claim's truthfulness cannot be fully assessed without additional context or specific numbers.

Without this specific information, it is impossible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is being made in a context where the timing is accurately known and verified, we can proceed with the following logic:

- If the current time is indeed less than 24 hours before the scheduled discussion and vote, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the current time is more than 24 hours before the scheduled discussion and vote, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific timing information in the provided context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the context is accurate and the timing is correct:

Italia Paese di mamme?,half true,it,"Italy, a country of mothers?","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Italy, a country of mothers,"" we need to consider various factors such as cultural, social, and demographic aspects related to motherhood in Italy.

1. **Cultural Aspect**: Italy has a strong cultural emphasis on family values and motherhood. Italian society traditionally places a high value on the role of mothers within the family unit.

2. **Demographic Aspect**: Italy has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe. According to recent statistics, the fertility rate in Italy is around 1.3 children per woman, which is below the replacement level of 2.1. This suggests that while motherhood is culturally significant, fewer women are becoming mothers compared to other countries.

3. **Social Policies**: Italy has various social policies aimed at supporting mothers, such as maternity leave and child benefits. However, these policies are often criticized for not being as comprehensive or effective as those in some other European countries.

Given these points, the claim ""Italy, a country of mothers"" is somewhat nuanced. While motherhood is culturally significant, the low birth rate and criticisms of social policies suggest that the claim is not entirely accurate.

According to data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and other relevant health organizations, Rio Grande do Sul has consistently been reported as having one of the highest suicide rates in the country. However, it is important to distinguish between the highest number of suicides and the highest suicide rate. The highest number of suicides might be found in more populous states, while the highest rate (number of suicides per 100,000 people) could be in less populous states like Rio Grande do Sul.

Given that Rio Grande do Sul is often cited for having a high suicide rate but not necessarily the highest absolute number of suicides, the claim is somewhat misleading.

"[A gestão do PT deixou] um rombo orçamentário, em 2017, de R$ 7 bilhões",false,pt,'[The PT administration left] a budget deficit of R$ 7 billion in 2017'.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""[The PT administration left] a budget deficit of R$ 7 billion in 2017,"" we need to examine the context and the actual fiscal data from that period.

1. **Context**: The PT (Workers' Party) administration in Brazil was led by President Dilma Rousseff until her impeachment in August 2016. Michel Temer, from the PMDB (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party), took over the presidency after her impeachment and was in office throughout 2017.

2. **Fiscal Data**: According to official data from the Brazilian government and reports from the Central Bank of Brazil, the federal budget deficit for 2017 was significantly higher than R$ 7 billion. The primary deficit (which excludes interest payments on debt) was around R$ 124 billion, and the nominal deficit (which includes interest payments) was even higher.

3. **Responsibility**: While the PT administration did contribute to the fiscal situation through its policies and economic management, the specific deficit figure for 2017 cannot be solely attributed to the PT, as Michel Temer was the acting president for the entire year of 2017.

Given this information, the claim that the PT administration left a budget deficit of R$ 7 billion in 2017 is not accurate in terms of the actual deficit figure and the attribution of responsibility.

Porto Alegre teve um aumento no número de feminicídios,true,pt,Porto Alegre has seen an increase in the number of femicides.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Porto Alegre has seen an increase in the number of femicides,"" we would need to examine recent and reliable data from official sources such as government reports, law enforcement statistics, or reputable research studies on femicides in Porto Alegre.

If recent data shows a clear upward trend in the number of femicides in Porto Alegre, the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows a slight increase or if the increase is not consistent over time, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the data shows no significant change or a decrease, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without access to the specific data at this moment, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to verify it:

1. Check recent crime statistics from Porto Alegre's law enforcement agencies.
2. Look for reports or studies from reputable organizations that focus on gender-based violence in Brazil.
3. Review news articles from credible sources that discuss trends in femicides in Porto Alegre.

"Um vídeo de uma suposta eurodeputada alemã a criticar, em pleno Parla......",false,pt,"A video of an alleged German MEP criticizing, in the middle of the Parla......","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the existence of the video and the context in which the German MEP is speaking. This involves checking credible sources, such as news outlets, official records from the European Parliament, and statements from the MEP in question.

1. **Existence of the Video**: Confirm if there is a video showing a German MEP criticizing in the European Parliament.
2. **Context and Content**: Verify the content of the criticism and the context in which it was made. Was it indeed in the middle of a parliamentary session? What was the subject of the criticism?

Without specific details or access to the video and its context, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a real event that has been reported by multiple credible sources, we can make an educated guess.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim provided, I will base my response on the general reliability of such claims and the typical behavior of MEPs in the European Parliament.

1. Whether there was indeed a judicial order mandating the transfer of the PCC leadership, including Marcola, to federal prisons.
2. Whether Márcio França, who served as the Governor of São Paulo, disobeyed this judicial order.

If both conditions are met, the claim would be 'True'. If only one condition is met or if there are significant nuances, the rating would vary accordingly.

Based on available information:

1. There was a judicial order for the transfer of Marcola and other PCC leaders to federal prisons.
2. Márcio França, during his tenure as Governor of São Paulo, did not comply with this order, which led to criticism and legal challenges.

Given this context, the claim appears to be accurate.

O time da casa sempre passa da primeira fase,mostly true,pt,The home team always advances past the first stage.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The home team always advances past the first stage,"" we need to consider historical data from various tournaments where a home team is involved, such as the FIFA World Cup, the Olympics, and other major sports events.

For instance, in the FIFA World Cup, the home team has generally performed well and often advances past the group stage. However, there are exceptions. For example, South Africa, the host of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, did not advance past the group stage.

Given that there are documented instances where the home team did not advance past the first stage, the claim cannot be considered entirely true.

[O Brasil tem] 52 milhões [de pessoas] abaixo da linha da pobreza,true,pt,'[Brazil has] 52 million [people] below the poverty line'.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that Brazil has 52 million people below the poverty line, we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available on poverty in Brazil.

According to the World Bank and other reputable sources, the poverty line is often defined as living on less than $5.50 per day in upper-middle-income countries like Brazil. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and other organizations provide data on poverty rates in Brazil.

As of the latest available data, Brazil has a population of approximately 213 million people. Various reports and studies indicate that around 25% of the population lives below the poverty line, which would translate to roughly 53 million people. This figure can fluctuate based on economic conditions, policy changes, and other factors.

Given this context, the claim that Brazil has 52 million people below the poverty line is very close to the estimates provided by reputable sources.

If there are official and credible sources confirming the establishment of Military Police battalions in Araruama, Nova Iguaçu, and Itaguaí, then the claim would be 'True'. If there are partial confirmations or plans that are not fully detailed or confirmed, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If there is no evidence or the information is incorrect, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given that I do not have real-time access to current events or official announcements, I cannot verify this claim directly. However, if you have access to recent news or official statements, you can cross-check this information.

1. **Technological Safeguards Agreement (TSA)**: The TSA between the United States and Brazil was signed to protect U.S. technology in space launches from the Alcântara Launch Center. This agreement is crucial for allowing U.S. companies to use the launch site, as it ensures that sensitive technology is safeguarded.

2. **Alcântara Launch Center**: Located in Brazil, the Alcântara Launch Center is considered a strategic site for satellite launches due to its proximity to the equator, which allows for more efficient launches.

3. **Feasibility**: The TSA is a significant step towards making the Alcântara Launch Center operational for international launches, particularly those involving U.S. technology. However, while the TSA is a critical component, it is not the only factor in making the launch center feasible. Other aspects such as infrastructure, investment, and regulatory frameworks also play essential roles.

Given this context, the claim that the TSA ""will make the Alcântara Launch Center feasible"" is somewhat overstated. The TSA is indeed a major milestone, but it alone does not make the launch center fully feasible without considering other necessary components.

1. **Historical Context**: The COVID-19 pandemic led to various public health measures worldwide, including the closure of public spaces to prevent the spread of the virus.
2. **Local Measures**: In Porto Alegre, like many other cities, local authorities implemented restrictions and closures of public spaces, including markets, to comply with health guidelines.
3. **Specific Event**: The Public Market of Porto Alegre, a significant landmark and commercial hub, was indeed closed temporarily during the pandemic as part of these measures.

Given this context, the claim that the Public Market of Porto Alegre was closed during the pandemic is accurate.

Não tem uma lei de combate à corrupção que não tenha sido aprovada no governo do PT.,half true,pt,There is no anti-corruption law that was not approved during the PT government.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There is no anti-corruption law that was not approved during the PT government,"" we need to examine the legislative history of anti-corruption laws in Brazil and the timeline of the PT (Partido dos Trabalhadores) government's tenure.

The PT government in Brazil was in power from 2003 to 2016, under the presidencies of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff. During this period, several significant anti-corruption measures were indeed enacted, such as:

1. The Clean Company Act (Lei da Empresa Limpa) in 2013, which holds companies accountable for corrupt practices.
2. The Access to Information Law (Lei de Acesso à Informação) in 2011, which increased transparency in government operations.
3. The creation of the Office of the Comptroller General (Controladoria-Geral da União) in 2003, which plays a key role in combating corruption.

However, it is important to note that anti-corruption efforts and legislation did not start or end with the PT government. For example:

1. The Law of Administrative Improbity (Lei de Improbidade Administrativa) was enacted in 1992, before the PT government.
2. The Anti-Corruption Law (Lei Anticorrupção) of 2013 was indeed during the PT government, but subsequent governments have also enacted or amended anti-corruption laws.

Given this context, the claim that ""There is no anti-corruption law that was not approved during the PT government"" is an overstatement. While the PT government did approve several important anti-corruption laws, it is not accurate to say that all anti-corruption laws were approved during their tenure.

"Compramos 35 mil coletes à prova de balas, os melhores coletes disponíveis no mundo, leilão internacional",false,pt,"We bought 35,000 bulletproof vests, the best vests available in the world, through an international auction.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. The purchase of 35,000 bulletproof vests.
2. The assertion that these are the best vests available in the world.
3. The method of acquisition being through an international auction.

Without specific details or evidence to confirm these points, such as official procurement records, expert evaluations of the vests' quality, and documentation of the auction process, it is challenging to fully validate the claim. However, we can analyze the plausibility based on general knowledge and typical procurement practices.

1. **Quantity**: Large-scale purchases of equipment like bulletproof vests are not uncommon for military or law enforcement agencies.
2. **Quality**: The term ""best vests available in the world"" is subjective and can vary based on criteria like protection level, comfort, and durability. Independent testing and certification (e.g., by the National Institute of Justice in the U.S.) would be needed to substantiate this claim.
3. **Auction**: International auctions are a possible method for acquiring such equipment, though direct contracts with manufacturers are more common.

Given the lack of specific evidence to confirm or refute each part of the claim, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
O Brasil já tem 100 milhões de processos [na Justiça],half true,pt,Brazil already has 100 million cases [in the Judiciary].,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Brazil already has 100 million cases [in the Judiciary],"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available regarding the number of cases in the Brazilian judiciary system.

According to the National Council of Justice (CNJ) in Brazil, the judiciary system has indeed been dealing with a very high number of cases. As of recent reports, the number of cases in the Brazilian judiciary system has been cited to be around 80 to 100 million. This includes both pending and new cases across various levels of the judiciary.

Given this information, the claim that Brazil has 100 million cases in the judiciary is within the range of reported figures, though it might be on the higher end of the spectrum.

The phrase ""Great Educator of the Working Class"" is often associated with Vladimir Lenin, a key figure in the Russian Revolution and the leader of the Bolshevik Party.

Italiani in Germania: nessuna circolare con minacce di espulsione,false,it,Italians in Germany: no circular with threats of expulsion.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Italians in Germany: no circular with threats of expulsion,"" we need to verify whether there has been any official circular or document issued by German authorities that threatens Italians with expulsion.

1. **Research and Verification**: 
   - Check official German government sources, such as the Federal Ministry of the Interior, for any announcements or circulars regarding the expulsion of Italians.
   - Look for news reports or statements from credible news agencies and Italian diplomatic sources in Germany.
   - Verify with European Union regulations, as both Germany and Italy are EU member states, and EU citizens have the right to live and work in any member country.

2. **Contextual Understanding**:
   - EU citizens, including Italians, generally have the right to reside in other EU countries without the threat of expulsion unless they pose a serious threat to public policy, security, or health.
   - Any circular threatening expulsion would be highly unusual and likely to attract significant media attention and diplomatic responses.

3. **Current Information**:
   - As of the latest available information, there have been no credible reports or official documents indicating that Germany has issued a circular threatening Italians with expulsion.

Based on the above steps, there is no evidence to support the claim that there is a circular with threats of expulsion for Italians in Germany.

NARCOTRÁFICO & COMUNISMO. Em 2015 eu postei esta foto que foi retirada pelo Facebook que disse que a foto estava denegrindo a imagem da Presidente Dilma.

Today, with Palocci's plea bargain confirming the connections between drug trafficking and the financing of communist politicians' campaigns, I am reposting the SAID PHOTO that was CENSORED in 2015. Will I be censored by communist censorship with proof?'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into several components:

1. **Photo Removal by Facebook in 2015**: The claim states that a photo was removed by Facebook in 2015 for allegedly tarnishing the image of President Dilma Rousseff. Facebook does have policies against content that it deems to violate its community standards, which can include defamation or misinformation. However, without specific evidence or confirmation from Facebook, it's difficult to verify this part of the claim.

2. **Palocci's Plea Bargain**: Antonio Palocci, a former Brazilian finance minister, did enter into a plea bargain in which he made various allegations about corruption and illicit activities involving politicians. However, the specific claim that he confirmed connections between drug trafficking and the financing of communist politicians' campaigns would need to be substantiated by credible sources or legal documents.

3. **Reposting the Photo and Censorship**: The claim suggests that reposting the photo might lead to censorship again. This is speculative and cannot be confirmed without knowing the content of the photo and Facebook's current policies.

Given the lack of concrete evidence for several parts of the claim, particularly the specific allegations about drug trafficking and campaign financing, and the speculative nature of future censorship, the overall claim lacks sufficient substantiation.

Final Answer: 'False'.",,False,True
A fêmea põe 400 ovos,false,pt,The female lays 400 eggs.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The female lays 400 eggs,"" we need more context about the species being referred to. Different species have varying reproductive behaviors and egg-laying capacities. For example:

- A female common frog can lay up to 4,000 eggs.
- A female monarch butterfly can lay around 300-400 eggs.
- A female chicken typically lays one egg per day, not reaching 400 eggs in a single laying period.

Given the lack of specific context, the claim could be accurate for certain species but not for others. Therefore, without additional information, the claim is somewhat ambiguous.

"Bolsonaro dispara nas pesquisas, 94% querem que ele seja reeleito em 2022",false,pt,"'Bolsonaro surges in the polls, 94% want him to be re-elected in 2022.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Bolsonaro surges in the polls, 94% want him to be re-elected in 2022,"" we need to consider the context and available data from credible sources.

1. **Poll Data**: Polling data from various reputable sources such as Datafolha, Ibope, and other recognized polling organizations should be reviewed. Historically, no credible poll has shown such an overwhelming percentage (94%) in favor of Bolsonaro's re-election.

2. **Historical Context**: Throughout Bolsonaro's presidency, his approval ratings have fluctuated significantly. While he has had periods of strong support, it has never reached such an extreme level as 94%.

3. **Credibility of the Source**: The claim should be verified against reliable news outlets and polling organizations. If the claim originates from a dubious or biased source, it is less likely to be accurate.

Given the above considerations, the claim that ""94% want him to be re-elected in 2022"" is highly unlikely to be true based on historical polling data and the general trends observed during Bolsonaro's presidency.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
Salvini ha ragione sui numeri degli sbarchi,true,it,Salvini is right about the numbers of landings.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Salvini is right about the numbers of landings,"" we need to consider the context and the specific numbers referenced by Matteo Salvini, an Italian politician known for his strong stance on immigration. Salvini has often cited statistics on the number of migrant landings in Italy to support his political arguments.

1. **Contextual Verification**: Salvini's statements about landings typically refer to the number of migrants arriving by sea, often from North Africa to Italy. These numbers can fluctuate based on various factors, including political agreements, weather conditions, and enforcement measures.

2. **Data Sources**: Reliable sources for verifying these numbers include official Italian government statistics, reports from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

3. **Recent Trends**: If Salvini's claim is recent, it would be important to compare his numbers with the latest available data. For example, if he claims a significant increase or decrease in landings, we should check if this aligns with the reported figures from these authoritative sources.

Without specific numbers or a direct quote from Salvini, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that Salvini's numbers are generally based on official statistics, we can make an educated assessment.

**Hypothetical Example**:
- If Salvini claimed that there were 10,000 landings in a particular month and official data shows a similar figure, his claim would be accurate.
- If there is a significant discrepancy between his numbers and the official data, the claim would be less accurate.

Given the need for precise data to make a definitive judgment, and assuming Salvini's numbers are generally aligned with official statistics but may sometimes be exaggerated for political purposes, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Malta: più presenze italiane che tedesche,true,it,Malta: more Italian visitors than German visitors.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Malta: more Italian visitors than German visitors,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable tourism statistics for Malta. These statistics are typically provided by national tourism boards or statistical agencies.

As of the latest available data, Italy and Germany are both significant sources of tourists to Malta. Historically, Italy has often been one of the top countries of origin for tourists visiting Malta, frequently surpassing Germany in visitor numbers. However, the exact ranking can vary year by year based on various factors such as economic conditions, travel trends, and airline routes.

For instance, in recent years, data from the National Statistics Office of Malta has shown that Italian visitors often outnumber German visitors. This trend is consistent with the geographical proximity and cultural ties between Malta and Italy.

Given this context, the claim ""Malta: more Italian visitors than German visitors"" aligns with the general trend observed in recent tourism statistics.

Apenas 30% dos que chegam ao 9º ano conseguem ler e interpretar um texto,half true,pt,Only 30% of those who reach the 9th grade are able to read and interpret a text.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Only 30% of those who reach the 9th grade are able to read and interpret a text,"" we need to consider the context and available data on literacy rates and educational outcomes. 

Literacy rates and the ability to read and interpret texts can vary significantly by country, region, and educational system. In many developed countries, the literacy rate among 9th graders is typically much higher than 30%. However, in some developing countries or regions with significant educational challenges, the literacy rate might be lower.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given that 30% is an unusually low figure for literacy among 9th graders in most contexts, it is likely that the claim is an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual situation.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Publicações no Facebook e mensagens no WhatsApp deixam o alerta: caso......,false,pt,Facebook posts and WhatsApp messages issue a warning: in case......,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Facebook posts and WhatsApp messages issue a warning: in case......,"" we need more context about the specific warning being referred to. However, based on the general nature of such claims, it is important to note that:

1. Facebook and WhatsApp are platforms where users can share information, including warnings.
2. The accuracy of the information shared on these platforms can vary widely.
3. Official warnings from Facebook or WhatsApp would typically come through official channels, not user-generated posts or messages.

Given the lack of specific context and the general nature of user-generated content on these platforms, the claim that ""Facebook posts and WhatsApp messages issue a warning"" is often misleading unless it is verified through official sources.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Segundo os institutos de pesquisa, 90% dos evangélicos do Rio de Janeiro no segundo turno votaram conosco",false,pt,"According to research institutes, 90% of evangelicals in Rio de Janeiro voted with us in the second round.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""90% of evangelicals in Rio de Janeiro voted with us in the second round,"" we need to consider the available data from research institutes and electoral studies.

1. **Research Data**: Check if there are credible research institutes that have conducted exit polls or surveys specifically targeting the voting behavior of evangelicals in Rio de Janeiro during the second round of the election.
2. **Election Results**: Compare the claim with the overall voting patterns and results in Rio de Janeiro to see if they align with the stated percentage.
3. **Contextual Factors**: Consider any contextual factors that might influence the voting behavior of evangelicals, such as political endorsements, campaign strategies, and socio-political climate.

Without specific data from credible sources, it is challenging to verify the exact percentage. However, if there is some evidence suggesting a high percentage but not necessarily 90%, the claim might be rated as 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If there is no supporting evidence or if the percentage is significantly lower, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the question, we cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the need for more concrete evidence:

"(...) O número de casos de HIV sobe, e o número de [casos de] Aids cai",true,pt,"The number of HIV cases is rising, and the number of AIDS cases is falling.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The number of HIV cases is rising, and the number of AIDS cases is falling,"" we need to consider recent trends and data from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

1. **HIV Cases Rising**: In some regions, particularly in certain demographics or areas with less access to preventive measures and healthcare, the number of new HIV infections may be increasing. However, globally, the overall trend has been a decline in new HIV infections due to better awareness, prevention strategies, and treatments.

2. **AIDS Cases Falling**: With the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV are less likely to progress to AIDS. This has led to a decrease in the number of AIDS cases, as more individuals are able to manage their HIV infection and maintain a higher quality of life without developing AIDS.

Given these points, the claim can be seen as somewhat accurate but not universally true across all regions and populations. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
“Desde hace 50 o 60 años que no había nuevas formaciones en la República Argentina”,false,es,"""For the past 50 or 60 years, there have been no new formations in the Argentine Republic.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""For the past 50 or 60 years, there have been no new formations in the Argentine Republic,"" we need to consider what is meant by ""formations."" This term could refer to various contexts such as geological formations, military formations, political formations, or even social and cultural formations.

1. **Geological Formations**: Geological formations are natural occurrences and are not typically subject to human timelines. New geological formations can occur over millions of years, so it would be inaccurate to claim that no new geological formations have occurred in the past 50 or 60 years.

2. **Military Formations**: If the claim refers to military formations, it would be necessary to look at the history of the Argentine military. Argentina has seen various changes and reorganizations in its military structure over the past several decades, including the creation of new units and divisions.

3. **Political Formations**: Politically, Argentina has experienced significant changes, including the formation of new political parties and movements. For example, the Justicialist Party (Peronist Party) has seen various offshoots and new political entities forming over the years.

4. **Social and Cultural Formations**: Social and cultural formations are constantly evolving. Argentina has seen new social movements, cultural groups, and organizations emerge over the past several decades.

Given the broad range of possible interpretations and the evidence that new formations have indeed occurred in various contexts within Argentina over the past 50 or 60 years, the claim does not hold up under scrutiny.

Não temos piso [salarial] da segurança pública,true,pt,We do not have a [salary] floor for public security.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We do not have a [salary] floor for public security,"" we need to consider the context and the specific policies in place regarding salaries for public security personnel.

1. **Definition of Salary Floor**: A salary floor is the minimum salary that must be paid to employees in a particular sector or job category.

2. **Public Security Sector**: This typically includes police officers, firefighters, and other emergency responders.

3. **Jurisdictional Variance**: Salary floors can vary by country, state, or municipality. Some regions may have established minimum salaries for public security personnel, while others may not.

4. **Research and Evidence**:
   - In some countries, there are national or regional laws that set minimum salaries for public security personnel.
   - In other regions, salaries may be determined by collective bargaining agreements or local government policies, which may or may not include a defined salary floor.

Given the variability and the need for specific context, the claim could be true in some areas and false in others. However, without specific context or jurisdiction, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

**General Conclusion**:
- If the claim is made in a context where there is no established minimum salary for public security personnel, it would be true.
- If the claim is made in a context where there is an established minimum salary, it would be false.

**Without specific context**, the most balanced assessment would be:

"Só com operações compromissadas, [o governo federal] lançou mão de R$ 1,114 trilhão, 16,8% do PIB",mostly true,pt,"'With repurchase agreements alone, [the federal government] utilized R$ 1.114 trillion, 16.8% of the GDP.'","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The total amount utilized by the federal government in repurchase agreements.
2. The percentage of GDP that this amount represents.

The claim states that the federal government utilized R$ 1.114 trillion in repurchase agreements, which is 16.8% of the GDP.

First, let's break down the components:

- **Repurchase Agreements (Repos):** These are short-term borrowing instruments where the government sells securities and agrees to repurchase them at a later date.
- **R$ 1.114 trillion:** This is the amount claimed to be utilized in repurchase agreements.
- **16.8% of GDP:** This is the percentage of the GDP that the R$ 1.114 trillion is claimed to represent.

To verify this, we need the following data:
- The total GDP of the country in the relevant year.
- The actual amount utilized in repurchase agreements by the federal government.

Assuming the GDP of the country is approximately R$ 6.63 trillion (since 16.8% of R$ 6.63 trillion is approximately R$ 1.114 trillion), we need to check if this aligns with the actual data.

If the actual GDP and the amount utilized in repurchase agreements match the figures provided, the claim would be accurate. If there are discrepancies, the claim's accuracy would be affected.

Without specific data to confirm or refute the exact figures, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim. Given that the numbers provided seem to align mathematically (16.8% of R$ 6.63 trillion is indeed R$ 1.114 trillion), the claim appears logically consistent.

"oggi c’è un’Italia […] dove il debito ha smesso di crescere, ci sono un milione di occupati in più, la fiducia di imprese e famiglie è molto più solida",true,it,"Today there is an Italy where the debt has stopped growing, there are a million more employed people, and the confidence of businesses and families is much stronger.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate each part of the statement:

1. **Debt has stopped growing**: This requires checking the latest data on Italy's national debt. If the debt has indeed stabilized or decreased recently, this part of the claim could be true. However, if the debt is still increasing, this part would be false.

2. **A million more employed people**: This can be verified by looking at employment statistics over a specific period. If there has been an increase of a million employed people within a reasonable timeframe, this part of the claim would be true.

3. **Confidence of businesses and families is much stronger**: This is more subjective but can be assessed through business and consumer confidence indices. If these indices show a significant increase, this part of the claim could be considered true.

Without the specific data to verify these points, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent improvements in Italy's economic indicators, it might lean towards being 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. 

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as 'Half True' unless all parts can be verified as accurate.

"«Un tema, quello della #regolarizzazione e del superamento della #Bossi-Fini che era nell’accordo di governo, nel segno della discontinuità con il #ConteI»",half true,it,"""A topic, that of regularization and the overcoming of the Bossi-Fini law, which was in the government agreement, in the spirit of discontinuity with Conte I.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the context and content of the statement. The Bossi-Fini law is an Italian immigration law that was enacted in 2002, which tightened regulations on immigration and made it more difficult for undocumented immigrants to regularize their status.

The claim suggests that the topic of regularization and overcoming the Bossi-Fini law was included in the government agreement and was intended to mark a discontinuity with the first Conte government (Conte I).

1. **Government Agreement**: The second Conte government (Conte II) was formed in September 2019, consisting of a coalition between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the Democratic Party (PD). This coalition aimed to address various issues, including immigration policies.

2. **Discontinuity with Conte I**: The first Conte government (Conte I) was a coalition between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League (Lega), which had a more stringent stance on immigration, influenced by the League's leader, Matteo Salvini.

3. **Regularization and Bossi-Fini Law**: The Conte II government did indeed discuss and implement measures to regularize the status of undocumented immigrants, which can be seen as a move away from the stricter policies of Conte I.

Given this context, the claim that the topic of regularization and overcoming the Bossi-Fini law was part of the government agreement and represented a shift from Conte I is supported by the available information.

"“Del total de jóvenes que no estudian ni trabajan en la Provincia de Buenos Aires, el 75% son mujeres”",true,es,"""Of the total number of young people who neither study nor work in the Province of Buenos Aires, 75% are women.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Of the total number of young people who neither study nor work in the Province of Buenos Aires, 75% are women,"" we would need to consult reliable and up-to-date statistical data from sources such as government reports, labor force surveys, or reputable research studies specific to the Province of Buenos Aires.

Without access to the specific data, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general trends and available information, it is known that women often face higher rates of unemployment and are more likely to be out of the labor force due to various socio-economic factors, including caregiving responsibilities and gender discrimination. This could potentially support the claim, but it is not sufficient to confirm it as accurate without concrete data.

Given the lack of specific data to either confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate response would be to acknowledge the uncertainty.

L’epidemia di Covid-19 ha peggiorato le già cattive condizioni lavorative dei giovani in Italia,true,it,The Covid-19 epidemic has worsened the already poor working conditions of young people in Italy.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Covid-19 epidemic has worsened the already poor working conditions of young people in Italy,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Pre-existing Conditions**: Before the Covid-19 pandemic, young people in Italy already faced significant challenges in the labor market, including high unemployment rates, precarious employment, and limited opportunities for stable, well-paying jobs.

2. **Impact of Covid-19**: The pandemic has had a profound impact on economies worldwide, and Italy was one of the hardest-hit countries. The lockdowns, restrictions, and economic downturn caused by the pandemic have exacerbated existing issues in the labor market. Young people, often employed in sectors like hospitality, retail, and tourism, were particularly vulnerable to job losses and reduced working hours.

3. **Data and Reports**: Various reports and studies have indicated that the pandemic has indeed worsened the employment situation for young people in Italy. For example, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and other labor market analyses have highlighted increased unemployment rates and deteriorating working conditions for young workers during the pandemic.

Given this context, the claim appears to be well-supported by evidence.

"«Sono per rendere legale l'eutanasia, come c’è in molti Paesi»",half true,it,"""I am in favor of making euthanasia legal, as it is in many countries.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I am in favor of making euthanasia legal, as it is in many countries,"" we need to evaluate the current legal status of euthanasia around the world.

Euthanasia is legal in a limited number of countries. As of now, countries where euthanasia is legal include Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Spain. Additionally, some jurisdictions within countries, such as certain states in Australia, have legalized euthanasia. However, the number of countries where euthanasia is legal is relatively small compared to the total number of countries in the world.

Given this context, the claim that euthanasia is legal ""in many countries"" is somewhat exaggerated. While it is legal in several countries, it is not accurate to say it is legal in ""many"" countries when considering the global context.

2. **Content of the Video**: Assess what the video actually shows and whether it aligns with the claim.
3. **Context and Credibility**: Evaluate the context in which the video is presented and the credibility of the source.

Without specific details about the video's content and context, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the information provided, we can make a preliminary assessment.

"No, lo stipendio di Salvini non è pagato solo dagli italiani",false,it,"No, Salvini's salary is not paid only by Italians.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""No, Salvini's salary is not paid only by Italians,"" we need to consider the sources of funding for the salary of Matteo Salvini, who is an Italian politician.

1. **Italian Government Salary**: If Salvini is serving in a capacity funded by the Italian government, such as a member of the Italian Parliament or a minister, his salary would primarily come from the Italian state budget. This budget is funded by Italian taxpayers.

2. **European Parliament Salary**: If Salvini is serving as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), his salary would come from the European Union budget. The EU budget is funded by contributions from all member states, including Italy. Therefore, his salary would be paid by taxpayers from all EU member states, not just Italians.

3. **Other Sources**: If Salvini receives income from other sources, such as private sector engagements, speaking fees, or book royalties, these would not be funded by Italian taxpayers.

Given these points, if Salvini's salary is derived from his role in the European Parliament or other EU-funded positions, it is accurate to say that his salary is not paid only by Italians. However, if his salary is from a position funded solely by the Italian government, then it would be primarily paid by Italians.

Considering the potential for multiple sources of income and the specific context of his roles, the claim ""No, Salvini's salary is not paid only by Italians"" is nuanced.

(image)","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""in Brasília alone, there are 40,000 registered fishermen receiving fishing aid,"" we need to verify the number of registered fishermen in Brasília and whether they receive fishing aid.

1. **Registered Fishermen in Brasília**: Brasília is a landlocked city, and while it has some water bodies, it is not known for having a large number of professional fishermen. The number 40,000 seems unusually high for a city like Brasília.

2. **Fishing Aid**: Fishing aid is typically provided to fishermen in coastal or riverine areas where fishing is a significant part of the local economy. Brasília does not fit this profile.

Given these points, the claim appears highly unlikely.

João Doria, a Brazilian politician and former governor of São Paulo, was involved in a controversy in 2017 when he was the mayor of São Paulo. The controversy stemmed from a promotional video for Brazilian tourism that featured women in bikinis on the beach, which many critics argued was inappropriate and promoted a negative image of Brazil, potentially encouraging sex tourism.

Given this context, the claim that Doria was ""violently criticized for an advertisement promoting Brazilian tourism with women's butts on the beach, clearly encouraging sex tourism"" aligns with the events that took place.

1. The timeframe mentioned (four years).
2. The number of new prison spaces built (3,000).
3. The involvement of the person making the claim in the construction of these prison spaces.

If the evidence supports that exactly 3,000 new prison spaces were built within the specified four years and the person making the claim was directly responsible for this construction, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies, such as the number being slightly less or more, or if the timeframe is slightly off, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the number is significantly different or the timeframe is incorrect, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific evidence to verify these details, we cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made in good faith and there is no reason to doubt it, we might lean towards 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

1. **Source of Data**: Identify reliable sources such as government reports, scientific studies, or reputable environmental organizations that track illegal deforestation rates.
2. **Time Frame**: Confirm that the data covers the period from 2012 to the present.
3. **Percentage Increase**: Check if the data supports an increase of approximately 37%.

Without access to specific data or sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to how one might verify it:

1. **Consult Reputable Sources**: Look at reports from organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Resources Institute (WRI), or national environmental agencies.
2. **Compare Data**: Examine deforestation rates from 2012 and compare them to the most recent data available.
3. **Calculate Increase**: Determine if the increase is indeed around 37%.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to the relevant data and it confirms the 37% increase, then the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows a different figure, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly.

The average retirement benefit can fluctuate based on various factors such as changes in policy, economic conditions, and demographic shifts.

As of the latest available data, the average retirement benefit from INSS has been reported to be around R$ 1,900. However, this figure can vary slightly depending on the source and the specific time period of the data.

Given that the claim is close to the reported average but may not be exact due to potential minor variations, the most appropriate classification would be:

"A retirada do ""uso emergencial"" pela FDA amplia o tratamento com hidroxicloroquina nos EUA",false,pt,"The removal of ""emergency use"" by the FDA expands the treatment with hydroxychloroquine in the USA.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the context and the FDA's actions regarding hydroxychloroquine.

1. **Emergency Use Authorization (EUA):** The FDA initially issued an EUA for hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 in March 2020. This allowed the drug to be used in certain hospitalized patients when clinical trials were not available.

2. **Revocation of EUA:** In June 2020, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine, citing that it was unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 and that its potential benefits did not outweigh the known and potential risks.

3. **Impact of Revocation:** The revocation of the EUA does not mean that hydroxychloroquine is banned or that it cannot be prescribed. It means that the drug is no longer authorized for emergency use specifically for COVID-19 treatment. Physicians can still prescribe it off-label, but it is not endorsed by the FDA for COVID-19 treatment.

Given this context, the claim that the removal of ""emergency use"" by the FDA expands the treatment with hydroxychloroquine is misleading. The revocation of the EUA actually restricts its use for COVID-19 under the emergency framework, although it can still be prescribed off-label.

State deputies in Brazil typically receive funds for various purposes, including office maintenance, staff salaries, and other expenses related to their mandate. However, the exact amount can vary significantly depending on the state and specific regulations in place. 

Without specific information about the state in question and the exact nature of the funds being referred to, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, R$ 40,000 could be a plausible figure for certain types of expenses or allocations, but it is not a standardized amount across all states.

1. **Definition of a Meme**: A meme is typically a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied and spread rapidly by internet users, often with slight variations.

2. **Current Trends**: Memes are a common and frequent occurrence on social media platforms. They often reflect current events, trends, or popular culture.

3. **Verification**: Without specific details about the meme or the current event it references, it's challenging to verify the exact claim. However, the general statement that a new meme is spreading on social media is plausible given the nature of social media dynamics.

1. **Government Allocation**: The claim states that the government has set aside 2 billion euros to cover a larger deficit. This part of the claim can be verified by checking official government announcements or budget documents.

2. **Impact on Cuts**: The claim suggests that this allocation will result in 2 billion euros in cuts to businesses, transportation, and universities. This implies a direct correlation between the allocation for the deficit and cuts in these specific sectors. This part of the claim would require evidence from government plans or budgetary adjustments indicating that these sectors will indeed face cuts.

3. **Timing and Review**: The claim mentions that these cuts will start next July when the Commission will conduct a review of Italian public finances. This part can be verified by checking the schedule of the European Commission's reviews and any related government plans.

Without specific evidence or official statements confirming each of these points, it is challenging to fully validate the claim. However, if we assume that the government has indeed set aside 2 billion euros for the deficit, the assertion that this will lead to equivalent cuts in specific sectors is speculative without concrete evidence.

1. **Needle covered with the protector at the end of the procedure**: This can vary depending on the medical procedure and the protocol followed. In some cases, needles are immediately covered with a protector for safety reasons, while in others, they may not be.

2. **Presence of cotton**: The use of cotton after a procedure is common but not universal. Some procedures may use alternative methods for managing any bleeding or cleaning the site.

3. **Accusation of a farce from the 'pink dictator'**: This is a subjective statement and seems to be an opinion rather than a factual claim. It implies distrust in the procedure or the person overseeing it, but it does not provide concrete evidence.

1. **Caring about the death of a child due to a stray bullet**: This part of the claim suggests that people on the political left express concern over the death of children who are victims of gun violence. This is generally true, as many left-leaning individuals and groups advocate for stricter gun control laws to prevent such tragedies.

2. **Promoting abortion tea**: This part of the claim is more complex. The term ""abortion tea"" is not a standard term in political discourse. It might be a derogatory or hyperbolic way to refer to the left's support for reproductive rights, including access to safe and legal abortion. The left generally supports a woman's right to choose, but this support is typically for medically supervised procedures rather than promoting any specific method like ""abortion tea.""

The claim attempts to highlight a perceived inconsistency or hypocrisy by juxtaposing concern for children killed by gun violence with support for abortion rights. However, these are separate issues with different contexts and ethical considerations. The left's stance on gun violence is about preventing unnecessary deaths through regulation, while their stance on abortion is about protecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body.

For instance, if the statement refers to a specific peace proposal, economic offer, or policy change that is well-known and documented to have occurred after 1995 and involved a 100% offer, then the claim could be evaluated as 'True' or 'Mostly True.' Conversely, if no such proposal is known or the details do not match, the claim could be 'False' or 'Mostly False.'

Given the lack of specific context, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, the most accurate response based on the available information is:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"“Vitória, uma capital do tamanho de Natal”",false,pt,"""Vitória, a capital the size of Natal.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Vitória, a capital the size of Natal,"" we need to compare the sizes of Vitória and Natal in terms of population and area.

1. **Population:**
   - Vitória is the capital of the state of Espírito Santo in Brazil. According to the latest available data, Vitória has a population of approximately 365,000 people.
   - Natal is the capital of the state of Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil. According to the latest available data, Natal has a population of approximately 890,000 people.

2. **Area:**
   - Vitória has an area of about 93 square kilometers.
   - Natal has an area of about 170 square kilometers.

Based on these comparisons:
- In terms of population, Natal is significantly larger than Vitória.
- In terms of area, Natal is also larger than Vitória.

Given these differences, the claim that Vitória is a capital the size of Natal is not accurate.

[La importación de energía] no representa más del 8% de la demanda de nuestro país,half true,es,'[The import of energy] does not represent more than 8% of the demand of our country'.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""[The import of energy] does not represent more than 8% of the demand of our country,"" we need to look at the specific data regarding the country's energy imports and total energy demand. This information can typically be found in national energy reports, government publications, or reputable energy databases.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date statistics from a reliable source, we can tentatively evaluate it.

If the data shows that energy imports are indeed less than or equal to 8% of the total energy demand, the claim would be 'True'. If the imports are slightly above 8%, it would be 'Mostly True'. If the imports are significantly higher than 8%, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False' depending on the extent of the discrepancy.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a reasoned judgment based on the assumption that the claim is made with accurate data.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
“El año que viene terminaría con seis puntos menos de PBI per cápita que en 2015”,true,es,"""Next year would end with six points less of GDP per capita than in 2015.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Next year would end with six points less of GDP per capita than in 2015,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Data**: We need to look at the GDP per capita data for 2015 and compare it with the projected GDP per capita for the next year.
2. **Economic Projections**: Economic forecasts from reliable sources (such as the World Bank, IMF, or national statistics agencies) would provide insights into whether such a decline is expected.
3. **Context**: Understanding the economic context, such as any significant events (e.g., economic crises, pandemics, policy changes) that could impact GDP per capita.

Without specific data and projections, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on credible economic forecasts and historical data, we can make an educated guess.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we can only hypothesize based on general economic trends and the plausibility of such a decline. A six-point drop in GDP per capita over several years is significant and would likely be noted in economic reports if it were expected.

**Hypothetical Analysis**:
- If economic reports and forecasts indicate a significant downturn, the claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If there is no substantial evidence or the decline is less severe, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

**Conclusion**:
Without concrete data, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the significant nature of a six-point drop and the need for substantial evidence to support such a claim, it is more likely to be on the less accurate side unless supported by strong economic forecasts.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Somos o país que mais preserva o meio ambiente,false,pt,We are the country that most preserves the environment.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are the country that most preserves the environment,"" we need to consider various factors such as environmental policies, conservation efforts, protected areas, and overall environmental performance.

1. **Environmental Performance Index (EPI)**: The EPI ranks countries based on their environmental health and ecosystem vitality. Countries like Denmark, Switzerland, and Finland often rank high on this index.

2. **Protected Areas**: Some countries have a significant percentage of their land designated as protected areas. For example, Bhutan has over 50% of its land under protection.

3. **Sustainable Practices**: Countries like Costa Rica are known for their sustainable practices and efforts to preserve biodiversity.

4. **Carbon Emissions**: Countries with low carbon emissions per capita and strong renewable energy policies are often considered leaders in environmental preservation.

Given these points, it is unlikely that any single country can definitively claim to be the one that ""most preserves the environment"" without considering the various dimensions and metrics involved.

Publicação na rede social Facebook indica que Portugal tem 10 milhões......,false,pt,A post on the social network Facebook indicates that Portugal has 10 million...,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that Portugal has 10 million people, we need to refer to the most recent and reliable population data.

As of the latest available data in 2023, Portugal's population is approximately 10.3 million people. This figure is close to the 10 million mentioned in the Facebook post, but it is not exact.

Given that the claim is very close to the actual number but not entirely precise, it would be reasonable to categorize it as 'Mostly True'.

Sabe qual o investimento do estado do Rio de Janeiro (...) em inteligência este ano? (...) R$ 283,true,pt,Do you know the investment of the state of Rio de Janeiro (...) in intelligence this year? (...) R$ 283.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the state of Rio de Janeiro invested only R$ 283 in intelligence this year, we need to verify the actual budget and expenditures allocated for intelligence by the state government.

1. **Official Budget Documents**: Check the official budget documents or financial reports released by the state of Rio de Janeiro for the current year. These documents should detail the allocations and expenditures for various sectors, including intelligence.

2. **Government Statements**: Look for any official statements or press releases from the state government or relevant departments that address the budget for intelligence.

3. **News Reports**: Search for credible news reports or articles that discuss the budget allocation for intelligence in Rio de Janeiro. Reputable news sources often analyze and report on government budgets.

4. **Contextual Information**: Consider the context in which the claim was made. Was it a statement by a politician, a media report, or a social media post? The context can sometimes provide clues about the accuracy or intent behind the claim.

Without access to these specific sources and based on the information provided, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, the figure of R$ 283 seems unusually low for a state budget allocation, which raises skepticism about its accuracy.

Given the need for precise verification from reliable sources, and considering the improbability of such a low figure for a state budget allocation, the claim is likely exaggerated or taken out of context.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Il lavoro del futuro: Di Maio usa cifre discutibili,half true,it,The work of the future: Di Maio uses questionable figures.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The work of the future: Di Maio uses questionable figures,"" we need to evaluate the context and the specific figures used by Di Maio. This involves checking the sources of the figures, their accuracy, and how they compare to other reliable data.

1. **Context**: Luigi Di Maio is an Italian politician who has made various statements about the future of work. The claim suggests that the figures he used in his statements are questionable.

2. **Verification**: To verify this, we would need to:
   - Identify the specific figures Di Maio used.
   - Check the sources of these figures.
   - Compare them with data from reliable sources such as government reports, academic studies, or reputable organizations.

3. **Analysis**:
   - If the figures are found to be inaccurate or misleading based on reliable sources, the claim would lean towards 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
   - If the figures are somewhat accurate but taken out of context or slightly exaggerated, the claim might be 'Half True'.
   - If the figures are mostly accurate with minor discrepancies, the claim could be 'Mostly False'.
   - If the figures are accurate and reliable, the claim would be 'False'.

Without specific details on the figures Di Maio used and the context in which they were presented, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, the phrasing ""uses questionable figures"" implies that there is some basis for doubt about the accuracy or reliability of the figures.

"Existem 1.500 guardas (aprovados em concursos, mas não chamados)",true,pt,"There are 1,500 guards (approved in exams, but not called).","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There are 1,500 guards (approved in exams, but not called),"" we would need to verify the following:

1. The total number of guards who have passed the exams.
2. Whether these guards have indeed not been called to duty.

Without specific data or a reliable source to confirm these details, it is not possible to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified information, we could consider it as 'True'. Conversely, if there is no evidence or the numbers are exaggerated or incorrect, it could range from 'Mostly False' to 'False'.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim.

"“No ano de 2009 a gripe h1n1 matou muito mais gente o que covid19 e o seu governo lula não te deu 10 centavos. E mais a midia podre ficou de bico calado não falou em isolamento, nem nada”",false,pt,"""In the year 2009, the H1N1 flu killed many more people than COVID-19, and your government under Lula didn't give you 10 cents. Moreover, the rotten media stayed silent, didn't talk about isolation, or anything.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. **H1N1 flu in 2009**: The H1N1 influenza pandemic, also known as swine flu, did occur in 2009. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the H1N1 pandemic resulted in an estimated 151,700 to 575,400 deaths worldwide during its first year.

2. **COVID-19 deaths**: COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in significantly more deaths globally. As of 2023, the global death toll from COVID-19 is in the millions, far surpassing the death toll from the H1N1 pandemic.

3. **Government response under Lula**: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was the President of Brazil until January 1, 2011. During the H1N1 pandemic, the Brazilian government did take measures to address the outbreak, including vaccination campaigns and public health advisories. However, the scale and nature of the response were different from the extensive measures taken globally for COVID-19, which included lockdowns, economic relief packages, and widespread testing and vaccination campaigns.

4. **Media coverage**: The media did cover the H1N1 pandemic, but the level of coverage and public concern was not as intense as it has been for COVID-19. The nature of the diseases and the global response to them were different, which influenced media coverage.

Given these points:

- The claim that H1N1 killed ""many more people"" than COVID-19 is **False**. COVID-19 has resulted in a significantly higher death toll.
- The claim that the government under Lula didn't provide financial support specifically for H1N1 is **Mostly True**, as the response did not include the kind of economic relief seen during COVID-19.
- The claim that the media stayed silent is **False**. The media did cover the H1N1 pandemic, though not as extensively as COVID-19.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Criação de uma Corregedoria externa, fora da estrutura da Secretaria de Segurança Pública",false,pt,"Creation of an external Corregedoria, outside the structure of the Public Security Secretariat.","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Creation of an external Corregedoria, outside the structure of the Public Security Secretariat,"" we need to evaluate whether such an external oversight body has indeed been established and operates independently of the Public Security Secretariat.

1. **True**: If an external Corregedoria has been created and functions independently of the Public Security Secretariat.
2. **Mostly True**: If an external Corregedoria has been created and mostly operates independently, but there are minor dependencies or overlaps.
3. **Half True**: If there is some form of external oversight, but it is not fully independent or is partially integrated within the Public Security Secretariat.
4. **Mostly False**: If there is minimal or no significant external oversight, and the Corregedoria is largely within the Public Security Secretariat.
5. **False**: If no external Corregedoria exists and all oversight is internal to the Public Security Secretariat.

Without specific details or evidence to confirm the exact nature of the Corregedoria's structure and independence, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the claim alone:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Estamos (...) com recorde de desemprego,false,pt,We are (...) with record unemployment.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are (...) with record unemployment,"" we need to consider the context and the specific time period being referenced. Unemployment rates can vary significantly over time and across different regions. 

1. **Historical Context**: If the claim is made during a period of historically high unemployment, such as during the Great Depression or the COVID-19 pandemic, it could be true or mostly true.
2. **Current Data**: If the claim is made in a period of relatively low unemployment, it would likely be false or mostly false.
3. **Geographical Context**: Unemployment rates can differ by country, state, or even city. A record unemployment rate in one area might not reflect the situation in another.

Without specific data or a clear time frame, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made in a general context without specifying a particular time or place, it is likely to be an exaggeration.

1. **Existence of the Program**: Confirm that there is indeed a program aimed at benefiting children between 0 and 3 years old.
2. **Target Population**: Verify that the program specifically targets children within the age range of 0 to 3 years.
3. **Reach of the Program**: Check if the program has the capacity or has already reached 4 million children by the end of 2018.
4. **Time Frame**: Ensure that the program's benefits are projected or have been achieved by the end of 2018.

Without access to specific data or reports confirming these details, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on official projections or reports from a credible source, we might lean towards a certain level of truthfulness.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

É inadmissível uma dívida – inclusive de bancos e de grandes empresas (...) – [com] a prefeitura de São Paulo que seja da ordem de mais de R$ 130 milhões,false,pt,It is unacceptable for there to be a debt – including from banks and large companies (...) – [with] the São Paulo city hall that amounts to more than R$ 130 million.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""It is unacceptable for there to be a debt – including from banks and large companies (...) – [with] the São Paulo city hall that amounts to more than R$ 130 million,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Existence of Debt**: Confirm if there is indeed a debt owed to the São Paulo city hall by banks and large companies.
2. **Amount of Debt**: Verify if the total debt amounts to more than R$ 130 million.

If both conditions are met, the claim would be considered true. If only one condition is met or if the information is partially correct, the claim would be rated accordingly.

### Verification:

1. **Existence of Debt**:
   - It is a known fact that municipalities often have outstanding debts owed by various entities, including banks and large companies. São Paulo, being a major city, is likely to have such debts.

2. **Amount of Debt**:
   - Reports and official statements from the São Paulo city hall or financial audits would provide the exact figures. If recent data confirms that the debt exceeds R$ 130 million, this part of the claim would be true.

### Conclusion:
Based on available information and typical financial scenarios in large cities, it is plausible that the São Paulo city hall has outstanding debts from banks and large companies that could amount to more than R$ 130 million. However, without specific and up-to-date data, the exact figure cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty.

"Há 56 anos, um violento confronto entre as forças policiais da RDA, e......",true,pt,"'56 years ago, a violent confrontation between the police forces of the GDR, and......'.","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to establish the historical context and verify the details. The German Democratic Republic (GDR) existed from 1949 to 1990. Therefore, 56 years ago from 2023 would be 1967. 

In 1967, there were indeed several instances of violent confrontations between police forces and citizens in the GDR, particularly related to political dissent and protests. One notable event was the June 2, 1967, protest in West Berlin (though not in the GDR, it involved East German students and had significant repercussions in East Germany). However, specific details about a violent confrontation directly involving GDR police forces in 1967 are less well-documented.

Given the general historical context, the claim is plausible but lacks specific details to be fully verified.

(...) Nossa expectativa é que [as membranas e cortinas de contenção de rejeitos instaladas em Pará de Minas] seja o suficiente para conter esse rejeito e não permitir nenhum problema para a captação de água do Rio [Paraopeba],false,pt,Our expectation is that [the membranes and tailings containment curtains installed in Pará de Minas] will be sufficient to contain these tailings and prevent any problems for the water intake from the [Paraopeba] River.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the effectiveness of the membranes and tailings containment curtains in Pará de Minas in containing tailings and preventing problems for the water intake from the Paraopeba River. This involves understanding the engineering and environmental assessments of these containment measures.

1. **Effectiveness of Containment Measures**: If the membranes and containment curtains are designed and installed according to high standards and have been tested to withstand the specific conditions of the area, they are likely to be effective. However, no containment system can guarantee 100% effectiveness due to unforeseen circumstances such as extreme weather events or structural failures.

2. **Historical Data and Expert Opinions**: If there is historical data or expert opinions suggesting that similar containment measures have been effective in similar situations, this would support the claim. Conversely, if there have been failures or significant doubts expressed by experts, this would weaken the claim.

3. **Regulatory and Environmental Oversight**: The involvement of regulatory bodies and environmental oversight can provide additional assurance about the effectiveness of the containment measures. If these bodies have approved the measures and continue to monitor them, it adds credibility to the claim.

Given that the claim expresses an expectation rather than a definitive statement, and assuming that the containment measures have been designed and implemented according to best practices, the claim can be considered cautiously optimistic but not guaranteed.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
“En ningún país del mundo un gobierno se rige con un presupuesto opositor”,half true,es,"""In no country in the world does a government operate with an opposition budget.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the context in which governments operate and manage budgets. Typically, in democratic systems, the ruling government is responsible for creating and implementing the national budget. The opposition may critique, propose amendments, or offer alternative budgets, but they do not have the authority to enforce their budget unless they come into power.

In parliamentary systems, the government (executive branch) presents the budget, and it must be approved by the legislature. The opposition can debate and suggest changes, but the final budget is the responsibility of the ruling government. In presidential systems, the executive branch also proposes the budget, which must be approved by the legislative branch. Again, the opposition can influence the process but does not control the budget.

Given this understanding, the claim that ""In no country in the world does a government operate with an opposition budget"" is generally accurate. The opposition does not have the power to enforce their budget while they are not in power.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the Extra group (a known retail chain) has made any official announcements or press releases about donating more than 15 million reais in products during the pandemic.
2. **Reputation and History**: Evaluate the credibility of the Extra group and their history of similar charitable activities.
3. **Context and Timing**: Confirm if the timing of the claim aligns with the peak periods of the pandemic when such donations would be most relevant.
4. **Scam Indicators**: Assess if the method of soliciting interest (commenting 'ok') is typical for legitimate charitable activities or if it resembles common scam tactics.

Given the information provided and without additional verification from official sources, the claim has several red flags, such as the solicitation method, which is often used in scams. However, without concrete evidence to fully disprove it, we cannot definitively label it as 'False'.

If the commitment is partially accurate or lacks significant details, it could be 'Half True'. If the claim is largely inaccurate but contains a small element of truth, it would be 'Mostly False'. If there is no evidence or the claim is entirely inaccurate, it would be 'False'.

Given the information provided, I cannot verify the specific details of BNDES's commitments. However, if we assume the context is accurate and BNDES has indeed made such a statement, the claim would be 'True'.

Marcelo Bretas is a well-known Federal Judge in Brazil who has been involved in the Lava Jato operation, specifically in Rio de Janeiro. The Lava Jato operation is a large corruption investigation that has implicated numerous politicians and business leaders in Brazil.

Given this information, the claim that Marcelo Bretas is a Federal Judge of the Lava Jato operation in Rio de Janeiro is accurate.

“El mecanismo tendrá un sesgo hacia los que menos tienen”,false,es,"""The mechanism will have a bias towards those who have less.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The mechanism will have a bias towards those who have less,"" we need to understand the context and specifics of the mechanism being referred to. Without additional context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, we can make some general observations.

If the mechanism in question is designed to provide support, resources, or opportunities to those who are disadvantaged or have fewer resources, then the claim could be considered accurate. For example, many social welfare programs, progressive taxation systems, or affirmative action policies are designed with a bias towards helping those who have less.

On the other hand, if the mechanism is not explicitly designed to favor those with fewer resources, or if it operates in a way that does not consistently benefit them, then the claim would be less accurate.

In 2013, the Brazilian government, under President Dilma Rousseff of the PT, launched the ""Mais Médicos"" (More Doctors) program. This initiative aimed to address the shortage of medical professionals in underserved and remote areas of Brazil. As part of this program, Brazil entered into an agreement with Cuba to bring Cuban doctors to work in these regions.

The agreement indeed resulted in a significant number of Cuban doctors coming to Brazil. Reports indicate that around 11,000 Cuban doctors participated in the program over time. Therefore, the claim that the agreement brought 10,000 doctors to Brazil is quite close to the actual number.

Given this context, the claim is accurate but slightly underestimates the total number of Cuban doctors involved.

This involves checking reliable sources such as official records of the Chamber of Deputies sessions, reputable news outlets, or direct statements from Talíria Petrone herself.

1. **Context and Verification**: 
   - If Talíria Petrone did indeed make a statement during a session in the Chamber of Deputies, it should be recorded in the official transcripts or videos of the session.
   - Reputable news sources or her official social media accounts might also provide context or clarification regarding her statement.

2. **Interpretation**:
   - The claim suggests that she stated police officers are ""paid to die"" in combat against organized crime. This is a strong and specific assertion that implies a certain perspective on the role and risks associated with police work.

3. **Checking Sources**:
   - If the statement is found in the official records or credible news sources, we need to ensure it is not taken out of context or misinterpreted.

Given the need for precise verification and context, without access to the exact records or reliable sources confirming the statement as quoted, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if the statement is accurately quoted and contextually correct, it would be evaluated based on its factual accuracy and context.

**Hypothetical Analysis**:
- If the statement is accurately quoted and contextually correct, it might be interpreted as a critique of the dangerous conditions police officers face, rather than a literal assertion that they are ""paid to die.""

1. **Investment in Stadiums**: According to various reports, Brazil spent approximately $3 billion (around 6.7 billion BRL) on stadiums for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

2. **Investment in Education and Health**: According to data from the Brazilian government, the combined annual budget for education and health during this period was significantly higher. For instance, in 2013 alone, the federal budget for education was around 94 billion BRL, and for health, it was around 90 billion BRL. This totals approximately 184 billion BRL for just one year.

To compare:
- Total investment in stadiums (2010-2013): ~6.7 billion BRL
- Annual investment in education and health (2013): ~184 billion BRL

If we consider the annual investment in education and health over four years (2010-2013), it would be approximately 736 billion BRL (184 billion BRL per year * 4 years).

Now, let's calculate the ratio:
- 736 billion BRL (education and health over four years) / 6.7 billion BRL (stadiums) ≈ 110 times

This ratio is significantly lower than the claimed 212 times.

Espalhou-se pelas redes sociais um artigo sobre uma suposta vacina co......,mostly true,pt,An article about an alleged vaccine co...... spread across social media.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""an article about an alleged vaccine co...... spread across social media,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Verification of the Article**: Is there an actual article that discusses an alleged vaccine conspiracy?
2. **Spread on Social Media**: Has this article been widely shared or discussed on social media platforms?

Without specific details about the content of the article or the extent of its spread, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, given the phrasing ""alleged vaccine co......,"" it suggests that the article's content is not verified and is based on allegations, which often tend to spread on social media due to the platform's nature of amplifying sensational content.

Given the general tendency for unverified or sensational claims to spread on social media, it is reasonable to infer that the claim about the article spreading could be accurate.

"Bom dia, Essa bactéria foi transmitida pela saliva do cachorro, olha o perigo q corre quando vc deixa o cachorro lamber sua boca",false,pt,"Good morning, This bacteria was transmitted through the dog's saliva, see the danger you face when you let the dog lick your mouth.","Final Answer: Mostly True

Explanation: While it is relatively rare, certain bacteria present in a dog's saliva, such as Capnocytophaga canimorsus, can be transmitted to humans and potentially cause serious infections. This is more likely to occur in individuals with weakened immune systems. Therefore, it is generally advisable to avoid letting dogs lick your mouth to minimize any potential risk.",mostly true,False,False
"‌ ‌“Cuando nosotros llegamos en diciembre nos encontramos un Banco Central lánguido, sin reservas, vacío”‌ ‌",false,es,"""When we arrived in December, we found a languid Central Bank, without reserves, empty.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding the statement. The claim suggests that upon arrival in December, the Central Bank was found to be languid, without reserves, and empty.

1. **Languid Central Bank**: This implies that the Central Bank was inactive or not functioning effectively. To verify this, we would need information on the Central Bank's activities, policies, and overall performance during that period.

2. **Without Reserves**: This suggests that the Central Bank had no financial reserves. Central Banks typically hold reserves in the form of foreign currency, gold, or other assets. We would need data on the Central Bank's reserve levels at that time to confirm this.

3. **Empty**: This could mean a lack of personnel, resources, or operational capacity. Again, specific details about the Central Bank's staffing, resources, and operations would be necessary to verify this part of the claim.

Without specific data or evidence to support or refute these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on a subjective assessment or a particular perspective, it might not be entirely accurate or could be an exaggeration.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
“Se perdieron 152 mil empleos registrados del sector privado”,true,es,"""152,000 registered private sector jobs were lost.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""152,000 registered private sector jobs were lost,"" we would need to verify the data from a reliable source such as government labor statistics, economic reports, or credible news outlets. Without access to the specific data or context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on a specific time period or event (e.g., a recent economic downturn, a specific month, or year), we would need to cross-reference it with official employment statistics from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or equivalent authoritative bodies in other countries.

Given the lack of specific data and context in this scenario, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I must refrain from categorizing it without further information.

Without specific details about the Twitter post or the government's intention, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.

Given the lack of specific details, the most cautious and balanced assessment would be:
