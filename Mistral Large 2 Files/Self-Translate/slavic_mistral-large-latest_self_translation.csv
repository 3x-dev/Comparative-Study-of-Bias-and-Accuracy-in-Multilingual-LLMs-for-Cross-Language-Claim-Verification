"“Što se tiče tramvaja, oni nisu mogli da prođu zbog okupljenih građana, a saobraćaj je normalizovan posle završetka protesta.”",false,sr,"""As for the trams, they could not pass due to the gathered citizens, and traffic was normalized after the end of the protest.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and the information provided. The claim states that trams could not pass due to gathered citizens and that traffic was normalized after the end of the protest. Without additional context or verification, we can analyze the statement based on typical scenarios in such situations.

1. **Trams could not pass due to gathered citizens**: This is plausible, as protests often block streets and public transportation routes.
2. **Traffic was normalized after the end of the protest**: This is also plausible, as once the protest ends, streets are usually cleared, allowing normal traffic flow to resume.

Given that both parts of the claim are plausible and likely in a protest scenario, the claim can be considered mostly accurate. However, without specific evidence or additional context, we cannot confirm it as entirely true.

"Медианный размер средней зарплаты в январе составлял 112 тыс тенге. А модальный, то есть самый распространенный размер зарплаты, составляет 58 тыс тенге.",true,ru,"'The median size of the average salary in January was 112 thousand tenge. And the modal, that is, the most common size of the salary, is 58 thousand tenge.'","To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the definitions of median and mode in the context of salary data.

- **Median**: The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from lowest to highest. It represents the value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data sample.
- **Mode**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is the most common value.

Given that the median salary is 112 thousand tenge and the modal (most common) salary is 58 thousand tenge, these values can indeed exist in the same dataset. The median being higher than the mode is not uncommon, especially in datasets with a skewed distribution, where a few high values can pull the median up while the most common value remains lower.

Therefore, the statement is plausible and could be true.

„Demokratska stranka je ispunila sve ono što je pre četiri godine obećala.“,false,sr,"""The Democratic Party has fulfilled everything it promised four years ago.""","To evaluate the claim ""The Democratic Party has fulfilled everything it promised four years ago,"" we need to consider the party's platform, campaign promises, and the legislative and executive actions taken during that period.

It's important to note that no political party can realistically fulfill every promise made during a campaign due to various factors such as political opposition, changes in priorities, and unforeseen events. Here are a few considerations:

1. **Legislative Achievements**: The Democratic Party, under the Biden administration, has passed significant legislation such as the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. These address some of the promises made, including economic relief, infrastructure improvements, and climate action.

2. **Executive Actions**: The administration has also taken executive actions on issues like immigration, climate change, and healthcare, aligning with some campaign promises.

3. **Unfulfilled Promises**: However, there are notable promises that have not been fully delivered on, such as comprehensive immigration reform, certain healthcare initiatives, and some economic policies.

Given these points, it is fair to say that while the Democratic Party has made significant progress on many of its promises, it has not fulfilled everything it promised four years ago.

Since I don't have real-time access to specific current events or negotiations, I'll provide a general framework for evaluating such claims.

1. **True**: If official statements from both the Ministry of Education and relevant authorities in Niš confirm that negotiations are progressing and that the opening of the Theological Faculty is imminent.
2. **Mostly True**: If there are credible reports and partial confirmations from official sources that negotiations are positive and moving forward, but the final outcome is not yet certain.

However, based on the statement itself, it acknowledges the increase but also expresses caution about its long-term implications.

1. **Official Records**: Check the official records of legislative proposals sent to the Assembly by the government since the beginning of the year.
2. **Definition of ""Pro-European""**: Clarify what constitutes a ""pro-European"" legislative proposal. This could include proposals that aim to strengthen ties with the European Union, adopt EU regulations, or promote European integration.
3. **Timeline**: Ensure that the assessment covers the period from the beginning of the year up to the present.

Without access to specific official records or detailed information on the legislative proposals, we can't definitively determine the truth of the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have conducted a thorough review of the legislative proposals and found the following:

- **No Pro-European Proposals**: If there are no legislative proposals that can be categorized as pro-European, the claim would be 'True'.
- **Few Pro-European Proposals**: If there are a few proposals but they are minor or not significant, the claim could be 'Mostly True'.
- **Some Pro-European Proposals**: If there are a notable number of pro-European proposals but not a majority, the claim could be 'Half True'.
- **Significant Pro-European Proposals**: If there are many pro-European proposals but they are overshadowed by non-pro-European proposals, the claim could be 'Mostly False'.
- **Many Pro-European Proposals**: If there are numerous pro-European proposals sent to the Assembly, the claim would be 'False'.

- Over 4.5 million citizens received assistance.
- Each received 42,500 tenge.
- More than 450 billion tenge was spent on this.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent based on the number of citizens and the amount each received:

\[ \text{Total spent} = 4,500,000 \text{ citizens} \times 42,500 \text{ tenge/citizen} \]

\[ \text{Total spent} = 191,250,000,000 \text{ tenge} \]

This calculation shows that the total amount spent would be 191.25 billion tenge if exactly 4.5 million citizens received 42,500 tenge each.

However, the claim states that more than 450 billion tenge was spent. The calculated amount (191.25 billion tenge) is significantly less than 450 billion tenge. Therefore, the numbers provided in the claim do not match.

It also compares this to the space allocated for prisoners, which is 3 m².

To determine the accuracy of this claim, it is necessary to verify the changes in regulations regarding kindergarten space requirements in 2018 and compare them to the space allocated for prisoners.

1. **Kindergarten Space Requirements:**
   - The claim mentions that the space requirement per child has been reduced to 2.25 m² and 1.87 m² for facilities operating up to 5 hours a day. This specific detail would need to be verified with official documents or regulations issued in 2018.

2. **Prisoner Space Allocation:**
   - The claim states that each prisoner is allocated 3 m². This information would need to be verified with official prison regulations or standards.

Without specific verification from official sources, it is challenging to definitively confirm or deny the accuracy of these figures. However, the claim presents specific numbers and makes a direct comparison, suggesting that it is based on some form of official data or regulations.

2. **Market Dynamics**: Other factors such as supply and demand, currency exchange rates, and manufacturer pricing strategies also influence the final price of goods.

3. **Product-Specific Factors**: Different products may be affected differently by tariff changes. For example, some products might see a more significant price reduction than others.

2. **Firearm Regulations**: Poland requires permits for firearm ownership, which are not easy to obtain. However, other European countries also have stringent regulations.

3. **Comparative Data**: According to available data, countries like the United Kingdom and Germany have lower rates of civilian gun ownership per capita compared to Poland. This suggests that Poland is not the most thoroughly disarmed nation in Europe.

""Changes in local authority boundaries shall not be made without prior consultation of the local communities concerned, possibly by means of a referendum where this is permitted by statute.""

The claim states that a referendum should be held if boundaries are to be changed, which aligns with the Charter's provision that consultation, possibly by means of a referendum, is required.

This is a growth that has not been recorded before.',"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two main aspects:

1. **Salary Increase**: The statement claims that the salary in the national economy has increased by 20% over the past 2.5 years.
2. **Historic Comparison**: The statement also claims that this growth has not been recorded before.

Without specific data, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, we can analyze it based on general economic principles and typical salary growth patterns.

1. **Salary Increase**: A 20% increase over 2.5 years is significant but not implausible, especially considering factors like economic growth, inflation adjustments, and policy changes.
2. **Historic Comparison**: Claiming that this growth has not been recorded before is a strong statement and would require historical data to verify. Economic records often show fluctuations, and while a 20% increase is notable, it is not necessarily unprecedented.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the historic claim and the plausibility of the salary increase, the most balanced assessment would be:

"Największa liczba Polaków emigrowała w czasie rządów PiS- u, nawet 0,5 mln rocznie, dziś to jest 50-60 tysięcy, 8 razy mniej.",half true,pl,"'The largest number of Poles emigrated during the PiS government's rule, even up to 0.5 million annually, today it is 50-60 thousand, 8 times less.'","To evaluate the claim that ""The largest number of Poles emigrated during the PiS government's rule, even up to 0.5 million annually, today it is 50-60 thousand, 8 times less,"" we need to consider both the historical data on Polish emigration and the current numbers.

1. **PiS Government's Rule**: The PiS (Law and Justice) party has been in power in Poland since 2015. Therefore, we need to look at emigration data from 2015 onwards.

2. **Emigration Numbers**: According to available data, the highest recorded emigration numbers for Poles were not during the PiS government's rule. The peak of Polish emigration was in the years following Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004, with numbers reaching around 2 million over several years.

3. **Current Emigration Numbers**: Recent data suggests that annual emigration from Poland has indeed decreased, but the figures are not as low as 50-60 thousand. The numbers are closer to a few hundred thousand annually.

Given these points, the claim that the largest number of Poles emigrated during the PiS government's rule and that current numbers are as low as 50-60 thousand is inaccurate.

1. **Import of Vaccines**: Whether vaccines were indeed imported.
2. **National Expertise**: Whether the import was done without national expertise.
3. **WHO-Recommended Organizations**: Whether the import was facilitated through organizations recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Without specific context or additional information about the situation being referred to, it is difficult to verify the claim's accuracy. However, let's break down the claim logically:

- **Import of Vaccines**: This part could be true if there is evidence of vaccine imports.
- **Without National Expertise**: This part is more subjective and would require details on the involvement of national experts. It is unlikely that vaccines would be imported without any input from national health authorities, but the extent of their involvement could vary.
- **WHO-Recommended Organizations**: This part could be true if the organizations involved are indeed recommended by the WHO.

Given the lack of specific details and the subjective nature of the claim regarding national expertise, the most balanced evaluation would be:

While it is true that the Chinese government heavily censors literature and that works by authors like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, which are critical of authoritarian regimes, are often restricted or banned, the claim that distributing his books is a criminal offense is an overstatement. The censorship in China is more nuanced and often involves blocking access to such materials rather than outright criminalizing their distribution.

According to various economic sources, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the global economy did indeed experience modest growth in 2010 following the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The actual growth rates varied by country, but generally, many developed economies saw growth rates around 1 to 1.5 percent.

For example:
- The United States experienced a growth rate of about 2.5% in 2010.
- The Eurozone had a growth rate of around 2%.
- Japan had a growth rate of about 4%.

While these rates are higher than the 1 to 1.5 percent range mentioned in the claim, they are still significantly lower than the pre-crisis growth rates of 5 to 7 percent. The claim correctly captures the trend of modest growth compared to previous years.

Therefore, considering the overall context and the general accuracy of the statement regarding economic growth trends in 2010, the claim can be considered mostly accurate.

While it's true that cattle populations have fluctuated over time due to various factors such as changes in agricultural practices, economic conditions, and environmental factors, it is not accurate to say that the number of cattle has been constantly decreasing without exception. There have been periods of increase as well as decrease.

While the book does mention a virus called Wuhan-400, the similarities largely end there. The fictional Wuhan-400 is a biological weapon with a 100% fatality rate, developed in labs outside the city, and has different characteristics from the actual coronavirus (COVID-19). The coincidence of the name and location has led to misinterpretations, but it does not constitute a prediction of the coronavirus pandemic as we know it.

Paweł Adamowicz was indeed a member of the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) party in Poland. However, he did not leave the party due to legal issues but rather due to political differences. Adamowicz was known for his independent stance and was eventually expelled from the party in 2015 after he refused to support the party's candidate for the presidential election.

Given this context, the claim that the Platform parted ways with him due to his legal issues is not accurate.

- Germany is indeed Serbia's largest trading partner.
- Italy is one of Serbia's major trading partners, often ranking second in terms of total trade volume.
- Italy is also a significant destination for Serbian exports, often ranking as one of the top destinations.

Given these points, the claim that ""Italy is, after Germany, the second foreign trade partner of Serbia, but the first export destination for our companies"" is generally accurate. While Italy might not always be the absolute first export destination, it is a major one, and the claim aligns closely with the overall trade dynamics.

2. **Data Accuracy**: The percentage (94%) needs to be cross-referenced with actual data to ensure it is accurate.
3. **Scope of Corrections**: The claim mentions ""all irregularities,"" which should be defined clearly and matched with the actions taken by the government.

Without specific data and verification from independent sources, it is difficult to ascertain the exact truthfulness of the claim. However, the specificity of the percentage (94%) suggests that there might be some data backing it up, but it could also be an exaggeration or misinterpretation.

- As of recent data, the minimum hourly wage in Poland has been increasing steadily but not to the extent mentioned.
- The claim that the minimum hourly rate was 5 PLN 5 years ago is likely incorrect, as minimum wage levels have historically been higher than that.

Without specific data on Kazakhstan's inflation rates, household expenditures, and the methodology used to arrive at the 225 billion tenge figure, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can offer a general approach to assessing such claims.

1. **Official Inflation Rates:** Verify the official inflation rates from a reliable source, such as the country's central bank or statistical agency.

2. **Household Expenditures:** Check if there are studies or reports that detail the increase in household food expenses over the specified period.

3. **Calculation Methodology:** Ensure that the methodology used to calculate the additional 225 billion tenge is transparent and based on credible data.

2. **Children in OECD countries are constantly improving their reading literacy scores.**

Let's analyze these points:

1. **PISA results indicate a decline in students' literacy:**
   - The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study by the OECD in member and non-member nations intended to evaluate educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading.
   - The claim suggests a decline in literacy but does not specify which country or context. Without specific data, this part of the claim is ambiguous.

2. **Children in OECD countries are constantly improving their reading literacy scores:**
   - PISA reports and analyses over the years have shown mixed results. Some OECD countries have improved, while others have shown stagnation or decline in reading literacy scores.
   - It is not accurate to say that children in OECD countries are ""constantly improving"" their reading literacy scores across the board.

Given these points, the claim that ""children in OECD countries are constantly improving their reading literacy scores"" is not supported by the data, which shows varied trends. The claim about a decline in literacy is ambiguous without specific context.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Surplus Comparison**: The claim mentions a surplus of 320 million dollars in the first six months, which is more than half of the previous year's total annual surplus of 600 million dollars. This suggests that the agricultural sector is performing well despite the economic crisis.

2. **Accuracy of Predictions**: The claim that the government's predictions were accurate is supported by the surplus figures provided. However, without additional data on the overall economic context or the specific predictions made by the government, it's challenging to fully verify the accuracy of the predictions.

3. **Contextual Information**: The claim does not provide specific details about the government's predictions or the broader economic indicators, which would help in making a more precise evaluation.

To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the numbers against reliable sources.

In most governments, the number of ministers and deputy ministers can vary, and it's essential to check the specific country and current government structure. For the sake of this evaluation, let's assume we are referring to a typical parliamentary system.

Generally, the number of ministers in a cabinet can range from about 20 to 30, depending on the country and the government's structure. The number of deputy ministers can also vary widely but is typically less than the number of ministers.

Without specific data for the government in question, we can make a general assessment:

- The claim of 22 ministers is plausible for many governments.
- The claim of 106 deputy ministers is unusually high and not typical for most governments.

1. **""LSNS's opening refers to the regime created by the Nazi collaborator Father Tiso""**: This part of the claim suggests that LSNS (Ľudová strana Naše Slovensko, People's Party Our Slovakia) has some connection or affinity with the regime of Jozef Tiso, who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II.

2. **""calls for violence""**: This implies that LSNS actively promotes or advocates for violent actions.

3. **""organizes militias""**: This suggests that LSNS is involved in organizing armed or paramilitary groups.

4. **""Fascists received 8% of the votes""**: This indicates that LSNS, characterized as a fascist party, received 8% of the votes in an election.

Without specific evidence or context for each component, it's difficult to verify the claim entirely. However, based on general knowledge and typical assessments of political parties:

- **Affinity with Tiso's regime**: LSNS has been criticized for its far-right views and admiration for the wartime Slovak State, which Tiso led. This part could be considered mostly true.

- **Calls for violence**: This is a strong claim and would require specific evidence of LSNS leaders or official statements advocating for violence. Without such evidence, this part is likely mostly false.

- **Organizes militias**: Again, this would require specific evidence of LSNS organizing armed groups. Without such evidence, this part is likely mostly false.

- **8% of the votes**: This is a factual claim that can be easily verified through election results. If LSNS did receive 8% of the votes in a specific election, this part would be true.

Given the mix of potentially true and mostly false components, the overall claim seems to be a blend of accurate and exaggerated or unverified information.

2. **35th Place in the World**: This is also a specific and verifiable claim that would be supported by the same report.

If both points are accurately reflected in the Doing Business report for the specified year, the claim would be considered true. If there are minor discrepancies or partial truths, it might be considered mostly true. If significant discrepancies exist, it could be considered mostly false or false.

„Dvadeset pet procenata nezaposlenosti nema nigde drugde na Balkanu!“,mostly false,sr,"""Twenty-five percent unemployment is nowhere else on the Balkans!""","To evaluate the claim ""Twenty-five percent unemployment is nowhere else on the Balkans,"" we need to examine the unemployment rates in the Balkan region. As of the most recent data available (up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023), unemployment rates vary significantly among Balkan countries. While some countries may have unemployment rates lower than 25%, others might have higher rates.

For example, according to recent data:
- Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania typically have unemployment rates lower than 25%.
- Countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and North Macedonia often have higher unemployment rates, sometimes approaching or exceeding 25%.

Given this variability, it is not accurate to claim that ""Twenty-five percent unemployment is nowhere else on the Balkans."" Some countries in the Balkans have indeed experienced unemployment rates at or above 25% at various times.

This is the European average.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two parts: the number of doctors in Poland and whether this number is around the European average.

1. **Number of Doctors in Poland:**
   - According to various sources, such as the World Health Organization and Eurostat, the number of doctors in Poland is indeed around 150,000. This part of the claim is accurate.

2. **European Average:**
   - The European average for the number of doctors per country varies, but generally, Poland's ratio of doctors to population is close to the European average. However, it's important to note that the average can fluctuate based on the specific data source and the year of the data.

Given these points, the claim that there are approximately 149,000 doctors in Poland and that this is around the European average is mostly accurate, but the precision of the European average comparison might be subject to variation.

They were 'ground down' here in the Sejm,"" we need to consider the verifiability of the following points:

1. Whether the speaker was part of the UPR (Union of Real Politics) when the signatures were collected.
2. Whether 140,000 signatures were indeed collected for a bill introducing the death penalty.
3. Whether these signatures were ""ground down"" in the Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament).

Without specific historical records or verification from credible sources, it's challenging to confirm the exact numbers and actions. However, based on common knowledge and typical political processes, collecting signatures for legislation and having them dismissed or ignored by parliament is plausible.

"Ile było głosów nieważnych, teraz w wyborach prezydenckich? 1%?",true,pl,'How many invalid votes were there in the current presidential election? 1%?',"To accurately assess the claim about the percentage of invalid votes in the current presidential election, specific data from reliable sources such as official election commissions or independent election monitoring bodies would be needed. Without such data, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

However, for the sake of providing a framework for analysis, let's consider the following:

1. **Context**: The percentage of invalid votes can vary significantly between elections and countries.
2. **Verification**: Official reports or statements from election authorities are typically the most reliable sources for such information.
3. **Comparison**: If the claim is that 1% of the votes were invalid, this would need to be compared against the actual reported percentage of invalid votes.

Given the lack of specific data in your prompt, a general approach would be to check official election results and compare the reported percentage of invalid votes to the claimed 1%.

If the official data shows a percentage close to 1%, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the percentage is significantly different, it might be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

However, without specific data or a source to verify the claim, we can only provide a hypothetical analysis. Here's how you might approach the verification process:

1. **Check the Average Salaries in Dinars:** Look for official statistics or reliable sources that provide the average salary range in dinars for the current year.

2. **Convert Dinars to Euros:** Use the current exchange rate to convert the average salary range from dinars to euros.

3. **Compare with Regional Average:** Find data on average salaries in the region to see if the converted amounts (320 to 330 euros) align with regional standards.

Given that we don't have the actual data for verification, we'll assume the process would yield the following hypothetical results:

- **If the average salaries in dinars fall within the range of 34,000 to 35,000:** This part of the claim is true.
- **If the conversion to euros results in a range of 320 to 330 euros:** This part of the claim is true.
- **If the regional average salaries are indeed around 320 to 330 euros:** This part of the claim is true.

1. **Soviet Period Fishing Industry**: During the Soviet period, the fishing industry in Kazakhstan was indeed well-developed and profitable. The Aral Sea, one of the largest lakes in the world at that time, was a significant source of fish.

2. **Gross Fish Production**: The volume of gross fish production exceeding 80 thousand tons per year is plausible, given the historical data on the Aral Sea's productivity.

3. **Current Decline**: The total volume of bioresource extraction has indeed decreased significantly. This is primarily due to the environmental disaster of the Aral Sea, which has shrunk dramatically due to irrigation projects, leading to a collapse in fish stocks.

However, the exact figures and the extent of the decrease might vary, and the claim doesn't provide specific current figures to compare with the historical data.

Given these points, the claim is largely accurate but could be more precise with additional data.

According to recent data from the European Commission and other international organizations, Iceland is known for having one of the smallest gender pay gaps in the world. Luxembourg and Belgium also generally have relatively smaller gender pay gaps compared to many other countries. Greece, while it has made improvements, tends to have a slightly larger gender pay gap compared to Iceland, Luxembourg, and Belgium.

Given this information, the claim that Luxembourg, Belgium, Iceland, and Greece are in a narrow group with smaller gender pay gaps is mostly accurate, although Greece's inclusion might slightly weaken the strength of the claim.

Here are some steps to verify the claim:

1. **Check Official Statistics**: Look at official reports from organizations like Eurostat, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), or national immigration agencies. These sources provide data on asylum applications, including the number of applications from Serbia and the outcomes of these applications.

2. **Assess Trends**: Analyze the trends over the past few years to determine if there has been a decrease in the number of asylum applications from Serbia that were rejected or deemed false.

3. **Consider Definitions**: Ensure a clear understanding of what constitutes a ""false asylum seeker."" This typically refers to applicants whose claims are found to be unfounded or fraudulent.

4. **Review Expert Analysis**: Check statements and reports from experts in the field of migration and asylum to see if they corroborate the claim.

Without access to real-time data or specific reports, a general assessment based on typical patterns is as follows:

- If recent reports and data show a consistent decline in the number of rejected asylum applications from Serbia, the claim would be supported.
- If the data is mixed or shows only slight variations, the claim might be partially true.
- If the data shows no significant change or an increase, the claim would be false.

Given the need for specific data to make a precise determination, the most cautious approach is to label the claim as 'Half True' unless clear evidence supports a stronger conclusion.

2. **Polish Constitution and EU Law** - According to EU treaties, EU law takes precedence over national law, including constitutional law, in areas where the EU has competence.

Given these points, the CJEU does have the right and obligation to point out inconsistencies between national law (including constitutional law) and EU law. This is part of its role in ensuring the uniform application of EU law.

2. **""In the United Kingdom, only 75% of people are vaccinated, similarly in Switzerland – that is 75%, in Poland it is 99.99%.""**
   - This part of the claim provides specific vaccination rates for the UK, Switzerland, and Poland.

Let's examine the given vaccination rates:

- **United Kingdom**: As of recent data, the UK has a vaccination rate of around 75%, which aligns with the claim.
- **Switzerland**: As of recent data, Switzerland has a vaccination rate of around 70%, which is slightly lower than the claim but generally in the same range.
- **Poland**: As of recent data, Poland's vaccination rate is significantly lower than 99.99%. The actual rate is closer to 60-70%.

Given these points:

- The claim about the UK and Switzerland having around 75% vaccination rates is generally accurate.
- The claim about Poland having a 99.99% vaccination rate is grossly inaccurate.

Given that governments often implement regulations to support agricultural sectors, especially during crucial periods like autumn sowing, it is plausible that such a regulation could have been adopted.

They developed twice as slowly as we did [Poland],"" we need to consider the economic growth rates of Hungary (referred to as ""The Second Budapest"") and Poland over a relevant period.

First, let's define what is meant by ""significantly slower economic growth."" This typically refers to a notable difference in the rate of economic expansion between two entities over a given period.

Next, we need to compare the actual economic growth rates of Hungary and Poland. According to various economic indicators and reports, Poland has indeed outpaced Hungary in terms of economic growth over the past few decades. For example, data from the World Bank and other international organizations show that Poland has generally had higher GDP growth rates than Hungary. However, the specific claim that Hungary developed ""twice as slowly"" requires precise numerical data to verify.

Without exact figures at hand, we can rely on general trends and reputable sources that indicate Poland's economic growth has been stronger than Hungary's, but whether it is precisely ""twice as slow"" would need verification from detailed economic data.

Given the available information and general economic trends, the claim is likely an exaggeration but contains some truth. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

1. **Priests' Tax:**
   - The claim states that priests pay 243 PLN in lump-sum tax quarterly.
   - In Poland, priests often have specific tax arrangements, which might include lower tax rates or different taxation methods compared to other taxpayers.

2. **Average Taxpayer's Tax:**
   - The claim states that the average taxpayer pays 2500 PLN quarterly in lump-sum tax from the PIT (Personal Income Tax).
   - The average taxpayer's tax can vary greatly depending on their income and other factors, but the claim suggests a specific quarterly amount.

Given the complexity of tax systems and the potential for specific provisions for priests, it is difficult to verify the exact amounts without detailed knowledge of Polish tax law. However, the significant difference in the amounts (243 PLN vs. 2500 PLN) suggests that there might be some truth to the claim, but it could also oversimplify the actual tax situation.

**Final Answer:** Mostly True

The statement suggests that reversing a certain law or policy to return pensions to a previous level would result in reducing pensions for 80 percent of pensioners. Without specific details about the pension system, the law in question, or the IMF's demands, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim.

1. **Demographics**: Italy has a predominantly Catholic population, with Islam being the second-largest religion due to immigration rather than conversion.
2. **Conversion Rates**: There is no significant data to suggest a ""massive"" conversion of Italians to Islam. Conversions do occur, but they are not at a scale that would justify the term ""massively.""

1. The average salary in January was over 460 euros, specifically 462 euros.
2. This salary is 40 percent higher compared to the average salary when the speaker became the Prime Minister in 2014.

Let's analyze each part:

1. **Average Salary in January**: To verify this, we would need official data from a reliable source, such as the national statistical office of Serbia. Without this data, we cannot confirm if the average salary was indeed 462 euros in January.

2. **40 Percent Increase**: Again, we need historical data to compare the average salary when the speaker became Prime Minister in 2014 with the current average salary. If the average salary in 2014 was X, then a 40 percent increase would be \( X \times 1.40 \). We would need to know the value of X to verify this claim.

Without official data to confirm both parts of the claim, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, based on the information provided, we can make a reasonable assumption about the likelihood of the claim being accurate.

**Final Answer: Half True**

Without specific data on each government's structure, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, it is known that many countries in Europe and the Western Balkans have ministries or agencies dedicated to gender equality, often positioned at high levels within the government.

Given the lack of specific data to compare all governments, the claim that this particular government is ""unique"" in all of Europe in this respect is likely an overstatement. While it is possible that this government has taken significant steps to prioritize gender equality, claiming uniqueness without comprehensive evidence is problematic.

2. **Mainly referring to the City Transport Company**: This specifies that the claim is primarily about one company, which adds some specificity to the claim.

1. **Context of the Claim**: The phrase ""brilliant victory"" is subjective and can refer to various aspects of political success, such as gaining significant seats in parliament, achieving unexpected results, or impacting political discourse.

2. **Factual Basis**: To determine the accuracy, we need to compare the vote counts of Ryszard Petru's party and the United Left.

Without specific data on the vote counts, we cannot definitively verify the claim.

1. **Current Revenue (27 million euros):** If there is verifiable data that confirms Aerodrom currently brings in 27 million euros, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Historical Profits:**
   - The president initially claimed profits were 130,000 euros.
   - The claim then states the president realized this was not true and that the profits were never less than 16-17 million euros.

For the overall claim to be evaluated accurately, we need to know:
- Whether the current revenue is indeed 27 million euros.
- Whether the president initially claimed profits of 130,000 euros.
- Whether the president corrected this to state that profits were never less than 16-17 million euros.

Without specific verification, the claim mixes elements that could be true, partially true, or false. The correction by the president suggests some acknowledgment of inaccuracy, but the exact figures need verification.

These criteria are not vague but rather specific and standardized.

2. **Objective Measures**: While psychiatry does rely on clinical manifestations and sometimes laboratory data, the removal of such criteria is not standard practice and would be highly controversial if implemented.

3. **Potential for Abuse**: The claim that psychiatry could be used for punitive purposes is a serious allegation. Historically, there have been instances of the misuse of psychiatry, but modern ethical guidelines and professional standards are designed to prevent such abuses.

Under Stalin, the situation was more complex. Initially, after the Bolshevik Revolution, abortion was legalized in 1920. However, in 1936, Stalin's regime banned abortion as part of a broader set of policies aimed at increasing the birth rate and strengthening the family unit.

1. **Identify the Loss in 2009**: Determine the nature and magnitude of the economic loss Serbia experienced in 2009. This could be due to factors like the global financial crisis.

2. **Analyze Export Growth**: Look at Serbia's export data from 2009 onwards to see if there has been significant growth that could compensate for the loss in 2009.

3. **Compare Export Growth to the Loss**: Assess whether the cumulative export growth from 2009 to the previous year (assuming the claim is being made in a specific year) is sufficient to make up for the loss in 2009.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general economic trends, Serbia's exports have shown growth over the years, but whether this growth fully compensated for a specific loss in 2009 would require detailed analysis.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific data in the prompt, a reasonable assessment would be:

**Final Answer: Mostly True**

This assessment assumes that while Serbia's exports have grown, fully making up for a specific loss in 2009 is a more nuanced claim that would require detailed economic analysis.",mostly true,True,False

The statement suggests that the speaker has discussed matters with all coalition partners and that the focus is on essential changes in the government rather than personal ones. Without additional context or evidence to verify the speaker's interactions and the nature of the discussions, it is difficult to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim.

However, based on the statement alone, it implies that the speaker is asserting a broad consensus or agreement among coalition partners regarding the need for essential changes. If we assume the speaker is truthful about having conducted these conversations and the focus of them, the claim could be considered mostly true, as it reflects the speaker's perspective and reported interactions.

„Kreditni rejting je snižen zahvaljujući lošem radu u javnim finansijama prethodne Vlade.“,half true,sr,"""The credit rating has been lowered due to the poor performance in public finances of the previous government.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Credit Rating**: Credit ratings are assigned by agencies like Moody's, S&P, and Fitch based on a country's ability and willingness to repay its debts.
2. **Public Finances**: This refers to the government's revenue, expenditure, and debt management.
3. **Previous Government's Performance**: The claim attributes the cause of the rating downgrade to the previous government's management of public finances.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively say whether the claim is entirely true or false. However, credit rating agencies often cite fiscal performance as a reason for rating changes. Therefore, if a rating agency has explicitly mentioned poor fiscal management by the previous government as a reason for the downgrade, the claim could be considered mostly true. If the downgrade was due to other factors or a combination of factors, the claim might be less accurate.

Given the typical reasons for credit rating changes and the specificity of the claim, a reasonable assessment without additional context might be:

Without additional information, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume the claim is based on a statement made by the prosecution, we can assess its plausibility.

**Analysis:**
1. **Claim Source:** If the claim comes directly from the prosecution, it is likely true from their perspective.
2. **Context:** Prosecutors often make such statements to convey the outcome of negotiations or agreements.
3. **Evidence:** Without specific details about the agreement or the prosecution's internal assessments, we rely on the credibility of the prosecution's statement.

Given that the claim is a direct quote from the prosecution, it is reasonable to assume it reflects their viewpoint accurately.

1. **Stabilizing the Country and Defending from Bankruptcy**: This is a broad statement that would require specific economic indicators to verify. Without context or data, it's challenging to determine its accuracy.

2. **Arrival of a Large Number of Foreign Investments**: This claim suggests that there has been significant foreign investment. To verify, one would need data on foreign direct investment (FDI) over the past two years.

3. **Opening More Than 120 Thousand New Jobs**: This is a specific and measurable claim. To verify, one would need reliable data on job creation over the past two years.

Given the lack of specific data or context provided, it's difficult to fully verify the claim. However, the claim does include a specific and potentially verifiable component (the job creation number), which lends some credibility. Still, the overall claim is quite broad and lacks concrete evidence.

2. **State Authorities' Engagement**: Whether there is evidence that state authorities did not seriously engage with the case during this period.

Without specific evidence or context, it is difficult to definitively assess the claim. However, if the claim is supported by reliable sources or official reports indicating a lack of progress and minimal engagement by state authorities, it would lean towards being true. If there is mixed evidence or some progress was made but not significant, it could be considered ""Mostly True"" or ""Half True.""

While it is true that Sweden imports waste to fuel its waste-to-energy program, it does not mean that the country has completely run out of its own garbage. The country has a highly efficient recycling system and uses waste to generate heat and electricity, but it still produces waste. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but also not completely true.

1. **Kazakhstan**: According to various sources, including the World Bank and national statistics agencies, the share of expenditure on food in Kazakhstan can indeed be quite high, often around 40-50% for a significant portion of the population. This aligns with the claim that almost half of the budget for nearly 50% of citizens goes to food.

2. **Russia**: In Russia, the share of food expenditure is generally lower than in Kazakhstan but still higher than in developed countries. It typically ranges around 30-40%. This supports the claim that the situation in Kazakhstan is ""much worse"" than in Russia.

3. **Developed Countries**: In developed countries, the share of expenditure on food is indeed much lower, often around 10-12%, as stated in the claim.

Given these points, the claim appears to be largely accurate, although specific percentages can vary slightly based on different sources and methodologies.

1. The financial turnaround of municipal public utility companies from a loss of two billion dinars in 2013 to a profit of two billion dinars.
2. The assertion that 85 percent of that profit goes into the City of Belgrade's budget.
3. The use of this budget for infrastructure projects, school construction, kindergartens, and playgrounds.

Without access to specific financial records, audits, or reports from the municipal public utility companies and the City of Belgrade's budget, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim.

США скупили 90% запаса препарата «Ремдесивир»,true,ru,'The USA has bought up 90% of the supply of the drug Remdesivir'.,"The claim that ""The USA has bought up 90% of the supply of the drug Remdesivir"" is a complex one and requires nuanced analysis.

In July 2020, the U.S. government secured a large portion of the global supply of Remdesivir from Gilead Sciences, the drug's manufacturer. However, the exact percentage of the global supply that the U.S. purchased was not definitively 90%. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that it had secured more than 500,000 treatment courses of Remdesivir, which represented the vast majority of Gilead's projected production for July, August, and September 2020.

While this purchase did significantly impact the global supply, it is not accurate to say that the U.S. bought up 90% of the supply. The claim overstates the percentage and does not account for the entire production period beyond the initial months.

1. **Source Verification**: The claim should be checked against official sources such as government reports, statistical agencies, or reputable news outlets.

2. **Data Accuracy**: Both the number of pensioners (366,000) and the total debt amount (5.7 billion PLN) need to be verified for accuracy.

3. **Context**: The claim should be considered in the context of the time it was made. Debt figures and the number of pensioners can change over time.

Serbia did begin its vaccination campaign in late December 2020, which was relatively early compared to many other countries outside the EU. However, it is essential to verify whether Serbia was indeed among the first three non-EU countries to start vaccinations.

Given the available information, Serbia was one of the earlier countries outside the EU to begin vaccinations, but determining if it was among the first three requires specific data that may not be readily accessible. Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but not definitively proven as the top three.

1. Konrad Piasecki claims that Marshal Stanisław Tyszka is anti-PiS (Law and Justice party) in his radicalism.
2. Adam Szłapka expresses skepticism about this claim, noting that Stanisław Tyszka is a close advisor to Jarosław Gowin and a member of the board of the Poland Together party, which is led by Jarosław Gowin.

The context suggests that Poland Together has been affiliated with the United Right coalition, which includes the PiS party. Therefore, if Stanisław Tyszka is a close advisor to Jarosław Gowin and a member of the Poland Together party, it is unlikely that he would be anti-PiS, given the coalition dynamics.

Given this context, Adam Szłapka's skepticism seems justified, as it aligns with the political affiliations and alliances.

Феминитивы необходимы языку и обществу,true,ru,Feminine forms of words are necessary for language and society.,"The necessity of feminine forms of words can vary greatly depending on the language and cultural context. In some languages, gender is a fundamental part of grammar, and having feminine forms is linguistically necessary for correct usage. However, in other languages, gender-neutral terms are increasingly used to promote inclusivity, suggesting that feminine forms might not always be strictly necessary. Societally, the use of feminine forms can contribute to visibility and representation, but it is also important to consider the evolving nature of language and the push for more inclusive terminology.

Given these complexities, the claim that ""Feminine forms of words are necessary for language and society"" is not entirely true but holds significant validity in many contexts. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

Wawel is a significant historical site in Krakow, Poland, and it has been the venue for various important speeches and events.

George W. Bush did indeed speak at Wawel Castle during his presidency. However, the claim that he is the only person to have done so is likely inaccurate. Wawel Castle has a rich history and has hosted numerous dignitaries, political leaders, and other notable figures who have given speeches there.

Without specific evidence that no other person has spoken at Wawel, it is not reasonable to assert that George W. Bush is the only one. Therefore, the claim is likely an exaggeration.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Serbia has not joined the European Union. Negotiations for Serbia's accession are ongoing, and several key chapters of the accession process remain open. The claim that Serbia would certainly be part of the EU by 2020 did not materialize.

1. **Aging Population**: Like many countries, Serbia is experiencing an aging population due to declining birth rates and increased life expectancy. This means the number of pensioners is indeed expected to increase in the coming years.

2. **Job Creation**: The rate of job creation depends on various economic factors. Serbia has been working on economic reforms, but job growth can lag behind the increase in the number of pensioners due to factors like slow economic growth, lack of investment, or mismatches in the labor market.

Given these points, the claim seems to be generally accurate, but it might oversimplify complex economic and demographic issues. It's important to note that the claim does not account for potential policy changes or economic developments that could alter these trends.

1. **Largest Inflow of Investments**: This is a factual claim that can be verified with economic data. If the data shows that the highest inflow of investments did indeed occur during the DSS government, then this part of the claim is true.

2. **Average Salary**: This is also a factual claim that can be verified with historical salary data. If the average salary during the DSS government was a hundred euros higher than it is today, then this part of the claim is true.

Without specific data to verify these claims, we can't definitively say whether the statement is true or false.

2. The claim further states that now 62.2% of the PIO Fund goes towards pension payments.
3. Additionally, it claims that only 37.8% comes from the budget.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify the exact percentages. However, the claim presents a clear comparison and transition in the allocation of the PIO Fund towards pension payments.

Given the information provided:

- The increase from 51.1% to 62.2% for pension payments is a notable change.
- The statement that 37.8% comes from the budget is a complement to the 62.2% pension allocation, suggesting a shift in funding sources.

Auxiliary workers in public enterprises might include janitors, maintenance staff, administrative assistants, and other support personnel. Their salaries are generally lower than those of healthcare professionals.

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many European countries implemented border controls and closures to mitigate the spread of the virus. Poland was indeed among the first countries to take such measures, announcing border closures in mid-March 2020. However, other countries such as Italy and Denmark also implemented strict border controls around the same time.

Given this context, the claim that Poland was the ""first"" to close its borders is not entirely accurate, as other countries took similar actions within a very close time frame.

""This part of the world"" is likely referring to Europe or a similar geographic region. As of recent data, gas prices can vary significantly among European countries due to factors like taxes, market conditions, and supply chains. Countries like Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands often have high gas prices due to high taxes and environmental policies.

Without specific, up-to-date data, it is challenging to definitively conclude whether Poles pay the most for gas. However, based on general trends and available data, it is unlikely that Poland consistently has the highest gas prices in Europe or its broader region.

Assuming a typical annual birth rate for a country (let's use Poland as an example, since the Family 500 plus program is a Polish initiative), the number of births is usually in the hundreds of thousands. For instance, if the annual birth rate is around 400,000 children, an increase of 20,000 to 30,000 would indeed be around 5% to 7.5%, which is less than a 10% increase.

Given this context, the claim seems generally accurate, although it depends on the specific annual birth rate figures.

The capacity of these supplies has greatly increased. Initially, it was 8.5 billion m3 of gas, today it is already a total of 23 billion to date.""","To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. The claim states that the supply of liquefied gas to Poland through the LNG terminal in Świnoujście has increased.
2. It specifies that the capacity initially was 8.5 billion m3 of gas and has now increased to a total of 23 billion m3.

To determine the accuracy of this claim, we need to verify:
- Whether the initial capacity was indeed 8.5 billion m3.
- Whether the current capacity is 23 billion m3.

Without specific data or sources to verify these numbers, it's challenging to confirm the exact figures. However, it is known that the Świnoujście LNG terminal has been expanding its capacity over time. The initial capacity of the terminal was indeed around 5 billion m3 per year, but with expansions and additional infrastructure, the capacity has been increasing.

Given the general trend of increasing capacity and the plausibility of the numbers provided, the claim seems mostly accurate but might not be precisely correct in terms of the exact figures.

If the claim was made in or around the year 2016, then it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True' because a car produced in 2016 would be new at that time. However, if the claim was made significantly later, such as in 2023, then the car would no longer be new, making the claim 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without the specific context of when the claim was made, it's challenging to assign a definitive truth value. However, if we assume the claim was made in or around 2016, it would be reasonable to consider it 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

Eurostat provides comparative price levels for consumer goods and services, which can help determine the affordability of living in various countries. In 2009, Eurostat data indicated that Serbia had relatively low prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages compared to many other European countries. Additionally, the overall cost of living in Serbia was generally lower than in many other European nations.

Given this context, the claim that Serbia was ranked among the countries with the lowest prices for food and drinks, as well as among the most affordable to live in, is largely accurate. While specific rankings can vary based on the exact metrics and comparisons used, the general statement aligns with the available data.

1. **Timeline of the Project**: We need to verify when the project started and whether it has been ongoing for 8 years.
2. **Involvement of the Civic Platform**: We need to confirm that the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) has been directly involved in the development of the gas port.

Without specific details and sources, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, based on general knowledge and typical practices, political claims often involve some degree of truth but may also include exaggerations or misrepresentations.

If the Civic Platform has indeed been involved in the project for a significant portion of the 8 years, the claim might be considered ""Mostly True."" If the involvement has been less significant or the timeline is not entirely accurate, the claim might be ""Half True.""

2. **Cross-Reference Data**: Compare the figures from multiple reliable sources to ensure consistency.

Given the lack of immediate access to these databases, we'll proceed under the assumption that the figures provided in the claim are based on reputable sources.

I remind you that eleven national parliaments gave the European Commission a yellow card on this issue.'","To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **""There is this matter of posted workers, which is fundamental from the perspective of Polish interests.""** This is a subjective statement about the importance of the posted workers issue to Poland, and it's widely known that Poland has had significant interest in this topic due to the large number of Polish workers posted to other EU countries. So, this part of the statement can be considered true.

2. **""I remind you that eleven national parliaments gave the European Commission a yellow card on this issue.""** This refers to a specific procedural step in the EU where national parliaments can express their concern about a legislative proposal (a ""yellow card""). To verify this, we would need to check if indeed eleven national parliaments issued a yellow card on the posted workers issue.

Historically, the yellow card procedure has been used sparingly, and verifying the exact number of parliaments that issued a yellow card on the posted workers directive requires specific historical data. However, it is known that the posted workers directive has been a contentious issue in the EU, with several countries expressing concerns.

Given the specificity of the claim about eleven national parliaments, without exact data, it's challenging to definitively say it's entirely true or false. However, the general context of significant concern and opposition from multiple national parliaments is accurate.

2. **""Therefore, it could not have been contested.""** - Logically, if no permit was issued, then it follows that it could not have been contested. This part is also true if the first part is true.

3. **""What the court dealt with were preparatory works related to archaeological investigations.""** - This part is independent of the first two and could be true or false regardless of the status of the permit. If the court indeed dealt with preparatory works related to archaeological investigations, then this part is true.

Some sectors within the industry are recovering more quickly than others, and certain areas are still facing significant challenges.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Heparin and SARS-COV-2**: Some studies have suggested that heparin, a blood thinner, might have antiviral properties and could potentially interfere with the SARS-COV-2 virus's ability to infect cells. This is primarily due to heparin's ability to bind to the spike protein of the virus.

2. **Source of Heparin**: Heparin is typically derived from animal sources, such as pig intestines or bovine lungs. While there is research on extracting heparin-like compounds from seaweed, this is not a common or widely used source of heparin.

3. **Comparison with Remdesivir**: Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that has shown some efficacy in treating COVID-19. Comparing heparin's efficacy directly to Remdesivir is challenging because they work through different mechanisms and are used for different purposes in COVID-19 treatment.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also some misleading or unproven statements.

In many presidential systems, the President often plays a significant role in foreign policy, while the government (or cabinet) may implement or support those policies. However, without specific context about which country this refers to, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.

In general, in presidential systems, the President often has significant authority over foreign policy, while the cabinet or government may play a more supportive role. This dynamic can vary widely depending on the specific political system and traditions of the country in question.

Given this general understanding, the claim that the Government does not lead foreign policy but is a subservient activity of the President's cabinet is mostly accurate in many presidential systems.

Without specific data, I can provide a general approach to evaluating such a claim:

1. **Fuel Prices in Serbia**: Determine the current price of fuel in Serbia.
2. **Fuel Prices in Croatia**: Compare the price of fuel in Croatia.
3. **Fuel Prices in Slovenia**: Compare the price of fuel in Slovenia.
4. **Fuel Prices in Italy**: Compare the price of fuel in Italy.

Generally, fuel prices can vary due to factors like taxes, subsidies, and market conditions. If the claimant has recent and accurate data showing that fuel prices in Serbia are lower than in the other mentioned countries, the claim could be true. However, without specific data, we cannot definitively verify the claim.

The claim states that an agreement will result in more favorable delivery terms for Russian gas to Serbia and a lower price of at least 12 percent, with the possibility of an additional discount.

Without specific details or external verification, it's challenging to determine the absolute truth of this statement. However, based on the information given, the claim suggests a potential outcome rather than a definitive one. The use of phrases like ""it is possible"" indicates that the additional discount is not guaranteed, which makes the claim partially speculative.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the additional discount, the claim can be considered mostly true because it accurately states the potential for more favorable terms and a lower price but includes a speculative element regarding the additional discount.

"У двух китайских врачей, заболевших коронавирусом изменился цвет лица",true,ru,'The facial color of two Chinese doctors who contracted the coronavirus has changed'.,"To evaluate the claim ""The facial color of two Chinese doctors who contracted the coronavirus has changed,"" we need to consider the context and available evidence. Changes in facial color can be a symptom of various health conditions, including severe COVID-19 cases, which can affect oxygen levels in the blood and lead to changes in skin color.

However, without specific details or medical reports confirming this claim for the two Chinese doctors in question, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. The claim could be true if it refers to documented cases where doctors experienced such symptoms, but it could also be false or misleading if it is not based on verified medical information.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, the most reasonable assessment is that it is a general statement that could have some truth but is not definitively proven.

1. **Current Composition of Ministers**: Let's say the current cabinet has 25 ministers.
2. **Government from 2000**: Let's say the government in 2000 had 24 ministers.
3. **Government Before 2000**: Let's say the government before 2000 had 23 ministers.

If the current cabinet has 25 ministers and the governments from 2000 and before had 24 and 23 ministers respectively, then the claim that the current cabinet is not bloated compared to previous years is mostly accurate, although there is a slight increase.

Given this hypothetical data, the claim would be considered mostly true because while there is a slight increase, it is not significant enough to label the current cabinet as bloated compared to previous years.

As of my last update in October 2023, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are indeed significant trading partners within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The volume of trade between these two countries has been growing, and recent reports suggest that the trade volume has been substantial.

According to various economic reports and trade statistics, the trade volume between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan has been increasing and has surpassed the $2 billion mark in recent years. While the exact figure of $2.7 billion for the end of last year would need verification from the most recent official trade statistics, the general trend supports the claim that the trade volume is significant and likely in the range mentioned.

1. **Resumption of Flights**: If it is true that flights from Serbia to the USA have resumed after a 25-year period, this part of the claim is accurate.
2. **Mutual Trust and Growth**: The claim that this resumption speaks to greater mutual trust and the growth of Serbia's national airline and airports is subjective but plausible. These factors often play a role in international aviation agreements.
3. **Security Conditions**: Improved security conditions in Serbia could indeed be a factor in allowing flights to the USA. This part of the claim is also plausible.

Given that the claim acknowledges that there is an ecological tax, but argues that it is only a few percent, it suggests that the impact on prices is minor compared to the 20% increase mentioned.

While it is true that drug addiction can have a ripple effect on family, friends, and communities, the specific numbers cited (5 to 17 people) would need to be supported by reliable, peer-reviewed studies. Without such specific data, it is challenging to verify the exact range provided in the claim.

Various studies have shown that drug addiction can affect multiple people, including family members, peers, and community members, but the precise number can vary widely depending on the context, type of drug, and other factors.

In many countries, including Poland and France, school closures were part of the initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The specific number of cases at the time of closure can vary, but the figures mentioned (30 cases in Poland and 2000 cases in France) are plausible given the different approaches countries took based on their assessment of the situation.

Here are the steps to assess the claim:

1. **Political Context**: Understand the current distribution of seats or political influence among the coalition, Democrats, and Progressives.
2. **Majority Requirements**: Determine if the Democrats and Progressives together can form a majority without the coalition.
3. **Alternative Scenarios**: Consider if there are other potential coalitions or political alignments that could form a government.

The claim suggests that the coalition is essential unless the Democrats and Progressives can form a majority on their own. If this is the only scenario where a government can be formed without the coalition, then the claim is likely accurate.

However, if there are other potential coalitions or if the Democrats and Progressives cannot form a majority, the claim would be less accurate.

1. **True**: If Tusk explicitly stated in a public speech in 2011 that he would not kneel before the bishops and would liquidate the church fund, and these statements are well-documented and verified by multiple reliable sources.

2. **Mostly True**: If the essence of Tusk's statements matches the claim but there are minor discrepancies or the context is slightly different.

3. **Half True**: If Tusk made similar statements but they were significantly altered, taken out of context, or if only part of the claim is accurate.

4. **Mostly False**: If the statements attributed to Tusk are largely inaccurate or misrepresented, with only minor elements being true.

5. **False**: If there is no record of Tusk making such statements, or if the statements are entirely fabricated.

1. **Wealth Status of Vojvodina**: Vojvodina is generally considered one of the wealthier regions in Serbia.
2. **Social Welfare Recipients**: The claim suggests that Vojvodina has the highest number of social welfare recipients.
3. **Disgrace and Pride**: The subjective aspects of the claim (disgrace and pride) are harder to quantify but are integral to the tone of the statement.

1. **Comparison with Germany**: The claim states that Germany operates exceptionally and is not comparable. Germany is known for its fiscal discipline and often operates with a lower deficit compared to many other EU countries.

2. **Comparison with France**: The claim mentions that France has a deficit two and a half times larger than Serbia's. This specific comparison would need to be verified with actual data, but it is plausible given that France often has a higher deficit relative to many other EU countries.

3. **General Deficit Comparison**: The claim that Serbia's deficit is drastically lower than the deficits of the most significant EU countries (except Germany) needs to be contextualized with actual deficit figures. If the data supports that Serbia's deficit is indeed much lower than the deficits of major EU countries like France, Italy, or Spain, then the claim holds some truth.

Predictions can be based on various factors, including current trends, economic policies, and expert analyses, but they are not guarantees.

1. **Context and Data**: Look for official reports, government documents, or news articles that detail changes in family benefits during the 8-year period of Platforma's governance.

2. **Accuracy**: Verify if the cumulative increase in family benefits over the 8 years amounts to exactly 9 zlotys.

3. **Interpretation**: If the increase is precisely 9 zlotys, the claim is true. If the increase is close to 9 zlotys but not exactly, it might be mostly true. If the increase significantly deviates from 9 zlotys, it could be half true, mostly false, or false.

Since I don't have access to the specific data, I'll assume a hypothetical scenario where the actual increase is known.

**Hypothetical Scenario**:
- If the actual increase in family benefits over the 8 years is found to be 9 zlotys, the claim is 'True'.
- If the actual increase is around 9 zlotys (e.g., 8 or 10 zlotys), the claim is 'Mostly True'.

2. **Context and Interpretation**: The claim also asserts that ""we have never given more money for domestic cinema."" This statement implies a continuous and unprecedented level of funding, which could be true if the budget has been increasing consistently and is at its highest point.

However, without specific data or context provided in the question, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. Generally, claims about future savings from policy changes are often subject to uncertainty and depend on various assumptions about the effectiveness of the reforms, economic conditions, and other factors.

2. **Poland**: The claim states that there is a twenty-fold increase in beer consumption and a decrease in the production of hops.

Without specific data to verify these claims, we can analyze the logical consistency and general trends.

1. **Germany**: It is generally logical that an increase in beer consumption would drive the production of hops, as hops are a key ingredient in beer. This part of the claim seems plausible.

2. **Poland**: A twenty-fold increase in beer consumption would typically imply a significant increase in demand for ingredients like hops. However, a decrease in the production of hops seems counterintuitive unless there are other factors at play, such as importing hops from other countries or a shift in brewing methods that reduce the need for hops.

Given the logical inconsistency in the Polish part of the claim, it is difficult to accept it as fully true without additional context or data. Therefore, the overall claim seems to be a mix of plausible and implausible points.

1. **""We are in the seventh year of a seven-year perspective, and we have disbursed less than 46%, with only 27 billion out of 60 billion reaching farmers' accounts.""**

2. **""In the area of farm modernization, it's even worse, with less than 1/3 completed.""**

Without specific data to verify these claims, we can analyze the logical consistency and plausibility of the statement:

- The claim specifies exact percentages and amounts, which suggests a level of precision and potentially verifiable data.
- The statement acknowledges a significant shortfall in both disbursement and achievement, which is consistent with a critical assessment of the program's progress.

Given the specificity and the consistent narrative of underperformance, the claim appears plausible but would require verification with actual data to confirm its accuracy.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, we can analyze it based on typical economic indicators and trends.

1. **Import Coverage by Exports at 58 Percent**: This means that exports are covering 58 percent of the value of imports. Whether this is ""insufficient"" depends on the context and the economic goals of the country. Generally, a ratio below 100 percent indicates a trade deficit, which many countries consider insufficient for balanced trade.

2. **Highest Level in This Era**: Without historical data, it's hard to verify if 58 percent is indeed the highest level Serbia has had. However, if we assume that the statement is based on accurate historical data, it could be true.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim seems plausible but not definitively provable without further context. Therefore, it is reasonable to categorize it as ""Mostly True"" based on the assumption that the historical context is accurate and that a 58 percent import coverage is considered insufficient by typical economic standards.

1. **True**: If every single event in 2015 received more funding than its counterpart in 2013, the claim would be true.
2. **Mostly True**: If the vast majority of events in 2015 received more funding compared to 2013, but there were a few exceptions, the claim would be mostly true.

1. **Composition of the HJC**: The legitimacy of the HJC's work depends on its composition as defined by law. If the HJC is operating with an incomplete composition, it may affect its ability to perform certain functions legally.

2. **Legal Requirements**: The laws and regulations governing the HJC would specify whether an incomplete composition invalidates its decisions or renders its work illegitimate.

3. **Jurisdictional Context**: The context and specific circumstances under which the HJC is operating would also be relevant. If there are emergency provisions or temporary measures in place, these could affect the legitimacy of the HJC's work.

Without specific details about the legal framework and the current composition of the HJC, it is challenging to definitively classify the claim.

Over time, as the economic situation stabilizes and improvements are made in the home country, emigration levels may decrease or stabilize.

Without specific data for the country in question, it is difficult to definitively say whether the claim is universally true.

The rest is lost during the stages of energy conversion, transportation, and consumption.'","To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into two main parts:

1. **Poland's Economy is Almost Twice as Energy-Intensive as the European Average:**
   - Energy intensity is typically measured as the amount of energy required to produce a unit of GDP. According to various reports and data sources, Poland does have a higher energy intensity compared to the European average, but whether it is ""almost twice"" needs specific data for verification.

2. **Out of 100 Units of Primary Energy, Only a Few Dozen are Efficiently Used:**
   - This part of the claim suggests significant energy losses during conversion, transportation, and consumption. Generally, energy systems do have losses at various stages, but the specific numbers can vary widely depending on the technology and infrastructure in use.

Without specific data to verify the exact figures, the claim seems plausible based on general trends and comparisons, but it might be an overstatement to say that only a few dozen units are efficiently used.

VAERS is a passive surveillance system that allows individuals to report adverse events following vaccination, but it's important to note that reports to VAERS do not necessarily prove causality.

Here's a breakdown based on available data:

1. **Disability**: Reports of disability following HPV vaccination are relatively rare. The number of reports that specifically indicate disability is likely lower than 3000, as this term is not frequently used in VAERS reports.

2. **Deaths**: The number of deaths reported to VAERS after HPV vaccination is indeed in the range of several hundred, but it's important to note that these deaths are not necessarily caused by the vaccine. Many reported deaths occur due to unrelated causes.

3. **Cervical Dysplasia and Cervical Cancer**: These conditions are not typically associated with the HPV vaccine as adverse events. Instead, the HPV vaccine is designed to prevent these conditions. Reports of cervical dysplasia or cancer after vaccination are more likely coincidental and not caused by the vaccine.

Given these points, the claim exaggerates the number of disabilities and misattributes cervical dysplasia and cancer as adverse events caused by the vaccine. While there have been deaths reported after HPV vaccination, the claim lacks context regarding causality.

1. **Historical Alliance**: Poland and Israel have had a complex relationship, but there have been periods of alliance and cooperation, particularly in terms of historical ties and shared experiences.

2. **UN Security Council Voting**: To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to look at specific instances where Poland abstained from voting in the UN Security Council in a way that supported Israel. Generally, abstaining from a vote can be seen as a form of tacit support, but it depends on the context and the specific resolutions in question.

Given the general context and the complexity of international relations, the claim that Poland has been an ally of Israel and has abstained from voting in the UN Security Council in a way that supports Israel is likely to be **Mostly True**.

As of the latest available data, Serbia has indeed made significant strides in increasing the number of girls and women in the ICT sector. According to various reports and studies, Serbia has one of the highest percentages of women in ICT in Europe, with some estimates suggesting that around 30-35% of ICT professionals in Serbia are women.

However, stating that it will take decades for European Union countries to catch up with Serbia is a more complex claim. The EU has also been actively promoting gender equality in the ICT sector, and progress is being made, albeit at varying rates across different member states. While Serbia's current position is notable, the future trajectory of gender equality in the ICT sector across Europe is influenced by numerous factors, including policy initiatives, educational programs, and cultural changes, which are difficult to predict with certainty.

Given the current data and the ongoing efforts in the EU, the claim that Serbia is a leader in the number of girls in the ICT sector is mostly accurate, but the assertion that it will take decades for EU countries to catch up is more speculative and less certain.

1. The speaker admits to not handling politics well and not knowing how to respond to accusations. This part of the claim is subjective and relies on the speaker's self-assessment.
2. The speaker claims that no one told them they were running the city badly, no tenders were rigged, or wrong investments were made. This part of the claim involves facts that can be verified or disputed by others.

Without external verification or context, it's challenging to definitively label the entire claim as true or false.

Vaccines are rigorously tested for safety and efficacy, and serious adverse events, including death, are extremely rare. In contrast, measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to serious complications, including death, especially in young children and immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, the risk of dying from measles is significantly higher than the risk associated with vaccination.

1. **""We must remember that this anti-smog law will largely eliminate the possibility of heating with coal stoves.""** This part of the claim suggests that the anti-smog law aims to significantly reduce or eliminate the use of coal stoves for heating. This is likely true, as many anti-smog laws are designed to reduce pollution from sources like coal stoves.

2. **""In a situation where 70% of people in southern Poland heat their homes this way.""** This part of the claim provides a specific statistic about the prevalence of coal stove heating in southern Poland. The accuracy of this statistic is crucial for evaluating the overall truthfulness of the claim.

Without specific data to verify the 70% figure, we can consider the general trend and available information. It is known that coal stoves are widely used in Poland, particularly in rural areas and regions with less access to modern heating systems. However, the exact percentage can vary.

Given the context, it's plausible that a significant portion of people in southern Poland use coal stoves for heating, but the specific figure of 70% may be an overestimation. Therefore, the claim is likely exaggerated but contains some elements of truth.

Historically, governments have grown in size and complexity over time, particularly in developed nations. For example, the United States government has expanded significantly in terms of both budget and personnel since its inception. However, without specific data comparing all governments throughout history, it's challenging to definitively claim that any one government is the ""largest"" ever.

2. **Report on Rigged Tenders in Poland**: The claim states that OLAF reported that one in four tenders in Poland is rigged. This is a specific and quantifiable assertion.

However, without direct access to the specific OLAF report cited, it is challenging to verify the exact figures. Publicly available OLAF reports often highlight investigations and provide general statistics on fraud and corruption, but they may not always specify such precise ratios for individual countries.

1. **Increase in Jobs**: An increase of 46 thousand jobs over a five-year period in the manufacturing industry could be plausible, but it depends on the initial number of jobs and the economic context.

2. **Average Salary Decrease**: A 25% decrease in average salary in dollar terms over a five-year period is possible, especially if there were significant economic downturns, currency devaluations, or other adverse economic conditions.

1. **Imported carpets in Uzbekistan are subject to excise tax.**
2. **Uzbek producers (of exported carpets) have the right to a VAT refund.**

### Part 1: Imported carpets in Uzbekistan are subject to excise tax.
Excise tax typically applies to specific goods such as alcohol, tobacco, and fuel. Carpets are not a common category for excise tax. Generally, imported goods, including carpets, are subject to customs duties and possibly value-added tax (VAT), but not excise tax.

### Part 2: Uzbek producers (of exported carpets) have the right to a VAT refund.
VAT refunds for exported goods are a common practice in many countries to encourage exports. This means that when goods are exported, the VAT paid on the production of those goods can be refunded to the exporter.

### Analysis:
- **Part 1** is likely false because carpets are not typically subject to excise tax.
- **Part 2** is likely true because VAT refunds for exported goods are a common international practice.

Given that one part is false and the other part is true, the claim is partially accurate.

1. Whether the government promised three years ago to reduce taxes and parafiscal levies.
2. Whether the number of taxes and parafiscal levies was 360 three years ago.
3. Whether the current number of taxes and parafiscal levies is 384.
4. Whether the adoption of the Law on Private Security will introduce a new tax, making it the 385th tax.

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, we cannot definitively conclude the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and the lack of verifiable data, we can make a reasoned judgment.

The claim suggests that the government failed to keep its promise and that the number of taxes has increased. If the numbers provided (360 to 384) are accurate, and if the new law indeed introduces another tax, the claim would be mostly true. However, without verifying the exact numbers and the impact of the new law, we cannot be certain.

If the interest rate on dinar savings is indeed much higher than the rate of inflation, then saving in dinars would provide a real return on investment, meaning the value of the savings would increase over time after accounting for inflation.

However, without specific data on the current interest rates for dinar savings and the rate of inflation, it is not possible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false.

However, without additional information, I can provide a general assessment based on typical practices and ethical considerations in mental health and education.

1. **Psychological Diagnosis and Treatment in Schools**: It is not uncommon for schools to have programs that involve psychological assessments and interventions. These programs are typically aimed at identifying and addressing learning difficulties, emotional issues, and behavioral problems that can impact a child's education and well-being.

2. **Mass Diagnosis Concerns**: The claim suggests that this could lead to the mass diagnosis of children with mental disorders. While it is true that some programs may increase the identification of mental health issues, ethical guidelines and professional standards generally require that diagnoses are made with caution and based on thorough assessments.

3. **Ethical Considerations**: Professional organizations such as the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) have guidelines to ensure that mental health diagnoses are made responsibly and that interventions are evidence-based and appropriate for the individual child.

Given these points, the claim is partially accurate because psychological diagnosis and treatment programs do exist in schools, but the concern about ""mass diagnosis"" may be overstated without specific evidence. Therefore, the claim is best categorized as:

1. **Prevalence of Cancer in Poland**:
   - According to various health organizations and statistical data, the number of cancer cases in Poland is significant but does not reach 1 million active cases. For instance, as of recent data, the number of new cancer cases diagnosed annually is around 180,000, and the total number of people living with cancer is lower than 1 million.

2. **Budget for Oncological Treatment**:
   - The budget for oncological treatment in Poland is indeed a matter of public concern, but specific figures can vary. However, 1.5 billion PLN (Polish Złoty) is likely an underestimation for the total budget allocated for oncological treatment when considering all sources, including public and private funding.

Without specific details about the ruling, the context, and the actual decision of the Constitutional Tribunal, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of each component. However, the phrase ""No Faggots"" is highly controversial and unlikely to be part of an official ruling by a constitutional court. Additionally, the Celtic cross is often associated with neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups, which would make its registration controversial and likely subject to legal scrutiny.

Given the lack of specific evidence and the controversial nature of the symbols and phrases mentioned, the claim appears to be a mix of potentially true elements (a ruling in 2011) and highly doubtful elements (""No Faggots"" being part of the ruling).

„Srbija je danas dalja od EU nego što je bila pre dve godine.“,false,sr,"""Serbia is today farther from the EU than it was two years ago.""","To evaluate the claim that ""Serbia is today farther from the EU than it was two years ago,"" we need to consider the progress or lack thereof in Serbia's EU accession process. This includes factors such as political reforms, economic integration, and alignment with EU policies and values.

As of my last update in 2023, Serbia has been in the process of negotiating its EU accession since 2014. The pace of these negotiations has been influenced by various factors, including the country's internal political situation, its relations with neighboring countries (particularly Kosovo), and its alignment with EU standards and requirements.

While there have been some advancements, Serbia has also faced significant challenges and setbacks, such as delays in implementing necessary reforms and ongoing issues related to the rule of law, media freedom, and corruption. These challenges have led to concerns within the EU about Serbia's readiness to join the bloc.

Given the complex and somewhat stagnant nature of the accession process, it is reasonable to argue that Serbia has not made substantial progress over the past two years. Therefore, the claim that Serbia is today farther from the EU than it was two years ago can be seen as having some validity, but it is not entirely accurate without further context and specific data.

- **Votes Received**: It is less common for a candidate or party to receive more votes in each successive election, as political support can fluctuate. This part of the claim requires detailed electoral data to verify.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim can be considered plausible but not definitively true. Therefore, a balanced approach would be to classify it as 'Half True' until more specific evidence is provided.

Without specific evidence or context, it's impossible to definitively label the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have conducted a thorough investigation and found the following:

- There are public records and meeting minutes showing that the individual did propose the creation of free parking lots in front of paid parking zones.
- The proposal was discussed in council meetings and received some support.
- The individual consistently advocated for this policy during their tenure.

Based on this hypothetical evidence, the claim would be considered accurate.

Without access to such data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge and typical patterns, mafia-related activity can be sporadic and subject to law enforcement efforts.

1. **Identify the Metric**: Determine what rating is being referenced (e.g., credit rating, economic performance, sports ranking, etc.).
2. **Compare Data**: Look at reliable sources to compare the ratings of the countries mentioned (in this case, Italy and Spain).
3. **Assess Consistency**: Verify if the claim about the rating being consistently higher than Italy's and at the same level as Spain's holds true over the relevant period.

Without specific data, we can't verify the claim accurately. Therefore, a conservative approach would be to label the claim as 'Half True' until further evidence is provided.

В Китае миллионы заразившихся коронавирусом,false,ru,'Millions infected with coronavirus in China'.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Millions infected with coronavirus in China,"" we need up-to-date and reliable data sources. As of my last update in October 2023, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China has been significant but has not reached millions in a single wave or outbreak. However, the situation can change rapidly, and it's important to refer to the latest data from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or national health authorities.

Let's evaluate this claim.

Mikola Statkiewicz, a prominent opposition figure in Belarus, was indeed a candidate in the 2010 presidential elections. He was subsequently arrested and imprisoned multiple times for his political activities. As of the latest reliable information available, Statkiewicz has been imprisoned on several occasions, including a high-profile case in 2011. However, the specific claim that he is still in prison as of the time of the statement or the context of the claim (five years ago from the statement) requires verification with the most recent and accurate information.

Given that Statkiewicz has been a recurrent target of political repression and has faced multiple imprisonments, it is plausible that he could be in prison. However, without the most current and specific information on his status at the exact time referenced in the claim, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the statement with absolute certainty.

Therefore, based on the general pattern of his repeated imprisonments but lacking the most recent confirmation, the claim can be considered 'Mostly True.'

1. **""Serbia was on the brink of bankruptcy three years ago""**: This is a subjective statement and would require specific economic indicators to verify. Serbia has faced economic challenges, but whether it was on the ""brink of bankruptcy"" is debatable without concrete data.

2. **""but today it has a budget surplus""**: Serbia has reported budget surpluses in recent years, which is accurate.

3. **""economic growth significantly higher than the European average""**: Serbia's economic growth has been robust, but comparing it to the European average requires specific data. Generally, Serbia's growth rate has been higher than the EU average in recent years.

4. **""Serbia has shown that it knows how to win. Not just in basketball and water polo, but also in economics and politics.""**: This is a subjective and rhetorical statement that cannot be objectively verified as true or false.

Since I don't have real-time data or access to current news sources, I'll outline the steps you would take to verify this claim:

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look for official statements or press releases from the Ministry of Agriculture on their website or through official communication channels.
2. **Review News Reports**: Check reputable news outlets for articles that report on the subsidy increase. These articles should cite the Ministry of Agriculture as their source.
3. **Consult Government Budgets**: If available, review the government's budget allocations for agriculture to see if the subsidy increase is reflected.
4. **Cross-Reference with Other Sources**: Compare the information with statements from industry experts or agricultural associations.

Assuming you have followed these steps and found corroborating evidence from multiple reliable sources, the claim would likely be considered 'True'. If there is some discrepancy or lack of clarity in the details, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the sources are mixed or the information is not fully corroborated, it could be 'Half True'.

1. **Data and Reports**: There are various reports and studies that track illicit financial flows and offshore activities. Organizations like Global Financial Integrity (GFI) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) often provide insights into these issues.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: To determine if Kazakhstan is the leader in Central Asia for such activities, we need to compare it with other countries in the region, such as Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.

3. **Specific Evidence**: Without specific data or reports directly claiming that Kazakhstan leads in this regard, it is challenging to definitively state the truth of the claim.

Given the lack of specific, verifiable data in the prompt, and the complexity of determining the exact scale of illegal capital transfers, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted without additional information. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider the claim as partially accurate but not fully substantiated.

1. **Duration of DS Rule**: Verify if DS (assuming it refers to a specific political party or administration) has indeed been in power for 16 years.
2. **Number of People Going to Soup Kitchens**: Check if the figure of 10,000 people is accurate and sourced from reliable data.
3. **Causality**: Determine if there is a direct or indirect causal link between the DS rule and the number of people going to soup kitchens.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively conclude the truthfulness of the claim. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume the following:

- **Duration of DS Rule**: This can be verified through historical records.
- **Number of People Going to Soup Kitchens**: This would require data from relevant social services or NGOs.
- **Causality**: This is the most complex part, as it involves understanding the economic and social policies of the DS rule and their impact on poverty and food security.

2. **Financial Stability**: The claim asserts that the country offers financial stability, which is a subjective measure but can be evaluated based on economic indicators.
3. **Labor Force and Its Quality**: The claim posits that the labor force is of high quality and beneficial for investors. This can be assessed through metrics like education levels, skill sets, and productivity.

Without specific data to compare these factors with surrounding countries, it's difficult to definitively say whether the profit achieved is greater. However, the claim is plausible if the country indeed has favorable conditions in these areas.

However, the claim can be analyzed based on general knowledge and the typical patterns of international recognition.

1. **General Patterns of Recognition**: Countries recognizing the independence of a state often do so gradually over time, with multiple countries recognizing a new state within a given period.

2. **Kosovo's Recognition**: Kosovo declared independence in 2008, and since then, many countries have recognized its independence. The specific number of countries recognizing Kosovo's independence during a particular administration would need to be verified through official records or statements.

To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Policy Change**: The claim asserts that there has been a change in policy where penalties for early retirement are no longer lifetime but are waived once the individual reaches the full retirement age of 65.
2. **Financial Situation**: The claim mentions that the state has more money, which allows for this change in policy.
3. **Gratitude Towards Pensioners**: The state expresses a desire to thank pensioners by removing penalties once they reach the full retirement age.

The typical oil extraction rate from sunflowers is about 40-45%.

Given the claim:
- Sunflower yield: 300,000 to 320,000 tons
- Edible oil produced: about 130,000 tons

Let's calculate the expected oil yield using the average extraction rate:

1. Lower bound of sunflower yield (300,000 tons):
   - 300,000 tons * 40% = 120,000 tons of oil
   - 300,000 tons * 45% = 135,000 tons of oil

2. Upper bound of sunflower yield (320,000 tons):
   - 320,000 tons * 40% = 128,000 tons of oil
   - 320,000 tons * 45% = 144,000 tons of oil

The claim states that the sunflower yield will produce about 130,000 tons of edible oil, which falls within the range calculated above (120,000 to 144,000 tons).

1. **Historical Trends**: If pensions have historically increased in line with salary increases, this claim is more likely to be true.
2. **Current Economic Policies**: If the government or relevant authorities have policies in place to ensure that pensions keep pace with salary increases, this claim is more likely to be true.
3. **Legislative Actions**: If there are laws or regulations that mandate pensions to increase with salaries, this claim is more likely to be true.

Without specific data or context, it is difficult to fully validate or refute the claim. However, generally, pensions are often linked to inflation or cost-of-living adjustments rather than directly to salary increases. Therefore, the claim might be partially true but not entirely accurate.

80 proc. poznaniaków to wierzący katolicy.,true,pl,80% of Poznan residents are practicing Catholics.,"To evaluate the claim that ""80% of Poznan residents are practicing Catholics,"" we would ideally need access to reliable and recent survey data or census information specific to Poznan. However, without such data, we can consider general trends and available information.

Poland is known for having a high percentage of Catholics, with around 90% of the population identifying as Catholic. However, the term ""practicing Catholics"" typically refers to those who actively participate in religious activities such as attending Mass regularly. This percentage is generally lower than the overall identification as Catholic.

According to various surveys and studies, the percentage of practicing Catholics in Poland tends to be around 40-50%. While there might be regional variations, an 80% figure for practicing Catholics in Poznan seems unusually high compared to national trends.

Therefore, without specific data to confirm the 80% claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is likely exaggerated.

Without specific data or context, it's difficult to definitively say whether this claim is true or false. However, it is generally known that countries have different approaches and levels of commitment to social welfare. Some countries, like the Nordic nations, are often cited for their high levels of social welfare spending and comprehensive social safety nets.

Without this data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you through the process of how to determine the truthfulness of such a claim.

Here's what you would need to do:

1. Identify the number of chapters opened and closed by Montenegro.
2. Identify the number of chapters opened and closed by the country referred to as ""we.""
3. Compare the two sets of data.

If the data shows that Montenegro has opened more chapters but has closed the same number as the other country, the claim would be 'True.' If there are significant discrepancies, it could be 'Mostly True,' 'Half True,' 'Mostly False,' or 'False,' depending on the degree of accuracy.

Since I don't have access to real-time data, I'll provide a hypothetical evaluation:

- If Montenegro has opened 30 chapters and closed 20, and the other country has opened 25 chapters and closed 20, the claim would be 'True.'
- If there are minor discrepancies (e.g., Montenegro has closed 19 chapters and the other country has closed 20), the claim might be 'Mostly True.'
- If there are significant discrepancies (e.g., Montenegro has closed 15 chapters and the other country has closed 20), the claim might be 'Half True.'
- If the discrepancies are substantial (e.g., Montenegro has closed 10 chapters and the other country has closed 20), the claim might be 'Mostly False.'
- If the data completely contradicts the claim (e.g., Montenegro has not closed any chapters), the claim would be 'False.'

„Svetska ekonomska kriza neće uticati na zaposlenost u Srbiji. Neće biti talasa otpuštanja…“,false,sr,"""The global economic crisis will not affect employment in Serbia. There will not be a wave of layoffs...""","To evaluate the claim that ""The global economic crisis will not affect employment in Serbia. There will not be a wave of layoffs..."", we need to consider various factors such as the severity of the global economic crisis, Serbia's economic integration and dependence on global markets, and the specific measures taken by the Serbian government to mitigate potential impacts.

1. **Global Economic Integration**: Serbia, like many countries, is integrated into the global economy. Economic downturns in major trading partners can lead to reduced demand for Serbian goods and services, potentially impacting employment.

2. **Historical Precedent**: Past economic crises have shown that few countries are entirely immune to global economic downturns. Even if the direct impact is minimal, indirect effects through reduced trade, investment, and tourism can still affect employment.

3. **Government Measures**: The effectiveness of government policies to protect employment during a crisis is crucial. If the Serbian government has robust measures in place to support businesses and prevent layoffs, the impact could be mitigated.

4. **Economic Indicators**: Current economic indicators and forecasts for Serbia would provide a clearer picture of whether the claim is likely to hold true.

Without specific data and context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general economic principles and historical patterns, it is unlikely that Serbia would be entirely unaffected by a global economic crisis. Therefore, the claim that there will not be a wave of layoffs is likely overly optimistic.

Without the actual report in hand, I'll provide a general assessment based on typical criteria used in such reports.

The claim suggests that the report demonstrates ""enormous progress"" of the parliament and that the assembly has ""grown to the European task."" This implies significant advancements in legislative alignment, institutional capacity, and democratic standards.

In EU progress reports, the evaluation often includes a mix of positive developments and areas needing improvement. It's rare for a report to indicate ""enormous progress"" without also highlighting significant shortcomings.

Given this understanding, the claim likely overstates the findings of the report. While there may be notable progress, it is unlikely that the report would use the term ""enormous"" without qualifiers. Therefore, the claim is likely overly optimistic.

In the country being compared to Germany (which isn't specified in the claim), the claim states that mothers can stay away from work for up to two years. Without knowing the specific country, we can't accurately compare. However, we can assess the general claim that the maternity rights are greater than in Germany based on the duration mentioned.

If the unspecified country indeed offers up to two years of maternity leave with job protection and some form of pay, it could be considered more generous than Germany's policy in terms of duration.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries experienced significant increases in public debt due to government spending on economic stimulus packages, healthcare, and other relief measures. While the exact percentage increase can vary by country, it is generally accepted that public debt increased substantially in many nations.

For example, according to various economic reports and data from organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, many countries saw their debt-to-GDP ratios increase by more than 10 percent. This increase was largely driven by the extraordinary measures taken to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.

Given this context, the claim that debt increased by over 10 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely accurate for many countries.

- Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic have different starting ages, but many start at age 6 or 7.
- Countries like Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia typically have a compulsory school starting age of 6.

While not all EU countries start compulsory education at age 6, a significant number do. However, it is crucial to verify if exactly 22 countries have this policy. Given the variability and the potential for recent changes in education policies, the claim might be slightly exaggerated but largely accurate.

1. **Source and Context**: The claim mentions that Serbia was declared the leading country in Southeast Europe for attracting foreign direct investments (FDI) with an inflow of 2.56 billion dollars. However, it does not specify the source or the exact date of this declaration, which is crucial for verification.

2. **Comparative Data**: The claim states that Serbia attracted more FDI than any other country in the region. This requires comparative data from other countries in Southeast Europe to verify.

3. **Time Frame**: The claim mentions ""four days ago,"" which implies a recent event. Without a specific date, it's challenging to verify the timeliness of this information.

4. **Official Reports**: Typically, such claims are backed by reports from international organizations like the World Bank, IMF, or regional economic bodies. Verification would require checking these sources.

Generally, labor inspectorates aim to ensure compliance with labor laws and regulations, and a key part of their effectiveness is the element of surprise. However, in some jurisdictions or under certain circumstances, inspectorates may be required to announce their inspections in advance to avoid legal challenges or ensure proper documentation.

Without specific context or knowledge of the particular regulations governing the National Labor Inspectorate in question, it is difficult to definitively say whether they must announce every inspection. However, based on general practices, it is more common for labor inspections to be unannounced to maintain their effectiveness.

Given this general understanding, the claim that the National Labor Inspectorate must announce every inspection is likely not accurate in most contexts.

Without access to specific data, I cannot definitively confirm the claim. However, I can provide guidance on how you could verify this information:

1. **Check Government Reports**: Look for reports from the Serbian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, or the Serbian Statistical Office.
2. **International Trade Data**: Review data from international organizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
3. **Economic Analysis**: Consult economic reports from agencies such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
4. **News Articles**: Search for contemporary news articles from reputable sources that discuss Serbian agricultural exports during the early months of 2011.

If the data from these sources confirms a 40% increase in agricultural exports from Serbia in the first months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, the claim would be considered 'True'. If the data shows a significant but not exactly 40% increase, the claim might be 'Mostly True'. If the increase is modest or the data is mixed, it could be 'Half True'. If there is little to no increase, or the data contradicts the claim significantly, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Generally, many countries have laws and constitutional protections that guarantee certain rights to LGBT individuals. However, the actual enforcement and societal acceptance of these rights can vary widely.

In many places, LGBT individuals do have legal protections and can exercise their rights, but they may still face discrimination, harassment, or other barriers that effectively restrict their rights in practice. Therefore, while the statement is true in a legal sense for many jurisdictions, the practical reality may not always align perfectly with the legal protections.

1. The actual deficit is 25 billion dinars.
2. The planned deficit is 90 billion dinars.
3. The claim states that the actual deficit is ""three and a half times less than what the IMF would be satisfied with.""

First, we need to understand what ""three and a half times less"" means mathematically. If the actual deficit is three and a half times less than the planned deficit, we can express this as:

\[ \text{Planned Deficit} = 3.5 \times \text{Actual Deficit} \]

Given that the actual deficit is 25 billion dinars, we can calculate the planned deficit as:

\[ 90 \text{ billion dinars} = 3.5 \times 25 \text{ billion dinars} \]

Solving for the actual deficit:

\[ 90 = 3.5 \times 25 \]
\[ 90 = 87.5 \]

This calculation shows that the planned deficit of 90 billion dinars is approximately 3.5 times the actual deficit of 25 billion dinars. However, there is a slight discrepancy because 3.5 times 25 is 87.5, not exactly 90.

Given this minor discrepancy, the claim is mostly accurate but not perfectly precise. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true but is very close to being accurate.

2. **Decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: If it is true that GDP has declined for the first time in 16 months, this part of the claim is also true.

1. **Low Purchasing Power**: This can indeed influence food prices by affecting demand. If consumers have less money to spend, demand for food may decrease, which could stabilize or even lower prices.

2. **Rational and Realistic Attitude of Citizens**: This factor is more subjective. While consumer behavior can influence demand and therefore prices, it is less clear how significant this factor is compared to others like supply chain issues, government policies, or global market conditions.

However, food prices are also influenced by a wide range of other factors such as production costs, supply chain efficiency, government subsidies, international trade, and weather conditions affecting crop yields. These factors are not mentioned in the claim but are crucial in determining food prices.

Given the complexity and multitude of factors that affect food prices, the claim that low purchasing power and rational consumer attitudes are the primary stabilizers is an oversimplification. While these factors play a role, they are not the sole or even primary determinants.

„Vanredno povećanje penzija 2008. godine od 10 odsto obezbedilo je sigurnost najstarijoj populaciji i pre nadolazeće krize.“,mostly false,sr,"""The extraordinary increase in pensions by 10 percent in 2008 ensured security for the oldest population before the upcoming crisis.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the impact of a 10 percent increase in pensions in 2008. The claim suggests that this increase provided security for the oldest population before an upcoming crisis.

### Analysis:

1. **Increase in Pensions:**
   - The claim states there was a 10 percent increase in pensions in 2008. This specific detail would need to be verified with historical data. If such an increase did occur, it would be a significant boost in pension incomes.

2. **Security for the Oldest Population:**
   - An increase in pensions can indeed provide financial security for the elderly population by increasing their disposable income. However, the extent to which this increase provided ""security"" would depend on various factors such as the cost of living, economic conditions, and other social benefits available.

3. **Upcoming Crisis:**
   - The claim refers to an ""upcoming crisis,"" likely referring to the 2008 financial crisis. The crisis had a significant impact on economies worldwide, leading to job losses, reduced government spending, and economic uncertainty.

### Verification:

- **Historical Data:** Checking historical records and government announcements from 2008 would confirm if there was indeed a 10 percent increase in pensions.
- **Economic Impact:** Analyzing the economic conditions and the impact of the financial crisis on pensioners would help determine the effectiveness of the increase in providing security.

### Conclusion:

Without specific historical data, it is challenging to definitively confirm the 10 percent increase. However, assuming the increase did occur, it is plausible that it provided some financial relief to pensioners. Whether this relief was sufficient to ensure ""security"" during the financial crisis is more debatable and would require a deeper analysis of the economic conditions and the effectiveness of the increase.

Given the context and the need for further verification, the claim is likely 'Mostly True'. The increase in pensions would have provided some security, but the extent of this security during the crisis is not fully certain.

Only twenty-million strong Romania is ahead of us.""","To evaluate the claim that Serbia is the second military power in the region, with only Romania ahead of it, we need to consider various factors such as military size, budget, equipment, and overall capabilities.

1. **Military Size and Budget**: Serbia's military budget and personnel size are significant but not necessarily the second largest in the region. Countries like Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria also have substantial military forces and budgets.

2. **Regional Context**: The claim refers to the ""entire region,"" which is somewhat vague. If we consider the Balkans, Eastern Europe, or the broader European context, the ranking might differ.

3. **Comparison with Romania**: Romania has a larger population and a larger military budget compared to Serbia, which aligns with the claim that Romania is ahead. However, other countries in the region, such as Turkey, have much larger military capabilities.

4. **Overall Military Capabilities**: Military power is not just about size and budget but also about technology, training, and strategic alliances. Serbia has been modernizing its military, but it is not clear if it outranks all other countries in the region except Romania.

Based on these considerations, the claim that Serbia is the second military power in the entire region, with only Romania ahead, is likely an exaggeration. Other countries in the region have significant military capabilities that challenge this ranking.

The claim states that ""over four hundred of the eight hundred and some police stations were liquidated during the time of the Civic Platform.""

First, let's break down the numbers:
- The total number of police stations is given as ""eight hundred and some,"" which we can approximate to around 800.
- The claim states that ""over four hundred"" were liquidated.

Without specific data to verify the exact numbers, we can analyze the plausibility of the claim:
- If approximately 800 police stations existed and over 400 were liquidated, that would mean more than 50% of the police stations were closed.

The term ""liquidated"" suggests a significant reduction in the number of police stations, which would typically be a notable event and likely reported or documented.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact numbers, the claim could be considered plausible but requires verification. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim can be considered partly credible but not fully verified.

If the numbers provided are accurate (35 contracts leading to nearly 19,000 jobs), then the claim implies that the work for those 19,000 workers is significant. The significance of the work would depend on various factors such as the nature of the jobs, their impact on the economy, and the duration of the employment.

Let's break down the claim:

1. **Percentage of Male and Female Teachers**: The claim states that 81% of educators are women and 19% are men. This aligns with general trends in many countries where the teaching profession is predominantly female.

2. **Number of Male Teachers**: The claim that there are only 60,000 male teachers is specific and would need verification against country-specific data. Without a specific country context, it's challenging to verify this number.

1. **""Every fountain in the world overflows, it has a compensation basin and pumps that return the water.""**
   - This is generally true. Most modern fountains are designed with mechanisms to handle overflow and recycle water.

2. **""Let them go to Madrid to see what kind of fountains they have there.""**
   - This is a rhetorical statement encouraging critics to observe fountains in Madrid, implying they are well-designed and do not overflow problematically. Without specific details, it's difficult to evaluate the truthfulness directly, but the implication is that Madrid has good fountains.

3. **""They were against the removal of Dimitrije Tucović, but they don't even know who he is, and now they are bothered by the fountain and the mast.""**
   - This statement is more subjective and dependent on the specific context and individuals being referred to. It asserts that critics opposed the removal of Dimitrije Tucović but lack knowledge about him, and are now bothered by a fountain and a mast. Without additional context, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of these claims.

- Novi Pazar is a city in Serbia and does not have international recognition as a separate entity.

False/Misleading aspects:
- The claim seems to imply that Novi Pazar has no distinguishing features, which is not accurate. Novi Pazar is the cultural center of the Sandžak region and has a unique history and demographic makeup, with a significant Bosniak population.

As of my last update in October 2023, Serbia has made progress in reducing poverty, but the claim needs to be assessed in the context of specific definitions and measurements of poverty. ""Extreme poverty"" is often defined as living on less than $1.90 a day, and ""poverty risk"" can vary based on different economic indicators.

While Serbia has seen economic growth and improvements in living standards, complete eradication of extreme poverty is a significant claim that would require robust evidence. Reductions in poverty risk are more plausible but would still need to be supported by data.

1. **Source of Refund**: The claim states that the refund will come from funds seized from criminals. If this is indeed the mechanism provided by the law and is being followed, then this part of the claim is true.

2. **Burden of Compensation**: The claim asserts that the burden will not be borne by the citizens of Serbia but by the criminals. If the funds are truly coming from seized criminal assets, then this part is also true.

3. **Value of Seized Property**: The claim mentions that the value of the property temporarily seized is already much higher than the amount to be refunded. This is a factual statement that would need to be verified with official records or statements.

1. **Estimated Value of Nationalized Property**: The value of property nationalized by the state can be difficult to assess accurately without specific data. Historical records, current property values, and inflation rates would all play a role in determining this figure.

2. **Serbia's Economic Status**: Serbia's GDP and financial capabilities are crucial in evaluating the feasibility of such a large compensation. As of recent data, Serbia's GDP is significantly lower than 200 billion euros.

3. **Reliability of the Source**: Without knowing the source of this claim, it's challenging to assess its credibility. Official government statements, economic reports, or independent analyses would add weight to the claim.

   - This statement is not accurate. While prolonged ventilation can indicate a more severe illness and is associated with higher mortality rates, it does not mean that the chances of survival are close to zero. The 88% mortality rate is not universally supported by medical literature.

2. **""Because ventilation does not help breathing, it does not supply the body with oxygen.""**

If the party indeed won 100,000 voters in the first elections and 200,000 voters in the second elections, then the claim is true. However, without specific data to verify these numbers, we can only assess the claim based on the information given.

Assuming the numbers provided are accurate:

- The claim that they won 100,000 voters in the first elections is true.
- The claim that they won 200,000 voters in the second elections (doubling the first result) is true.

Na sędziów w stanie spoczynku idą pełne składki ZUS z budżetu państwa.,half true,pl,Full ZUS contributions for retired judges are paid from the state budget.,"To evaluate the claim that ""Full ZUS contributions for retired judges are paid from the state budget,"" we need to consider the context and specific policies related to judges' retirement benefits and the role of ZUS (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych, the Social Insurance Institution in Poland).

In Poland, the retirement benefits for judges are typically managed differently from those of other professions due to their special status. Judges often have specific retirement schemes that may involve contributions from the state budget. However, the details of these schemes can be complex and may change over time.

Given the general policy framework, it is likely that the state does contribute significantly to the retirement benefits of judges, including ZUS contributions. However, without specific, up-to-date legislation or policy documents, it is difficult to assert the claim as entirely true without some reservation.

Therefore, the claim is likely accurate but may not cover all nuances or exceptions. Hence, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Without access to such data, it is impossible to verify the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume the information provided is based on reliable sources.

Given that the statement is specific and quantitative, if the data source is reputable and the figures are accurate, the claim can be considered true. However, without verification, we can only speculate on the accuracy.

Without specific data, it's challenging to give a precise answer. However, let's break down the claim logically:

1. **Claim Analysis**: The claim states that the electricity in question is 30 percent cheaper than the next cheapest electricity in the region.
2. **Potential Issues**: The claim relies heavily on precise data and definitions. For example, ""region"" could refer to Europe as a whole or a specific subset of countries. Additionally, electricity prices can vary significantly due to factors like subsidies, taxes, and market regulations.
3. **Data Verification**: Verifying this claim would require access to up-to-date and comprehensive data on electricity prices across Europe. Organizations like Eurostat or national statistical agencies would be reliable sources for such data.

Without specific data, the claim cannot be fully verified. However, given the specificity of the claim (30 percent cheaper), it is likely that some level of data supports it, but it could also be exaggerated or misleading without context.

Иностранцам продлят сроки пребывания в Казахстане в связи с коронавирусом,true,ru,"""Foreigners will have their stay in Kazakhstan extended due to the coronavirus.""","To verify the claim that ""Foreigners will have their stay in Kazakhstan extended due to the coronavirus,"" we need to look at official sources and statements from the Kazakhstan government.

During the pandemic, many countries, including Kazakhstan, implemented measures to extend the stay of foreigners who were unable to leave due to travel restrictions and other pandemic-related issues. The government of Kazakhstan has issued various directives and announcements regarding the extension of visas and temporary stay permits for foreigners.

Based on available information, Kazakhstan did extend the stay of foreigners due to the coronavirus pandemic to accommodate those who were unable to leave the country. Therefore, the claim is accurate.

I take this opportunity to congratulate both of them.""","To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **""The Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, which was awarded to Njegoš and other giants, ceased to be awarded in 1917.""**
   - This is historically accurate. The Imperial Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky was a Russian imperial award that was discontinued after the Russian Revolution in 1917.

2. **""The Order of Alexander Nevsky, which was awarded to (President) Aleksandar Vučić, is noteworthy but does not carry the same weight.""**
   - The modern Order of Alexander Nevsky is a different award established by the Russian Federation in 2010. It is indeed noteworthy but does not carry the same historical significance as the imperial order.

3. **""Two years ago, it was also awarded to Bogoljub Karić.""**
   - This part requires verification. If Bogoljub Karić did receive the modern Order of Alexander Nevsky two years ago, then this statement is true.

Given the historical accuracy of the first two points and assuming the third point is factually correct (which would need to be verified independently), the overall claim can be considered mostly accurate with a caveat on the third point.

1. The sum of funds in the state budget reserve has increased by approximately 15%–20% compared to last year.
2. Today, this sum amounts to around 250 million PLN.

Without specific data to verify the percentage increase or the current sum, we can't definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume the MP is quoting figures from a reliable source, the statement appears plausible.

Given the context and the typical range of government budget figures, a 15%–20% increase and a sum of around 250 million PLN could be realistic. However, without independent verification, we can't confirm the exact figures.

While I don't have direct access to current data, I can guide you on how to verify this claim.

You can check official sources such as the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia or international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank, which publish economic data including inflation rates.

If the actual inflation rate for 2012 was close to 12 percent, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If it was significantly different but somewhat close, it might be 'Half True'. If it was far off, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Let's assume, for the sake of this exercise, that the actual inflation rate in Serbia for 2012 was around 10 percent.

1. **""All matters have been appealed in court.""**
2. **""The court was supposed to rule on these matters in June.""**
3. **""Only Patryk Jaki challenged all the judicial panels.""**

Without additional context or specific details about the legal proceedings and actions of Patryk Jaki, it is challenging to verify the accuracy of each component. However, the claim suggests a series of legal actions and a specific timeline, which could be factually checked if more information were available.

Given the lack of specific details to verify each part of the claim, the most conservative assessment would be:

As of my last update in October 2023, NATO countries have different levels of military spending relative to their GDP.

According to recent data, the countries that typically spend the most on their military as a proportion of GDP include the United States, Greece, Estonia, Poland, and a few others. If the claim states that only nine NATO countries are ahead in terms of military spending, it is essential to check the specific rankings and proportions.

Without the exact figures for the current year, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general trends and available data up to my last update, it is plausible that the statement could be accurate or nearly accurate.

Given the information available, the claim that only nine NATO countries are ahead in terms of military spending is likely to be mostly true, considering the typical high spenders and the general ranking among NATO countries.

1. ""180 million for internet and equipment for students and teachers are funds from the existing POPC, which we decided in agreement with the EC to allocate for a new purpose.""
   - This part of the claim suggests that the funds are being reallocated from an existing budget (POPC) with the agreement of the European Commission (EC). This is a specific detail that would need verification through official documents or statements from relevant authorities.

2. ""The EU did not provide any new funds, not even 1€ to fight Covid-19 in Poland.""
   - This part of the claim asserts that no new funds were provided by the EU specifically for fighting Covid-19 in Poland. This would also need to be verified through official EU statements or budget allocations.

Without specific evidence or sources, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, for the sake of argument and assuming the claim is based on verifiable facts, here's a possible analysis:

- If the first part is true (funds are reallocated from the existing POPC with EC agreement), and the second part is also true (no new funds were provided by the EU for Covid-19 in Poland), then the claim would be accurate.

Given the lack of specific evidence, a reasonable assessment would be that the claim could be mostly true if both parts are generally accurate but might have some nuances or specifics that are not fully addressed.

However, without access to specific historical records or databases, I can provide a general approach to fact-checking such a claim:

1. **Identify the Source**: Check if the claim originates from a credible source, such as official government records, news articles from reputable outlets, or academic studies.
2. **Verify the Timeline**: Ensure that the timeline matches the historical events. The claim states that the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) privatized the power plant in Łódź between 2004 and 2005.
3. **Cross-Reference**: Look for multiple sources that confirm the privatization event and the party responsible for it.

Given the lack of specific verification tools here, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, based on typical fact-checking practices, if the claim aligns with multiple credible sources and the timeline is accurate, it would likely be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

Участившиеся ошибки Zoom могут представлять угрозу для Казахстана,half true,ru,Increasing Zoom errors may pose a threat to Kazakhstan.,"To evaluate the claim that ""Increasing Zoom errors may pose a threat to Kazakhstan,"" we need to consider the context and the potential impact of such errors.

Zoom is a video conferencing platform widely used for various purposes, including business meetings, education, and personal communication. Errors in Zoom could include technical glitches, security vulnerabilities, or service disruptions. While these issues can be frustrating and may disrupt communications and workflows, they are generally not considered a direct threat to national security or stability.

However, if the claim refers to specific sectors such as government communications, critical infrastructure, or highly sensitive data exchange, then persistent and significant Zoom errors could potentially pose a risk. For example, if Zoom is used for high-level government meetings or in critical industries, recurring errors could lead to miscommunications, delays, or even security breaches.

Without specific context or data on the extent and nature of these errors and their impact on Kazakhstan's operations, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false. It likely falls somewhere in the middle, acknowledging that while Zoom errors can cause disruptions, their impact on national-level threats is typically limited.

1. **""Serbia respects the territorial integrity of every UN member state, including Ukraine.""**
   - This statement is generally true. Serbia has officially recognized Ukraine's territorial integrity, including Crimea, as part of Ukraine. Serbia has not recognized the annexation of Crimea by Russia.

2. **""Serbia cannot impose sanctions on Russia, because Russia has never imposed sanctions on Serbia.""**
   - This statement is also true. Serbia has not imposed sanctions on Russia, and Russia has not imposed sanctions on Serbia. Serbia's decision not to impose sanctions on Russia is often justified by its historical and political ties with Russia, as well as economic considerations.

If all three sources (the contract, your statement, and Mr. Giom's statement) consistently confirm that 1370 workers will be employed in the next few years, then the claim is likely true. However, if there are discrepancies or any source suggests a different number or timeline, the claim's truthfulness would be diminished.

Without the specific details from the contract, your statement, and Mr. Giom's statement, we can only make a general assessment. Assuming all three sources align perfectly, the claim would be true. If there are minor discrepancies, it might be mostly true. If there are significant discrepancies, it could be half true or mostly false. If the claim is completely unsupported by any of the sources, it would be false.

Without specific data, I'll provide a general framework for assessing the claim:

1. **Lowest Birth Rate in 2002 or 2003**: This part of the claim would need to be verified with demographic data from the country in question. If official statistics show that the birth rate was indeed at its lowest in 2002 or 2003, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Reduction of Maternity Leave**: This part of the claim requires checking government policies and legislative changes during the SLD government's term. If there is documentation showing that maternity leave was reduced from 18 to 16 weeks during this period, this part of the claim would also be true.

As of my last update in October 2023, Serbia has indeed made significant strides in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) due to its strategic location, relatively low labor costs, and favorable business conditions. However, determining whether it is the ""most desirable"" requires a comparative analysis with other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and others.

These countries also offer competitive advantages, including well-developed infrastructure, skilled workforces, and strong economic growth. While Serbia has been successful in attracting investments, it is not definitive that it is the most desirable location compared to all other countries in the region.

Without such data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can offer a general approach to how one might assess this claim:

1. **Budget Analysis**: Compare the budget allocated for anti-smog measures in both cities. This could include funds for environmental projects, air quality monitoring, and public awareness campaigns.

2. **Initiatives and Policies**: Evaluate the number and scale of initiatives and policies implemented in each city to combat smog. This could include regulations on industrial emissions, promotion of public transportation, and support for green technologies.

3. **Impact Assessment**: Assess the impact of these measures on air quality in both cities. This could involve looking at air quality indices and trends over time.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: Determine if the problem of smog is indeed comparable in both cities by examining air quality data and the sources of pollution.

That is of crucial importance to us.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the statement regarding HBIS's employment practices at the copper mines in South Africa. The claim states that HBIS has maintained employment levels at around 2,200 to 2,300 people without reductions.

Without specific data or sources to verify the exact numbers, we can analyze the claim based on general knowledge and typical business practices in such situations. It is common for companies to maintain or even increase employment levels after taking over mines to ensure smooth operations and to comply with local regulations and agreements.

Given the specificity of the numbers provided (2,200 to 2,300), it suggests that the claim is based on some form of documentation or reporting. However, without direct verification, we cannot assert it as entirely true or false.

Therefore, the claim is likely accurate but may require additional verification for absolute certainty.

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) does produce various guidelines and recommendations, often referred to as ""soft law,"" which means they are not legally binding but provide important guidance. The document mentioned, ""Guidelines on the Freedom of Association,"" likely fits into this category. Soft law documents typically offer recommendations and best practices rather than enforceable laws.

However, without specific verification of the exact document and its contents, it's best to categorize this claim as mostly accurate but not fully verifiable in all details. Thus, the claim is:

With that money, the most significant projects in the city could have been financed, such as the construction of a kindergarten in Pori, a sports hall in Krčagovo, and a swimming pool.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two main points:

1. **The budget damage of over four million euros over three years**: This is a factual statement that can be verified with financial records. If the budget records show a loss or mismanagement of funds totaling more than four million euros over the specified period, then this part of the claim is true.

2. **The potential projects that could have been financed with that money**: This is more subjective. While it's possible to estimate the costs of these projects, the claim assumes that the damaged budget would have been allocated to these specific projects. Without clear evidence that these projects were planned and would have been funded with the lost money, this part of the claim is harder to prove.

Given these points, if the budget damage is verified but the specific projects are not definitively linked to that budget, the claim would be 'Mostly True'. The financial loss is factual, but the potential use of those funds is speculative.

If the official data shows that the number of passengers was indeed around 330 million and that this was a record-breaking figure, the claim would be considered accurate. If the data shows a number close to 330 million but not exactly, it might be considered 'Mostly True'. If the number is significantly different, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

However, based on the general context provided:

1. **IMF**: The International Monetary Fund often promotes transparency and good governance in countries it assists.
2. **Fiscal Council**: Such councils are typically designed to ensure fiscal responsibility and transparency.
3. **Public Enterprises**: Increased openness in their operations generally contributes to transparency.
4. **Šabić and Janković**: Without specific details, it's challenging to assess their contributions.

2. **False/Misleading statements**:

However, without specific evidence or context, it is difficult to definitively confirm or deny the claim. Generally, statements about the complete absence of COVID-19 would be highly scrutinized and unlikely to be true given the ongoing nature of the pandemic.

2. **Quality**: Being the ""best"" is subjective and can depend on various factors such as product quality, customer satisfaction, innovation, and market leadership. Again, this requires specific data and benchmarks to verify.

This claim is related to events during the COVID-19 pandemic in France.

In March 2020, France held the first round of municipal elections despite the growing COVID-19 pandemic. The decision to proceed with the elections was controversial, and many medical professionals expressed concern about the potential health risks. Following the first round, the second round of elections was indeed postponed due to the pandemic.

However, there is no widely reported evidence that French doctors took their government to the Constitutional Court specifically to challenge the decision to hold the first round of local elections. While there were criticisms and concerns raised by medical professionals, a formal legal challenge of this nature is not well-documented.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but lacks clear evidence for the specific legal action mentioned.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, statistics from various organizations often report much higher numbers of domestic violence victims annually. For example, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV), millions of people in the United States alone experience domestic violence each year.

2. **Recent Trends**: The claim states that last year the dependence was 55 percent, and this year it has dropped below 50 percent. This aligns with global trends of diversifying energy sources and reducing dependence on a single supplier.
3. **Verification**: Without specific data, we cannot confirm the exact percentages, but the trend described is consistent with known efforts to diversify energy supplies.

1. **Existence of the White Book**: If the White Book exists and was indeed authored by President Komorowski and Minister Siemoniak with contributions from 300 experts, this part of the claim could be true.
2. **Prediction of No War**: The claim that these experts predicted there would be no war is crucial. Predictions, especially in geopolitics, can be complex and often incorrect. If the document indeed made such a prediction, it would be notable.

Given the lack of specific details and the general nature of predictions, it's reasonable to assume that the claim might be exaggerated or misinterpreted. Geopolitical documents often include a range of scenarios rather than a single definitive prediction.

1. **Check Official Reports**: Look for official reports from local government agencies, urban planning departments, or statistical offices in Poland.
2. **Consult Real Estate Databases**: Some real estate market analysis websites or publications may have the data.
3. **News Articles**: Search for news articles from reliable sources that report on housing construction in 2017 for Łódź and Wrocław.

### Example Verification Process:
1. **Local Government Websites**:
   - Łódź: Look for annual reports or construction permits data.
   - Wrocław: Similarly, check for annual reports or construction data.

2. **Statistical Offices**:
   - Główny Urząd Statystyczny (GUS) - Poland's Central Statistical Office may have detailed data on construction activities.

3. **Real Estate Market Reports**:
   - Websites like Eurostat, local real estate market analysis firms, or industry reports.

### Hypothetical Analysis:
- If the data from these sources confirms that approximately 2800 apartments were built in Łódź and 9000 in Wrocław in 2017, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the numbers are slightly off but still close to the mentioned figures, it could be 'Mostly True'.
- If the numbers are significantly different but within the same order of magnitude, it might be 'Half True'.

2. **""Serbia will continue to suffer in the European Union with the promised supposedly better life""**: This part of the claim implies that Serbia's integration into the EU would not lead to a better life for its citizens. The impact of EU integration on a country's economic and social conditions is complex and can vary significantly.

This could be true, but it requires specific evidence about the appointment process and the individuals involved.

2. **Dragan Đilas also belonged to this regime**: Dragan Đilas was a member of the Democratic Party (DS) and served as the Mayor of Belgrade from 2008 to 2013. The DS was part of the ruling coalition during the time period mentioned.

3. **This happened in 2009, or rather in 2010**: The claim specifies a timeframe for the appointments. This can be verified by looking at records of when prosecutors were appointed in Serbia.

Without specific evidence or historical records to verify the exact dates and the individuals involved in the appointment process, it is challenging to categorically state the truthfulness of the claim. However, assuming Dragan Đilas's association with the regime and the general timing could be accurate, the claim might be partially true but not fully verifiable without additional details.

Without specific data or sources, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that there has been a significant decline in the number and operation of fish hatcheries from the Soviet era to the present day, the claim could be partially accurate.

As of recent data from sources like the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) and other reputable organizations, the rental market in Germany is indeed significant. According to various reports, the percentage of households living in rented apartments is generally around 49% to 55%. This range includes apartments in both urban and rural areas.

Коронавирус становится более заразным и более опасным,false,ru,'Coronavirus is becoming more contagious and more dangerous'.,"The claim that ""Coronavirus is becoming more contagious and more dangerous"" is a complex one and requires careful examination.

1. **More Contagious**: It is true that some variants of the coronavirus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, have been found to be more transmissible than the original strain. This is well-documented by scientific research and public health organizations.

2. **More Dangerous**: The term ""more dangerous"" can be interpreted in various ways, such as causing more severe illness or higher mortality rates. While some variants like Delta have shown increased severity, others like Omicron have shown reduced severity despite being more transmissible. The overall danger can vary depending on the specific variant and other factors like vaccination rates and healthcare access.

Given these points, the claim is partially accurate but oversimplifies a complex situation.

Our philosophy is incentives. The possibility of exchanging furnaces? It's already happening.',"To evaluate the claim effectively, we need to break it down into components and assess each part:

1. **""This is a government program that develops ideas from the law.""**
   - This statement implies that there is a government program designed to implement or develop ideas based on legal frameworks. Without specific context or evidence, this is hard to verify.

2. **""Our philosophy is incentives.""**
   - This suggests that the program uses incentives as a primary method for achieving its goals. Again, without specifics, this is difficult to confirm.

3. **""The possibility of exchanging furnaces? It's already happening.""**
   - This claims that a furnace exchange program is currently in operation. Without additional context or evidence, this is also hard to verify.

Given the lack of specific information and evidence to support or refute the claims, the statement as a whole is ambiguous and cannot be fully verified. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

Augustyn's claim that unemployment was single-digit in 2015, we need to consider the specific numbers provided.

A. Klarenbach states that unemployment was almost 10% in 2015, while U. Augustyn claims it was single-digit, specifically ""9 and something.""

If the unemployment rate was indeed ""9 and something,"" it would technically be single-digit since it is less than 10%. However, the phrase ""almost 10%"" suggests a number very close to 10%, which could still be considered single-digit but on the higher end.

Given the information:
- A. Klarenbach says ""almost 10%"" (likely around 9.8% or 9.9%).
- U. Augustyn says ""9 and something"" (which could be 9.1% to 9.9%).

Since ""9 and something"" is indeed single-digit and ""almost 10%"" could also be interpreted as single-digit, U. Augustyn's claim is largely accurate but could be seen as slightly misleading due to the emphasis on it being single-digit when it was very close to 10%.

While it is true that the Serbian government has used the phrase ""There is no alternative to the EU"" as a slogan, it is not accurate to say that Serbia is the only country to do so. Various governments in countries seeking EU membership or maintaining strong ties with the EU have used similar rhetoric to emphasize the importance of EU integration and the lack of viable alternatives.

1. **VAT Refund Amount**: The claim states that a VAT refund of up to 270 thousand rubles can be made. This is a specific amount and would need to align with the tax laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in question.

2. **Unified Compensation Center**: The claim mentions a ""Unified Compensation Center for the Return of Unpaid Funds."" The existence and legitimacy of such a center would need to be verified.

In that year, ten countries joined the EU: Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

The claim suggests that Poland received more funds than the combined total of the other nine countries that joined the EU in 2004. To verify this, one would need to examine the financial data on EU funding allocated to these countries over a specified period.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge of EU funding, it is unlikely that one country would receive more funds than the combined total of nine other countries. EU funding is generally allocated based on a variety of factors, including population, GDP, and specific needs, and it is distributed to ensure balanced development across all member states.

Given this context, the claim is likely exaggerated or inaccurate. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Here are the key points to consider:
1. **Digital Signal Coverage**: The claim states that 97.8 percent of the population is covered by the digital signal.
2. **Transition from Analog to Digital**: The claim also indicates that the analog signal is being phased out completely.

Without specific data to verify the exact percentage of digital signal coverage, we can rely on general knowledge and reports about digital transitions in countries. Many countries have been transitioning from analog to digital broadcasting, and it is plausible that Serbia has achieved high digital coverage. However, claiming 97.8 percent coverage and the complete phase-out of the analog signal requires precise data to be fully accurate.

The Concordat between the Republic of Poland and the Holy See was signed on July 28, 1993, by Hanna Suchocka, who was the Prime Minister at the time. The SLD came into power later that year, following the parliamentary elections in September 1993.

During the SLD's tenure from 1993 to 1997, the Concordat was not ratified by the Polish Parliament (Sejm). The ratification process was delayed and eventually took place under a different government in 1998.

Given this context, the claim that the SLD did not allow the Concordat to be ratified during their 4 years in power is accurate.

1. **Economic Progress and Salary/Pension Growth**:
   - The claim states that Serbia surpassed other countries in salaries and pensions, except Montenegro, and is expected to overtake Montenegro in a year and a half. This requires specific data on salary and pension growth rates in Serbia and other regional countries, particularly Montenegro.

2. **Public Debt Reduction**:
   - The claim mentions reducing public debt from 78% to 50%, while other countries increased theirs. This can be verified with data from international financial institutions like the IMF or World Bank.

3. **Unemployment Rates**:
   - The claim states that unemployment is the lowest in Serbia. This can be verified with data from regional statistical agencies or international organizations like Eurostat.

Without specific data for each point, a precise evaluation is challenging. However, based on general economic trends and available data up to a certain point, we can make an educated guess.

- Serbia has shown significant economic progress and has been reducing its public debt.
- Unemployment rates in Serbia have been declining.
- Comparative data on salaries and pensions would require specific, up-to-date statistics.

3. **Analyze Budget Documents**: If available, review budget documents or defense spending reports that outline expenditures.

If you find that the claim of an additional expenditure of 35 billion PLN for the purchase of F-35 aircraft is supported by multiple credible sources, then the claim can be considered true or mostly true. If the claim is disputed or lacks credible support, it would be considered half true, mostly false, or false.

Without specific current data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on typical procedures for verifying such claims, here is a hypothetical response:

"Spośród 500 opinii, które Komisja Wenecka wydała w ciągu ostatnich niemal 30 lat, niewielka ilość została jakoś tam nie uwzględniona – np. Rosja putinowska czy Lichtenstein.",true,pl,"'Out of the 500 opinions issued by the Venice Commission over the past nearly 30 years, a small number have been somewhat overlooked - for example, Putin's Russia or Liechtenstein.'","To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. The Venice Commission has issued 500 opinions over nearly 30 years.
2. A small number of these opinions have been somewhat overlooked.
3. Examples of overlooked opinions include those related to Putin's Russia or Liechtenstein.

The claim seems to suggest that the Venice Commission has issued opinions on Putin's Russia and Liechtenstein, but these have received less attention. Without specific data on the attention each opinion has received, it's challenging to verify if they are ""overlooked."" However, it is known that the Venice Commission has issued opinions on Russia and Liechtenstein.

Given that the Venice Commission indeed issues opinions on various countries, including Russia and Liechtenstein, and considering that it is plausible that some opinions receive less attention than others, the claim can be considered mostly accurate, though it lacks specific evidence to fully confirm the extent to which these particular opinions are ""overlooked.""

We will not pay a single euro for these loans, because the projects are now being realized.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. The claim states that seven million euros were paid for loans that were approved earlier but not used.
2. The claim also states that no further payments will be made for these loans because the projects are now being realized.

Without additional context or verification of the facts, it's challenging to determine the absolute truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the information provided, the claim seems to present a clear argument about the financial management of the loans and the projects.

If the claim is accurate in stating that payments were made for unused loans and that no further payments will be made because the projects are being realized, then it could be considered mostly true. However, without independent verification, it's impossible to confirm the full accuracy of the claim.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Appointment and Dismissal**: The President of the United States does appoint judges to the Supreme Court, with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, the President does not have the power to dismiss them. This part of the claim is true.

2. **Life Tenure**: Supreme Court justices do serve for life unless they resign, retire, or are removed from office through the impeachment process. This part of the claim is also true.

However, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' rather than 'True' because it omits the fact that justices can be removed through impeachment, which is a rare but possible process.

The claim states that patients are not receiving the recommended daily norms of essential nutrients like calcium, magnesium, iron, and vitamins, and instead are receiving a 4-fold daily dose of salt. The diet is also described as lacking vegetables, fruits, and juices.

Given the specificity of the claim and the credibility typically associated with an audit office, it is reasonable to assume that there is some level of truth to the statement.

While a small external debt can be beneficial for a country's economic stability and growth, it is not the sole indicator of development potential. Other factors such as GDP growth, infrastructure, education, innovation, political stability, and business environment also play significant roles. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but has some truth to it.

1. **KRUS (Kasa Rolniczego Ubezpieczenia Społecznego)** is the Farmers' Social Insurance Fund in Poland, which typically insures farmers and their families, not employees in general.
2. **Janusz Korwin-Mikke** is a well-known Polish politician and not typically associated with farming activities that would require KRUS insurance.

Given that KRUS is specifically for the agricultural sector and Janusz Korwin-Mikke is known for his political career rather than farming, it is unlikely that he would be insured with KRUS.

Methane is a primary component of natural gas, and its extraction is closely tied to the natural gas industry. According to data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other energy reporting bodies, the global production of natural gas is significantly higher than 1-2 billion m³ annually. As of recent years, the global production of natural gas is measured in trillions of cubic meters per year, not billions.

For context, the global natural gas production in 2020 was approximately 4 trillion cubic meters. This figure far exceeds the 1-2 billion m³ mentioned in the claim.

Given this discrepancy, the claim significantly underestimates the actual scale of methane extraction on an industrial level.

If the statement is factually accurate and can be supported by voting records or official statements indicating that Confederation was the sole group to unanimously oppose the project, then the claim would be true. However, if there is evidence that other groups also unanimously opposed the project or if there were dissenting votes within Confederation, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Given the information provided, the claim appears to be a specific assertion about a political action. Without additional evidence or context, it is difficult to definitively determine the accuracy. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate records and there is no contradictory evidence, the claim would be considered true.

Without specific data to verify the exact numbers, we can analyze the claim logically:

1. **Increase by 300 thousand**: This is a specific and quantifiable increase.
2. **Reached 3.3 million people**: This is another specific and quantifiable figure.

If the increase is indeed 300 thousand and the final number is 3.3 million, then the previous number of people employed would have been 3 million (3.3 million - 300 thousand).

Given that the claim provides specific numbers and the arithmetic checks out, the statement appears to be coherent and plausible. However, without access to official data sources, we cannot confirm the exact accuracy.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **VAT Rate in Poland**: Poland does have a standard VAT rate of 23%, which is one of the highest in the EU.
2. **VAT on Electricity**: The reduced VAT rate on electricity varies among EU countries. As of recent data, Poland applies a standard rate of 23% on electricity.
3. **Comparison with UK and France**: The UK and France do apply reduced VAT rates on electricity, which can be as low as 5%.

   - The decision to launch NATO airstrikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was influenced by reports of humanitarian issues and atrocities, including Walker's reports.

2. **False or misleading elements**:
   - The claim that there was no humanitarian catastrophe or persecution of Kosovo Albanians is contradicted by numerous independent reports and investigations, which documented widespread human rights abuses and violence against civilians.
   - While Walker's reports were influential, they were not the sole basis for the NATO intervention. Other factors, including the broader political and security context, also played significant roles.
   - The claim that Walker opposes the Special Court is not substantiated with clear evidence in the provided text.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to evaluate the claim:

1. **Identify the Act**: Confirm that an act introduced in 2008 restricted money and pensions for former employees of the UB (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa) and SB (Służba Bezpieczeństwa).

2. **Check the Provisions**: Verify that the act included provisions specifically targeting members of the Military Council of National Salvation (Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego, WRON).

3. **Constitutional Tribunal Ruling**: Confirm that the Constitutional Tribunal repealed the provision related to pensions for members of the WRON.

Without access to specific legal databases or documents, I cannot directly verify these details. However, based on the structure and typical processes of legislative and judicial actions, here's a general assessment:

- If the act from 2008 indeed included restrictions on pensions for former UB and SB employees, and if it specifically mentioned members of the WRON, that part of the claim could be true.
- If the Constitutional Tribunal did repeal the provision related to WRON members, this would also support the claim.

According to statistical data from the Central Statistical Office of Poland (Główny Urząd Statystyczny, GUS) and other reputable sources, 2016 marked a significant shift in migration patterns. Prior to 2016, Poland had experienced a net outflow of migrants, particularly after joining the European Union in 2004. However, in 2016, the trend reversed, and Poland saw a net inflow of migrants. This was largely due to factors such as economic growth, job opportunities, and the influx of workers from other countries, particularly Ukraine.

Given this data, the claim is accurate in stating that 2016 was the first year since World War II where more people came to Poland than left.

3. **Contextual Accuracy**: Is the claim being made with proper context, such as specifying the region or the time frame of the local elections?

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively label the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on reliable data and contextually accurate, we can make an educated guess:

- If the actual turnout is indeed just over 30%, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the turnout is slightly different but still very close to 30%, it might be 'Mostly True'.
- If the turnout is significantly different but still somewhat close to 30%, it might be 'Half True'.
- If the turnout is significantly different and not close to 30%, it might be 'Mostly False'.

To evaluate this claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. Poland provides two million posted workers who move around Europe every year.
2. About a quarter of them – half a million.

Let's analyze each part:

1. **Two million posted workers from Poland**:
   Posted workers are employees sent by their employer to carry out a service in another EU Member State on a temporary basis. According to the European Commission and other reliable sources, the number of posted workers from Poland is significant but does not reach two million annually. The actual number is typically in the hundreds of thousands.

2. **About a quarter of them – half a million**:
   If we assume the first part is correct (two million workers), then a quarter of two million would indeed be half a million. However, since the first part is incorrect, this calculation is based on a false premise.

Given that the first part of the claim is inaccurate, the overall claim cannot be true. The number of posted workers from Poland is significantly lower than two million.

Without specific knowledge of the regulations or the context of the SKW, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

Given this general understanding, the claim that the Minister of Defense is not authorized to access any operational materials seems unlikely. Therefore, the claim is likely to be:

Kara pozbawienia wolności w systemie stacjonarnym obecnie w Polsce jest wykonywana wobec ok. 75 tys. osób.,true,pl,"Currently, in Poland, the penalty of deprivation of liberty in the stationary system is being enforced against approximately 75,000 people.","To accurately assess the claim, we would need to refer to the most recent official data regarding the number of people serving prison sentences in Poland. As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have real-time access to the internet to verify the exact number. However, based on available data from reliable sources up to that point, the claim can be evaluated.

According to various reports and statistical data from organizations like the Polish Ministry of Justice or Eurostat, the number of people incarcerated in Poland has generally been around 70,000 to 80,000 in recent years. This suggests that the claim of approximately 75,000 people is plausible but could vary slightly.

Given this context, the claim is likely 'Mostly True'.

However, based on the statement itself, it appears to be an opinion or perspective rather than a factual claim that can be objectively verified as true or false. The speaker is expressing their personal view on whether receiving a doctorate is a private matter and that resignation is an individual act.

Without additional context or specific facts to verify, the statement cannot be definitively categorized as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. Therefore, the claim is more of an opinion and cannot be fact-checked in the traditional sense.

Whoever shows me such a country, I'll take them out to dinner.""","The claim suggests that there is no country that has reduced its budget deficit from eight percent to less than two percent of GDP in just two years. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider historical economic data.

While specific examples might not be widely known, economic history has shown that countries can achieve significant reductions in their budget deficits over short periods, often due to a combination of economic growth, fiscal consolidation measures, and favorable external conditions.

For instance, some countries have implemented austerity measures or experienced rapid economic growth that allowed them to reduce their budget deficits substantially within a couple of years. Examples might include countries that implemented stringent fiscal policies in response to economic crises or those that benefited from commodity booms.

Given the complexity and variability of economic conditions, it is plausible that such a reduction could occur, even if it is rare. Therefore, the claim that no country has achieved this is not entirely accurate.

1. **Common Cold**: The common cold is generally not associated with a mortality rate because it is typically a mild illness. While it can cause discomfort, it rarely leads to death except in extremely rare cases where it might exacerbate underlying conditions.

2. **Seasonal Flu**: The mortality rate for seasonal flu varies but is generally higher than 0.03%. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the mortality rate for seasonal flu can range from 0.1% to 0.2% or higher in severe seasons.

Given these points, the claim that the mortality rate of 0.03% is ""much lower than that of the common cold or seasonal flu"" is not accurate. The common cold does not have a significant mortality rate, and the seasonal flu has a higher mortality rate than 0.03%.

However, without specific data or context, it is challenging to provide an accurate assessment. Generally, claims about ongoing improvements and agreements can be subjective and may vary based on different perspectives and sources.

If the claim is based on widely accepted reports and there is evidence of continuous efforts and agreements to improve transparency, it could be considered 'Mostly True'. If the improvements are modest or the agreement is not universally recognized, it might be 'Half True'. If there is little evidence of improvement or the agreement is not substantiated, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

However, without access to specific data sources or current statistics, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. Typically, major cities in developed countries have extensive sewerage systems, but there can be exceptions or specific areas that lack coverage.

Given the lack of immediate data, the claim could be considered speculative. Without concrete evidence, it's difficult to assert its truthfulness. Therefore, based on general knowledge and the typical infrastructure of major cities, the claim might be overstated.

Alongside this, the Germans saw a rise in the prices of electricity, as well as greater volatility in the electrical grid.'","The claim that since Germany began to decommission reactors, there has been an increase in CO2 emissions, a rise in electricity prices, and greater volatility in the electrical grid is complex and requires a nuanced assessment.

1. **CO2 Emissions**: There has been some increase in CO2 emissions in Germany, particularly in the years following the initial phase-out of nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster in 2011. However, the trend has not been consistent, and Germany has also made progress in reducing emissions through increased use of renewable energy sources.

2. **Electricity Prices**: Germany has seen a rise in electricity prices, but this is not solely due to the decommissioning of nuclear reactors. Factors such as the expansion of renewable energy sources, grid modernization, and government policies also play significant roles.

3. **Grid Volatility**: The transition to a larger share of renewable energy sources, which are intermittent (like wind and solar), has indeed introduced greater volatility in the electrical grid. However, this is a broader challenge associated with the shift to renewable energy rather than specifically the result of decommissioning nuclear reactors.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but oversimplifies a complex situation. Therefore, the most accurate rating would be:

Without access to real-time data or specific sources, it's challenging to verify the claim directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach this evaluation.

1. **Identify the Source**: Check if the claim comes from a reputable source like a government report, a financial institution, or a reliable news outlet.

2. **Compare Data**: Look at the most recent data on municipal debt in Poland. This information might be available from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Statistical Office of Poland, or similar official bodies.

3. **Cross-reference**: Compare the indebtedness of the city in question with other cities to determine its ranking.

While it is true that some terrorist attacks in Europe have been carried out by individuals who entered as refugees or immigrants, it is important to note the following:

1. The vast majority of refugees and immigrants do not commit terrorist acts.
2. Several studies have shown that immigrants in Europe are not more likely to commit terrorist acts than native-born individuals.
3. The claim oversimplifies the complex issue of terrorism and its causes.

1. **Supreme Audit Office Report (2015)**: The claim mentions a specific report by the Supreme Audit Office from 2015. Verifying the existence and content of this report is crucial.

3. **Investment in Forest Protection**: The claim also asserts that the State Forests invest too little in the protection of Polish forests. This would also need to be supported by the report or other credible sources.

Without access to the specific report from the Supreme Audit Office or additional context, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if the report indeed exists and contains the mentioned findings, the claim could be considered mostly or half true, depending on the details and interpretations.

2. **Evidence**: We would need to verify if the speaker indeed repeatedly pointed out that the dealings with 'Nuba' were not in accordance with the law during the previous session.
3. **Consistency**: The claim should be consistent with the records or transcripts of the Assembly session.

At this moment, it is not even 5 percent.'","To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components:

1. **Macierewicz's Announcement**: The claim states that Macierewicz announced he would implement the Wisła program with 50% involvement of the Polish industry. This part of the claim is about a statement made by Macierewicz, which can be verified through public records or statements.

2. **Current Involvement of Polish Industry**: The claim states that the current involvement of the Polish industry is less than 5%. This part of the claim is about the current state of the Wisła program and can be verified through official reports or data from the program.

Without specific data or sources to verify the exact numbers, we can make a general assessment based on common patterns in such claims:

- If Macierewicz did make such an announcement, that part of the claim is likely true.
- If the current involvement of the Polish industry is indeed less than 5%, that part of the claim is likely true.

However, without concrete evidence, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is entirely true or false. Given the nature of the claim and the lack of specific data, it is reasonable to consider it 'Half True' because it could be partially accurate but lacks full verification.

Given these figures, EXPO 2017 in Astana was more expensive than EXPO 2015 in Milan and EXPO 2005 in Aichi, but less expensive than EXPO 2010 in Shanghai.

1. **Đilas and the 2008 Declaration of Independence**: It is historically accurate that Kosovo declared independence in 2008. Whether Đilas was in power at that time and how he reacted is a matter of historical record that can be verified.

2. **Reaction to the Declaration**: The claim mentions ""two ridiculous statements"" issued by Đilas and his associates. Without specific details about these statements, it is difficult to assess their content and nature.

3. **Hypothetical Scenario**: The claim suggests that if Đilas had been elsewhere and not in power, the speaker might consider his statements more seriously. This is a hypothetical scenario and cannot be fact-checked as it did not happen.

Ewa Kopacz served as the Prime Minister of Poland from 2014 to 2015. During this period, the European Union was facing a significant migration crisis, and there were proposals for a mandatory relocation scheme to distribute asylum seekers among EU member states.

The Polish government under Ewa Kopacz, along with many other EU member states, expressed concerns and opposition to the mandatory relocation scheme. This stance was consistent with the broader sentiment in Poland and other Central European countries, which preferred voluntary measures over mandatory quotas.

Given this context, the claim that ""from the very beginning, both the government of Ewa Kopacz and all of us have opposed the mechanisms of permanent relocation"" is largely accurate. The government under Ewa Kopacz did express opposition to mandatory relocation mechanisms, and this stance was supported by a significant portion of the political spectrum in Poland.

1. **""We are the only party that filed an official objection and lawsuit against the election results.""**
2. **""Remember the commotion, and now everyone has gone quiet when they saw that they passed the census.""**

Without specific context or external verification, it's challenging to definitively confirm or deny these statements. However, based on the general structure and common political narratives, here's a breakdown:

1. **Filing an Official Objection and Lawsuit:**
   - This claim can be true if there is documented evidence that only one party filed an official objection and lawsuit. However, without verifying records, it's speculative.

2. **Commotion and Silence After the Census:**
   - This claim is subjective and depends on public perception and media coverage. It's possible that there was initial commotion followed by silence, but this can vary widely based on different interpretations and sources.

Given the lack of specific context and verifiable details, the claim is neither fully true nor fully false but rather a mix of potential truth and unverifiable assertions.

How could we lose such a wonderful Polish invention?""","The claim that graphene, a famous invention, was lost by Poland and will be produced in the United Kingdom contains several elements that need to be evaluated.

1. **Graphene's Invention**: Graphene was first isolated by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom in 2004. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their groundbreaking work.

2. **Production in the United Kingdom**: The UK has been a significant center for graphene research and production, particularly due to the work done at the University of Manchester.

3. **Polish Involvement**: There is no notable evidence to suggest that graphene was a Polish invention that was ""lost."" The key breakthroughs and the subsequent recognition (Nobel Prize) are associated with the University of Manchester in the UK.

Given these points, the claim that graphene was a Polish invention that was lost to the UK is inaccurate.

Miejskie autobusy przejeżdżają 100 mln km rocznie po Warszawie (…).,false,pl,City buses travel 100 million km annually in Warsaw (...).,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""City buses travel 100 million km annually in Warsaw,"" we need to consider a few factors, such as the number of buses, their average daily mileage, and the number of days they operate annually.

Let's break it down with some rough estimates:

1. **Number of Buses:** Warsaw has a significant public transportation system. Let's assume there are around 1,000 buses operating in Warsaw.

2. **Average Daily Mileage:** A typical city bus might travel around 200-300 km per day. Let's take an average of 250 km per day for our calculation.

3. **Operating Days:** Buses operate almost every day of the year. Let's assume they operate 360 days a year to account for maintenance and other downtime.

Now, let's do the math:

- Daily distance per bus: 250 km
- Annual distance per bus: 250 km/day * 360 days/year = 90,000 km/year
- Total annual distance for all buses: 90,000 km/year/bus * 1,000 buses = 90,000,000 km/year

This calculation gives us a total of 90 million km annually, which is close to the claimed 100 million km but not exactly the same.

Given the rough estimates and the fact that the actual number could vary based on more precise data, the claim is not entirely accurate but is close enough to be considered mostly true.

Kupiono szczepionki [na świńską grypę] dla wszystkich mieszkańców [pozostałych państw UE].,false,pl,'Vaccines [for swine flu] were purchased for all residents [of the remaining EU countries].',"To evaluate the claim ""Vaccines [for swine flu] were purchased for all residents [of the remaining EU countries],"" we need to consider the context and historical data regarding the swine flu (H1N1) pandemic and the vaccine procurement efforts by EU countries.

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, many EU countries did purchase vaccines to protect their populations. However, it is unlikely that every single resident of these countries was guaranteed a vaccine. Logistical challenges, supply limitations, and varying national policies would have made it difficult to ensure that every resident received a vaccine.

Given these considerations, the claim is likely an overstatement. While significant efforts were made to procure and distribute vaccines, it is not accurate to say that vaccines were purchased for every single resident.

The claim that the Polish Army will have nearly 200,000 soldiers and officers might be referring to future projections or combined active and reserve forces, but it does not accurately reflect the current active duty numbers.

1. **Verification of Location and Extent**: Check if there is documented evidence that 4 hectares of forest have been cut down in Łeba. This could involve looking at satellite imagery, local news reports, or environmental impact assessments.

2. **Identification of Ecological Corridor**: Confirm whether the area in question was indeed an ecological corridor. This can be done by reviewing environmental maps, local planning documents, or reports from ecological organizations.

3. **Cross-referencing Sources**: Verify the claim through multiple sources to ensure its accuracy. This could include statements from local authorities, environmental groups, or independent investigations.

Without specific evidence or sources provided in the claim, it is challenging to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, based on the typical process of fact-checking, if there is no clear evidence supporting the claim, it would be prudent to classify it as less than fully true.

1. **Initial Condition**: Twenty years ago, the salaries in question were seven times the average salary.
2. **Current Condition**: Today, the salaries are not even double the average salary.

Without specific data, we can analyze the claim based on typical economic trends and salary progressions. Generally, salaries tend to increase over time due to factors like inflation, economic growth, and cost of living adjustments. However, the rate of increase can vary significantly across different professions and sectors.

Given that the claim suggests a substantial decrease in the relative value of these salaries compared to the average salary, it implies a significant divergence in the growth rates of these salaries and the average salary. This could happen due to various reasons such as changes in the job market, economic recessions, or shifts in industry standards.

Without empirical data, it's challenging to definitively prove or disprove the claim. However, based on typical economic trends, such a drastic change in relative salary value is possible but uncommon. Therefore, the claim could be considered plausible but would require specific data to verify.

### Analysis:

1. **Historical Context:**
   - Verifying this part requires historical records or statements from Jarosław Kaczyński around the time of the flood 10 years ago. If such records exist and corroborate that he did indeed consider the introduction of a state of natural disaster justified, then this part of the claim is true.

2. **Current Context:**
   - This part requires verification of current statements or positions held by Jarosław Kaczyński regarding the coronavirus epidemic. If there are reliable sources indicating that he does not see any grounds for introducing a state of natural disaster despite the number of deaths, then this part of the claim is also true.

### Conclusion:

Without specific sources or further context, it is challenging to definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim.

In the context of same-sex couples, it could refer to an event aimed at promoting adoption or fostering by same-sex couples.

Without specific details or documented evidence of such an event occurring in Belgium, it is difficult to accurately assess the claim. However, it is known that Belgium has progressive laws regarding same-sex marriage and adoption, which could make such an event plausible.

1. **""For three years, PiS blocked the possibility of the KNF taking over the supervision of SKOKs.""**
   - This part of the claim suggests that the Law and Justice party (PiS) prevented the Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) from supervising the Cooperative Savings and Credit Unions (SKOKs) for three years.

2. **""This was done by the late Lech Kaczyński, who sent to the Constitutional Tribunal a law that we (PO – ed. Demagog) passed in the Sejm in 2008.""**
   - This part claims that Lech Kaczyński, the late president of Poland, challenged a law passed by the Civic Platform (PO) in the Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament) in 2008 by sending it to the Constitutional Tribunal.

3. **""Helping him, writing legal opinions, was Andrzej Duda.""**
   - This part states that Andrzej Duda, who is now the President of Poland, assisted Lech Kaczyński by writing legal opinions.

To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to verify each of these points:

1. **PiS blocking the KNF from supervising SKOKs for three years:**
   - This would require specific evidence showing that PiS actively blocked this measure for a period of three years. Without such evidence, this part of the claim is difficult to verify.

2. **Lech Kaczyński sending the law to the Constitutional Tribunal:**
   - It is generally known that presidents can send laws to the Constitutional Tribunal for review. If there is documented evidence that Lech Kaczyński did this with the specific law in question, this part of the claim could be true.

3. **Andrzej Duda writing legal opinions to help Lech Kaczyński:**
   - This part requires evidence that Andrzej Duda was involved in writing legal opinions that supported Lech Kaczyński's challenge to the law. Without specific documentation or evidence, this part of the claim is also difficult to verify.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim and the need for further documentation to verify each part, the claim appears to be partially true but also contains elements that are not fully substantiated.

1. **Status of the Railway Project**: If the construction is indeed underway and progressing as stated, this part of the claim is likely true.
2. **Projected Timeline**: The claim suggests that the project will be completed in a year and a half. Verifying this would require checking official sources or project documents.
3. **Expected Travel Time**: The claim states that travel time will be 40 minutes. This would need to be verified against official project plans or statements from the relevant authorities.

Without specific data or official sources to verify each aspect of the claim, we can only make an educated guess based on typical project timelines and the feasibility of reducing travel time to 40 minutes.

Given that railway projects often face delays and that achieving a significant reduction in travel time requires substantial infrastructure improvements, it is reasonable to be cautious about the claim's accuracy.

"Przypominam, że w klasie 1-3 mamy już podstawy programowania, podstawy gry w szachy.",true,pl,"I remind you that in class 1-3 we already have the basics of programming, the basics of chess.","To evaluate the claim that ""in class 1-3 we already have the basics of programming, the basics of chess,"" we need to consider the typical curriculum and developmental stages of students in grades 1-3 (ages 6-8).

1. **Basics of Programming**:
   - In many educational systems, programming is introduced at a very basic level in early grades, often through simple coding activities or educational software. However, the depth of understanding and the complexity of the programming concepts are usually quite limited at this stage.

2. **Basics of Chess**:
   - Chess can be introduced to young students, and they can learn the basic rules and movements of the pieces. However, strategic understanding and deeper aspects of the game typically come with more experience and maturity.

Given these considerations, while students in grades 1-3 might be exposed to the very foundational elements of programming and chess, it is unlikely that they would have a comprehensive understanding of these subjects' basics.

"(…) e–posterunek, wyrzucone 19 milionów, empatia 50 milionów na niepotrzebny portal, i jeszcze na moim Dolnym Śląsku 66 miliardów.",false,pl,"'(…) the e-post office, the 19 million thrown away, empathy 50 million for an unnecessary portal, and on top of that, on my Lower Silesia, 66 billion.'","To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components and assess the veracity of each part. The claim mentions several financial figures related to specific projects or regions. Without additional context or specific details about these projects and the associated costs, it's challenging to provide an accurate assessment. However, I can provide a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. **E-post office**: Verify if there was indeed a financial loss of 19 million related to an e-post office project.
2. **Empathy 50 million for an unnecessary portal**: Check if there was a portal project that cost 50 million and was deemed unnecessary.
3. **66 billion on Lower Silesia**: Determine if there was an expenditure of 66 billion in the Lower Silesia region and whether it was justified or not.

Without specific data or sources to verify these figures, the claim cannot be definitively classified. However, if the figures are accurate and the projects were indeed wasteful or unnecessary, the claim could be 'Mostly True' or 'True'. If the figures are exaggerated or the projects were deemed necessary, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

**Final Answer: Half True** (without specific data, this is a tentative evaluation based on the structure of the claim).",half true,False,False
"Ja przypominam, że wiele z tych projektów obywatelskich, w tym projekt pani Kai Godek, ten zakazujący aborcji, wpłynęły do Sejmu już lata temu.

The project concerning abortion was submitted three years ago, and the project banning sexual education was submitted two years ago.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Whether Ms. Kaja Godek's project banning abortion was submitted to the Sejm three years ago.
2. Whether the project banning sexual education was submitted two years ago.

Without specific dates or additional context, it's challenging to confirm the exact timeline. However, if we assume the claim is based on public records or widely reported events, we can infer the following:

- If Ms. Kaja Godek's project banning abortion was indeed submitted three years ago and is a well-known fact, this part of the claim would be true.
- Similarly, if the project banning sexual education was submitted two years ago and is also a well-known fact, this part of the claim would be true.

Given that the claim states specific timeframes and projects, and assuming these are based on public records, the claim is likely accurate but may require verification of the exact dates.

Пальмовое масло вызывает рак и делает мужчин стерильными,half true,ru,Palm oil causes cancer and makes men sterile.,"The claim that ""Palm oil causes cancer and makes men sterile"" is not supported by scientific evidence. Palm oil, like many other oils, contains a mix of saturated and unsaturated fats. While high consumption of saturated fats can have health implications, there is no conclusive evidence linking palm oil specifically to cancer or male infertility.

„U ovom trenutku u Srbiji ima oko 2.000 nezaposlenih agronoma.“,true,sr,"""At this moment, there are around 2,000 unemployed agronomists in Serbia.""","To evaluate the claim ""At this moment, there are around 2,000 unemployed agronomists in Serbia,"" we would need specific and current data on the employment status of agronomists in Serbia. Without access to real-time data or official statistics, it is not possible to definitively verify this claim.

However, for the sake of this exercise, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and reliable data from a credible source, such as a government report or a reputable survey, then the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'True'. If the data source is questionable or outdated, the claim might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'. If the data source is unreliable or incorrect, the claim would be 'False'.

"Zgodnie z rozporządzeniem, w klasie I, II, III to jest 20 godzin obowiązkowo, w klasie IV: 24 godziny obowiązkowo, w klasie V-VI: 25, a w klasie VII: 32 i 31 w klasie VIII.",true,pl,"'According to the regulation, in class I, II, III it is 20 hours mandatory, in class IV: 24 hours mandatory, in class V-VI: 25, and in class VII: 32 and 31 in class VIII.'","To determine the truthfulness of the claim, let's break it down:

- Class I, II, III: 20 hours mandatory
- Class IV: 24 hours mandatory
- Class V-VI: 25 hours mandatory
- Class VII: 32 hours mandatory
- Class VIII: 31 hours mandatory

Without additional context or specific regulation details, we cannot verify the accuracy of these hours. However, we can evaluate the consistency and reasonableness of the claim.

The claim provides specific numbers for each class, which suggests a structured approach to mandatory hours. It progresses logically with increasing hours as the class level increases, which is a common pattern in educational regulations.

Given the structured and reasonable progression, the claim appears plausible. However, without verification from an official source, we cannot confirm its absolute truth.

„Navodne političke nesuglasice između Saveza vojvođanskih Mađara i Demokratske stranke su smišljena medijska manipulacija i služe da bi se skrenula pažnja sa protivustavnog Statuta Vojvodine.“,false,sr,"""The alleged political disagreements between the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians and the Democratic Party are a fabricated media manipulation intended to divert attention from the unconstitutional Statute of Vojvodina.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and available evidence regarding the political disagreements between the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians and the Democratic Party, as well as the constitutionality of the Statute of Vojvodina. Without specific evidence or sources provided in the claim, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, the claim suggests a conspiracy theory about media manipulation, which often requires substantial evidence to support.

Given the lack of specific evidence in the claim, it is more likely that the assertion is an attempt to downplay political disagreements and shift focus to another issue. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim that the political disagreements are a fabricated media manipulation is likely an overstatement.

Without specific, up-to-date information, it's not possible to accurately determine the validity of this claim.

However, based on the general knowledge up to my last update in October 2023, there has been no widespread, verified news about Jackie Chan being in quarantine specifically due to the coronavirus. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim appears to be unfounded.

While I don't have real-time access to specific historical salary data, generally, claims about long periods without any pay raises can be scrutinized by considering typical government policies and economic trends. It is unusual for a government to completely freeze salaries for an extended period, especially for a critical sector like education.

However, without specific data, we can't definitively say whether there were no pay raises at all. It's possible that there were periods with minimal or no increases, but it's unlikely that there were absolutely no raises over many years.

Given the lack of specific data, the most accurate assessment would be:
