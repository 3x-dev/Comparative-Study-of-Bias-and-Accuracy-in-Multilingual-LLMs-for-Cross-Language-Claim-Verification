This would typically involve checking reputable news sources, official statements, or interviews where Mahesh Bhatt discusses the trailer of 'Sadak 2'.

If Mahesh Bhatt has publicly expressed his disappointment about the trailer being disliked, then the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If there is no evidence of such a statement from Mahesh Bhatt, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'. If the statement is partially accurate but lacks full context or clarity, it could be considered 'Half True'.

Without specific evidence or context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the typical response to such claims, if Mahesh Bhatt has not made any public statement regarding this, the claim would likely be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Without specific details or context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if the Israeli Prime Minister's son is known to be serving in the military, and the photo accurately portrays him in that capacity, the claim would likely be considered true or mostly true. If there is no evidence supporting the son's military service or if the photo is misleading, the claim would be less accurate.

Given the general nature of the claim and the lack of specific context, it is reasonable to assume that if the son is indeed serving in the military and the photo accurately reflects this, the claim would be:

प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी के संसदीय क्षेत्र वाराणसी में गंगा नदी के घाट गंदगी से भरे हैं.,mostly false,hi,The Ganges river ghats in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency of Varanasi are filled with filth.,"To evaluate the claim ""The Ganges river ghats in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency of Varanasi are filled with filth,"" it is important to consider multiple factors including recent cleanup efforts, current conditions, and ongoing challenges.

Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been a focus of the Namami Gange initiative, which aims to clean the Ganges river and its ghats. Significant efforts have been made to improve the cleanliness and hygiene of the ghats, including waste management, sewage treatment, and public awareness campaigns. However, the cleanliness of the ghats can vary, and there may still be areas that face challenges with waste and pollution.

Given the ongoing efforts and improvements, it is not accurate to say that the ghats are universally ""filled with filth."" However, it is also important to acknowledge that the problem of pollution and waste has not been entirely eradicated.

भारतीय सेना कश्मीरी महिलाओं का उत्पीड़न कर रही है,mostly false,hi,'The Indian Army is oppressing Kashmiri women.',"The claim ""The Indian Army is oppressing Kashmiri women"" is a complex and contentious issue with varying perspectives. Here's a breakdown:

1. **True**: Some human rights organizations and reports (e.g., by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights) have documented cases of human rights abuses, including sexual violence, against Kashmiri women by Indian security forces.

2. **Mostly False/False**: The Indian government and many Indians reject these allegations, arguing that the Indian Army maintains a high level of professionalism and that any isolated incidents are dealt with through internal disciplinary processes. They also point out that the situation in Kashmir is complex due to ongoing militancy and terrorism.

3. **Half True**: While there are documented cases of human rights abuses, it's not accurate to say that the Indian Army as a whole is engaged in a systematic campaign of oppression against Kashmiri women. The situation is more nuanced and complex than the claim suggests.

Considering these points, the claim can be best categorized as:

2. **Credible Sources**: Reputable news outlets or government sources should report on this action.
3. **Context and Evidence**: There should be verifiable evidence of the offensive content posted by B.R. Shetty and the subsequent reaction from the Dubai government.

Without specific evidence or official statements, it is difficult to confirm the claim.

1. **Verification of the Video**: Is there independent verification that the video actually shows West Bengal Police?
2. **Context**: What is the context of the video? When and where was it taken?
3. **Identification of Objects**: Are the objects being thrown actually bombs, or could they be other items like tear gas canisters?
4. **Reliable Sources**: Are there any credible news reports or official statements that corroborate this claim?

Without access to the video or additional context, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on general principles of verification:

- If the video clearly shows West Bengal Police throwing explosive devices, and there is corroborating evidence from reliable sources, the claim could be true.
- If the video is ambiguous or lacks context, or if there are conflicting reports, the claim could be half true or mostly false.
- If the video is proven to be from a different location or event, or if the objects thrown are not bombs, the claim could be false.

Given the lack of specific information, a conservative approach would be to assume that the claim needs further verification before it can be deemed entirely true or false.

1. **Context**: The context in which the image was taken is crucial. It's possible that the image is from a specific event or protest where the placards were used to make a particular point, not necessarily to support China.

2. **Source**: The source of the image and the claim should be evaluated for credibility. If the source is known for spreading misinformation, the claim's credibility decreases.

3. **Historical Positions**: The historical positions of Sitaram Yechury and Brinda Karat on China should be considered. While they are leaders of the CPI-M, which has historical ties with the communist party in China, their views on specific issues related to China may vary.

4. **Direct Evidence**: Without direct evidence, such as statements from Yechury or Karat confirming their support for China in the context of the image, the claim remains unverified.

Given these considerations, without additional context or direct statements, it is misleading to conclude that the image definitively shows support for China. Therefore, the claim is likely exaggerated or misinterpreted.

1. **True**: If the video clearly and accurately depicts women participating in the protest at Shaheen Bagh, without any deceptive edits or misleading context.
2. **Mostly True**: If the video generally shows women in the protest but includes minor inaccuracies or misleading elements that do not significantly alter the overall truth.

1. **Visibility of Ram Setu through satellite imagery**: Ram Setu, also known as Adam’s Bridge, is a chain of limestone shoals between India and Sri Lanka. It is indeed visible through satellite imagery due to its geographical nature.

2. **Impact of reduced pollution on its visibility**: While reduced pollution can generally improve visibility and clarity of images, it is unlikely to significantly affect the visibility of a large geographical feature like Ram Setu, especially when viewed through satellite imagery. Satellite images are typically clear enough to show such features regardless of atmospheric conditions, as they are designed to capture detailed geographical data.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat misleading because it suggests a direct causal relationship between reduced pollution and the visibility of Ram Setu through satellite imagery, which is not accurate. The visibility of Ram Setu through satellite imagery is primarily due to the capabilities of satellite technology rather than changes in environmental pollution.

Since I can't access real-time data or specific tweets, I can't confirm the authenticity of this claim directly. However, I can guide you on how to verify this information:

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look at Benjamin Netanyahu's official Twitter account to see if there was a tweet on June 17 that mentions standing by India's side.
2. **News Reports**: Check credible news sources to see if they reported on such a tweet.
3. **Government Statements**: Sometimes, official statements are also released by the government or the Prime Minister's office, which can be cross-referenced.

Without this verification, the claim remains unconfirmed.

However, the Indian Army does undertake various bridge-building operations across rivers as part of their engineering and disaster relief efforts. Therefore, the claim could be plausible. If the video shows soldiers in Indian Army uniforms and equipment, and the bridge-building techniques align with known Indian Army procedures, the claim could be considered true or mostly true.

1. **Presence of a camera crew**: The presence of a camera crew does not necessarily mean that the event is a 'photo-op'. Media often covers events of political figures, especially when they are engaged in public activities.

2. **Timing of the photo**: The claim mentions that the photo was taken during the mid-cleaning time. This could suggest that the event was not staged for the cameras, as they were present during the activity rather than just at the beginning or end.

3. **Context**: Prime Minister Modi has been known to participate in public cleaning activities as part of his government's Swachh Bharat (Clean India) initiative. This context lends credibility to the event being more than just a photo opportunity.

Based on these points, while the presence of a camera crew might suggest an element of public relations, it does not necessarily mean that the event was solely a 'photo-op'.

1. **True**: If the video clearly shows police officers using force to enforce lockdown rules, and there is corroborating evidence or statements from authorities.
2. **Mostly True**: If the video shows police using force, but the context or extent of the force is somewhat unclear.
3. **Half True**: If the video shows police using force, but there is conflicting information about the circumstances or the necessity of the force.
4. **Mostly False**: If the video is misleading or the context presented is incorrect, but some elements of the claim are accurate.
5. **False**: If the video does not show police using force or if the claim is completely fabricated.

1. **Chanod - The scenic view of Malhar Ghat**: Chanod is indeed known for its scenic views, and Malhar Ghat is a notable location in the area. This part of the claim is likely true.

2. **The Narmada River in its original form**: The Narmada River is one of the major rivers in central India, and it flows through various locations, including areas near Chanod. The phrase ""in its original form"" is somewhat subjective, as rivers can change over time due to natural processes and human activities. However, if we interpret this to mean the river is still flowing and relatively unaltered by major human interventions, it could be considered mostly true.

3. **Salutations to Mother Narmada🙏🏻**: This is a cultural and religious reference, acknowledging the reverence many people have for the Narmada River. This part of the claim is subjective and based on cultural beliefs, but it is a common sentiment among those who hold the river sacred.

Considering all parts of the claim, the overall statement is mostly accurate with some subjective elements.

The RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) is an Indian right-wing, Hindu nationalist, paramilitary volunteer organization. Queen Elizabeth II was the monarch of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms until her death in 2022.

A ""Guard of Honor"" is a ceremonial military or paramilitary formation typically performed by official military or national guard units to honor dignitaries, heads of state, or other important figures.

Given that the RSS is not an official military or national guard unit and does not typically perform such ceremonial duties, especially for foreign heads of state, it is highly unlikely that they would be giving a ""Guard of Honor"" to Queen Elizabeth.

Yesterday, at the rally in Karachi, the flags of India were waved.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the historical context and the events described:

1. **""For 70 years, we were taunted with the flag of Pakistan.""** This part of the claim suggests a long-standing conflict or animosity between two groups, likely related to the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. This historical context is generally accurate, as there have been tensions between India and Pakistan since their independence.

2. **""Yesterday, at the rally in Karachi, the flags of India were waved.""** This part of the claim is more specific and requires verification. Without concrete evidence or reports confirming that Indian flags were indeed waved at a rally in Karachi, it is difficult to ascertain the truthfulness of this statement.

Without additional context or evidence, such as a verified source confirming the picture's origin or independent corroboration, it is not possible to make an accurate assessment.

However, based on the information provided, if there is no concrete evidence supporting the claim, we could consider the following:

- If the picture is somewhat accurate but also contains significant inaccuracies, the claim could be 'Half True'.
- If the picture has major inaccuracies but still bears some resemblance, the claim could be 'Mostly False'.
- If the picture is completely unrelated to Babri Hospital, the claim would be 'False'.

Without specific evidence, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is made without any supporting evidence, a conservative approach would be to consider it 'False' until proven otherwise.

However, without specific context or evidence to support what ""cross the bottle of liquor"" actually refers to in this political context, it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the claim.

Given the lack of clarity and specific evidence, the most appropriate classification would be:

कोई भी यकीन नहीं करेगा कि यह आज से सदियों पहले 1063 ईसवी में बनाया गया था ।,half true,gu,No one will believe that this was created centuries ago in 1063 AD.,"To evaluate the claim ""No one will believe that this was created centuries ago in 1063 AD,"" we need to consider whether the statement is factually accurate or an opinion. The claim is an opinion about what people will believe, rather than a statement of fact. Since it's an opinion, it can't be objectively classified as true or false. However, for the sake of this exercise, we'll interpret the task as evaluating the likelihood of the opinion being widely accepted.

Given that the claim is about people's beliefs rather than a verifiable fact, it leans more towards subjectivity. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be 'Half True,' acknowledging that while some people might find it hard to believe, others might not.

The claim suggests that in the Gujarat Model, weekly payments are being extorted from laborers walking on the railway tracks. This is a serious allegation that implies systematic corruption or exploitation.

Without specific evidence or sources to corroborate this claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. The term ""Gujarat Model"" is often used in political and economic discussions to refer to a particular approach to governance and development, but it does not inherently imply extortion or illegal activities.

Given the lack of supporting evidence and the serious nature of the allegation, the claim appears to be speculative or potentially misleading. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is likely exaggerated or unfounded.

Without watching the specific video in question, we cannot definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, based on general knowledge and historical events, it is known that there have been instances of clashes between Chinese and Indian soldiers.

For a precise evaluation, we would need to verify the authenticity and content of the video. If the video indeed shows Chinese soldiers attacking Indian soldiers, the claim could be considered true or mostly true. If the video does not accurately depict such an event, the claim could be considered mostly false or false.

1. **Verifiability**: Is there concrete evidence, such as credible news reports or verifiable sources, that confirm this event took place?
2. **Context**: Are there details about when and where this procession occurred, and who organized it?
3. **Authenticity of the Video**: Is the video authentic and does it clearly show Indians in Spain taking out a procession in support of the Ram Temple?

Without specific evidence or sources to verify the claim, it's difficult to definitively say whether the event happened as described. The claim could be partially true if there was indeed a procession, but the motivation or details might be exaggerated or misrepresented.

Given the lack of verifiable information, the most accurate assessment would be:

It's implausible that every person in India holds this comparison, as public opinion is typically diverse. Additionally, comparing a leader to Hitler is a highly charged and controversial statement that is not likely to be universally held.

सरकार कर्मचारियों की पेंशन 30 फीसदी तक कम करने जा रही है.,mostly false,hi,The government is planning to reduce the pension of employees by up to 30 percent.,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we would need to verify it against recent government announcements, official documents, or credible news sources. Without specific context or evidence, it's impossible to definitively categorize the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have conducted thorough research and found the following:

- There have been discussions about pension reforms.
- Some proposals suggest reductions, but none specifies a 30% cut.
- The majority of proposals focus on other cost-saving measures rather than direct cuts.

Given this hypothetical context, the claim would likely be categorized as 'Mostly False' because while there might be discussions about pension reforms, the specifics of a 30% reduction are not supported by available information.

Without additional context, the statement appears vague and could be interpreted in multiple ways. However, if we assume the claim is about the appropriateness or practicality of presenting Narendra Modi as a specific educational step or example for schoolchildren, we would need more information to determine its accuracy.

Given the lack of context, it's challenging to definitively classify this claim. However, based on the available information, it seems like a matter of opinion or interpretation rather than a factual statement that can be verified as true or false.

Mother Teresa was 18 years old in 1928, and it's unlikely that many photographs exist from that period of her life. Most of the well-known images of Mother Teresa are from her later years after she founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950.

The claim suggests that Rahul Gandhi's meeting with migrant workers was sponsored and that a woman in a photo with him was later seen leaving in a car.

1. **Sponsored Meeting**: Without specific evidence that the meeting was sponsored, this part of the claim is speculative and cannot be verified as true or false based on the information provided.

2. **Woman Leaving in a Car**: Seeing a woman leave in a car does not necessarily imply that the meeting was sponsored. People can leave events in cars for various reasons, including personal convenience or transportation needs.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to support the claim that the meeting was sponsored and the neutrality of the observation about the woman leaving in a car, the claim appears to be largely unsubstantiated.

1. **Verification of the Photo**: The authenticity of the photo needs to be confirmed. It could be a genuine photo or a misrepresentation.
2. **Official Reports**: Checking official reports from the Indian Army or government sources would provide credible information.
3. **Media Coverage**: Cross-referencing with reputable media outlets that cover the incident.

The claim accompanying the photo states that the plane was built for Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a cost of 8600 crores.',"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider several factors, including credible sources, official statements, and verifiable information.

1. **Official Statements**: The Indian government typically provides details on such high-profile expenditures. If the claim were true, there would likely be official press releases or statements.

2. **Media Reports**: Reputable media sources would have reported on an expenditure of this magnitude, especially if it were for a high-profile figure like the Prime Minister.

3. **Fact-Checking Websites**: Organizations dedicated to fact-checking often investigate viral claims and provide detailed analysis.

Without specific details or verifiable sources, it's challenging to conclusively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, given the lack of widespread, credible reports corroborating this claim, it is likely exaggerated or false.

Barcodes starting with '690' to '699' are indeed assigned to China, but '890' is not assigned to India. India's country code for barcodes is '890'. However, '890' is also used by other countries in that region. Therefore, the claim is partially correct but not entirely accurate.

This includes verifying the authenticity of the photos, the context in which they were taken, and corroborating the claims with reliable news reports and statements from relevant authorities.

Without access to specific photos or additional context, it is not possible to definitively label the claim. However, based on general principles of fact-checking, here's a hypothetical approach:

1. **Verify the Source**: Check if the photos are from a credible source or if they have been manipulated.
2. **Cross-Reference**: Look for reports from multiple credible news outlets that corroborate the claim.
3. **Context**: Ensure the photos are not being used out of context or from a different time or place.
4. **Official Statements**: Check for statements from BJP officials, local authorities, or independent fact-checking organizations.

2. Whether the new traffic law requires the use of helmets for scooter riders.

Without specific evidence or context regarding the first point (e.g., a verified photo or video), we cannot confirm if Nitin Gadkari rode a scooter without a helmet. The second point is generally true, as most traffic laws in India do require helmets for two-wheeler riders, including scooters.

1. **Procedural Standards**: Postmortem examinations, also known as autopsies, are conducted on deceased individuals to determine the cause of death. They are governed by strict protocols and legal requirements.

2. **Medical Ethics**: Removing organs from a living person without their consent or under false pretenses is a severe violation of medical ethics and legal standards. It would result in criminal charges and loss of medical licenses for the practitioners involved.

Given these considerations, if the video accurately depicts the closure of New Zealand's corona ward and this is confirmed by official sources, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If there are discrepancies or a lack of official confirmation, the claim could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

2. **Visual Comparison**: Comparing two images without knowing the conditions, such as time of day, season, or specific location along the Ganga, does not provide a reliable basis for comparison.

3. **Political Claim**: The claim attributes the condition of the Ganga to specific political parties or leaders. This is a simplistic attribution that overlooks the complex and long-term nature of environmental changes, which are influenced by numerous factors beyond political rule.

4. **Scientific Data**: To accurately assess the state of the Ganga, scientific data on pollution levels, water quality, and environmental health over time would be necessary.

Given these points, the claim that the condition of the Ganga can be directly attributed to specific political regimes based on two photos is highly dubious and lacks sufficient evidence to be considered accurate.

1. ""After the elephant, now a pregnant cow's jaw was fractured after being fed explosives.""
2. ""If this is what humans do, they do not deserve to live - the earth may well swallow everyone.""

Let's break down each part:

1. **""After the elephant, now a pregnant cow's jaw was fractured after being fed explosives.""**
   - This part of the claim suggests that there have been incidents where animals, specifically an elephant and a pregnant cow, have been harmed by being fed explosives. Without specific, verified reports or evidence, it is difficult to determine the truthfulness of this claim. News articles or official reports would be necessary to confirm these incidents.

2. **""If this is what humans do, they do not deserve to live - the earth may well swallow everyone.""**
   - This part of the claim is an opinion or a moral judgment rather than a factual statement. It expresses a strong sentiment about the mistreatment of animals and the consequences of such actions.

Given the lack of specific, verifiable evidence for the first part of the claim and the subjective nature of the second part, the overall claim cannot be definitively classified as 'True' or 'False'. It falls somewhere in the middle, as it contains an element of potential truth (if the incidents are real) mixed with opinion.

The Farm Ordinance Bill was passed in September 2020. If the photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bhagwant Mann laughing together is claimed to be from after this event, we need to verify if there is any evidence supporting this timeline.

Without specific evidence or reliable sources confirming that the photo was indeed taken after the passage of the Farm Ordinance Bill, it is difficult to validate the claim. Misattribution of photos to different events is common on social media.

1. **Heavy Rainfall in Mumbai**: This can be verified through weather reports and news articles. If multiple credible sources confirm heavy rainfall, this part is likely true.

2. **Waterlogging Everywhere**: This is a bit more subjective. ""Everywhere"" suggests a widespread issue. If news reports and official statements indicate significant waterlogging in various parts of the city, this part could be considered mostly true.

3. **Sealink Area Submerged in Water**: This can be verified through visual evidence, news reports, or statements from authorities. If there is substantial evidence showing the Sealink area submerged, this part is likely true.

Given that all three parts need to be considered:

- If heavy rainfall and significant waterlogging are confirmed by multiple sources, and there is evidence of the Sealink area being submerged, the claim would be mostly true.
- If there is evidence of heavy rainfall and waterlogging but not specifically in the Sealink area, the claim would be half true.

While it is possible to construct simple, temporary, or prefabricated bridges in a short time frame, building a substantial, permanent bridge typically takes much longer due to planning, permitting, and construction processes.

Without specific details about the type, size, and location of the bridge, it's challenging to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

First, let's clarify that Sitaram Yechury is a prominent leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M). The claim suggests that he made a specific reference to Xi Jinping, the President of China, in a derogatory or submissive manner.

Without access to the specific tweet or verification from reliable sources, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of this claim. However, such a statement would be highly unusual and controversial, given Yechury's political position and the context of Indian politics.

1. **Verify the Source**: Check if the pictures come from a reliable source. Are they from a reputable news agency, a verified social media account, or an eyewitness with a credible background?

2. **Cross-Reference with Other Sources**: Look for corroborating reports from multiple reliable news outlets, human rights organizations, or official statements.

Without specific evidence or context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the information typically available in public records and media reports, here is a general approach to evaluating the claim:

1. **Official Statements**: Check if Bhagwant Mann has made any official statements regarding Dera Sacha Sauda.
2. **Media Reports**: Look for reputable news articles or interviews where Mann might have commented on the subject.
3. **Social Media**: Review Mann's social media platforms for any relevant posts.

असम में एनआरसी लागू होने के बाद पुलिस द्वारा लोगों को उनके घर से निकालने का वीडियो.,false,hi,'Video of police evicting people from their homes in Assam after the implementation of NRC.',"To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to consider several factors, including the context of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, the actions taken by authorities, and the evidence presented in the video.

1. **Context of NRC in Assam**: The NRC is a register maintained by the Government of India containing names and certain relevant information for the purpose of citizen identification. The process in Assam has been contentious, with many people being excluded from the list, raising concerns about statelessness and potential deportation.

2. **Evictions and Police Actions**: There have been reports of authorities taking action against those excluded from the NRC, which could include evictions. However, these actions are often part of broader legal processes and not necessarily arbitrary evictions.

3. **Verification of Video**: Without specific verification of the video in question, it is difficult to ascertain whether it accurately depicts police evicting people due to the NRC. Video evidence can be misleading if taken out of context or misrepresented.

Given these points, the claim that a video shows police evicting people from their homes in Assam after the implementation of NRC could be partially true but requires more context and verification. The actions might be related to NRC, but the specifics of the evictions and the legitimacy of the video need further scrutiny.

If such a claim were found to be substantiated by these authorities, it would be widely reported in the media.

2. **Corroborate with Other Sources**: Look for multiple independent reports of the incident from reputable news outlets.
3. **Check Official Statements**: See if there are any official statements from police, government officials, or Sidhu himself regarding the incident.

Generally, high-profile individuals like Prime Ministers may have highly skilled and well-paid staff, but the specific figure of 15 lakh rupees per month for a makeup artist is unusually high and lacks supporting evidence.

The Christchurch mosque attacks occurred in March 2019 and had a profound impact on New Zealand society.

According to various news reports and statements from Islamic organizations in New Zealand, there was indeed an increase in interest in Islam and some conversions following the attacks. However, the specific number of conversions can be difficult to verify precisely due to the nature of religious conversion data.

Some sources, such as the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, reported a significant increase in conversions, but the exact number of 350 is not universally corroborated by all sources. The claim is based on anecdotal evidence and statements from certain Islamic leaders, which suggest a notable increase in conversions but do not provide a definitive count.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Human Rights Reports**: International and national human rights organizations often publish reports on the state of human rights in different regions. These reports can provide insights into whether oppression has occurred.

2. **Freedom of Speech**: Assessments by organizations like Reporters Without Borders can indicate the level of freedom of speech and press in BJP-ruled states.

3. **Civil Liberties**: Reports from organizations like Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch can provide data on civil liberties and any instances of oppression.

4. **Treatment of Minorities**: Reports on the treatment of religious, ethnic, and other minorities can also provide evidence of oppression.

5. **Legal and Judicial Systems**: The functioning of the legal and judicial systems in addressing cases of oppression is another important factor.

Without specific data or reports, it is challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, if we consider a balanced view based on various reports and analyses, it is likely that there have been instances of oppression reported in some BJP-ruled states, but the extent and prevalence may vary.

2. **Context and Evidence**: Without specific evidence, such as verified news reports, eyewitness accounts, or official statements, it is difficult to substantiate the claim.

3. **Historical and Political Context**: Kashmir has been a region of political and social unrest, and there have been allegations of human rights violations. However, attributing specific actions to a particular group without concrete proof is problematic.

4. **Credibility of the Claim**: The claim involves a serious accusation of abduction and impersonation of military personnel. Such claims require robust evidence to be considered credible.

1. **The video is of Bhushi Dam in Lonavala:** This part of the claim can be verified by checking the contents of the video. If the video indeed shows Bhushi Dam in Lonavala, then this part is true.

2. **If people keep talking like this, coronavirus will not leave India:** This part of the claim is an opinion and not a fact. The spread of coronavirus is influenced by numerous factors such as public health measures, vaccination rates, and individual behaviors, not by people talking in a certain way. Therefore, this part of the claim is false.

Given that one part is potentially true and the other is false, the overall claim is a mix of truth and falsehood.

दिल्ली में NPR और NRC के विरोध में मुस्लिमों की रैली का वीडियो,mostly false,hi,'Video of Muslim rally in Delhi against NPR and NRC'.,"To accurately assess the claim ""Video of Muslim rally in Delhi against NPR and NRC,"" we would need to verify the actual content of the video and the context in which it was recorded. Here are some steps to consider for verification:

1. **Source Verification**: Check the credibility of the source that published the video. Reliable news outlets and verified social media accounts are more trustworthy.

2. **Date and Location**: Ensure the video was taken in Delhi and during a timeframe when protests against NPR (National Population Register) and NRC (National Register of Citizens) were occurring.

3. **Participants and Slogans**: Look for identifiable symbols, banners, or slogans that confirm the participants are protesting against NPR and NRC.

4. **Cross-Referencing**: Compare the video with other news reports or videos from the same event to corroborate the details.

Without access to the actual video and additional context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, assuming the video accurately depicts a Muslim rally in Delhi against NPR and NRC, and this can be corroborated by reliable sources, the claim would likely be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

Without specific context or a reliable source to verify the claim, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge and typical government responses to such situations, it is unlikely that such a specific and high amount would be allocated for each COVID-19 patient without widespread public knowledge or official documentation.

1. **Verification of the Video**: Is the video authentic and not manipulated?
2. **Identity of the Individual**: Is the person in the video actually the son of a prominent BJP leader?
3. **Context of the Event**: Did the incident occur on the reality show Dance India Dance?
4. **Credibility of the Source**: Is the source of the video and the claim reliable?

Without specific details about the authenticity of the video, the identity of the individual, and the context of the event, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general guidelines for evaluating such claims:

- If the video is authentic and the individual is confirmed to be the son of a prominent BJP leader, and the incident occurred on Dance India Dance, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If some aspects are verified but others are unclear, the claim could be 'Half True'.
- If the video is manipulated, the individual is misidentified, or the context is incorrect, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific details to verify the claim, the most cautious approach would be to consider it 'Half True' until further evidence is provided.

গুগল ভারতীয় মানচিত্র থেকে নিয়ন্ত্রণ রেখা সরিয়ে দিয়েছে,mostly false,bn,'Google has removed the control line from the Indian map.',"To determine the validity of the claim that ""Google has removed the control line from the Indian map,"" we need to consider the context and historical accuracy of such a claim. The control line, often referred to as the Line of Control (LoC), is a military control line between the Indian and Pakistani-controlled parts of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.

Google Maps and other mapping services typically display disputed borders in a neutral manner, often using dotted or dashed lines to indicate areas of contention. While Google may update its maps based on geopolitical changes or new data, it is unlikely that they would entirely remove a significant geopolitical feature like the Line of Control without substantial reason or widespread international recognition.

Given that there is no widely reported or verified information suggesting that Google has removed the control line from the Indian map, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated.

However, generally speaking, it is unusual for a country to operate without taking any loans from international financial institutions like the World Bank for a prolonged period, especially if it is a developing nation.

2. **No New Patients in Malegaon**: The claim that no new patients have been found in Malegaon would need to be supported by official health data from reliable sources. Without such data, this part of the claim cannot be verified.

Given the lack of scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of Unani medicine in curing COVID-19 and the absence of reliable data to support the claim of no new patients, the overall claim is highly dubious.

2. **Cross-Reference**: Look for other reports or videos that corroborate the scene at Sassoon Hospital.
3. **Geolocation**: Confirm that the location in the video matches Sassoon Hospital in Pune.
4. **Timestamp**: Ensure the video is recent and not old footage being misrepresented.

If after these checks you find that the video is authentic and correctly represents the situation at Sassoon Hospital in Pune, the claim would likely be 'True' or 'Mostly True.' If there are discrepancies or the video is misleading, it could be 'Half True,' 'Mostly False,' or 'False.'

1. **Plausibility**: Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth and can be found in various oceans. It is not uncommon for researchers and photographers to use helicopters to observe and document marine life, including blue whales.

2. **Technological Feasibility**: Using helicopters for aerial photography is a well-established practice. Helicopters provide a stable platform for capturing high-quality images from above.

3. **Scientific and Practical Context**: There are numerous documented instances of aerial photography being used to study and photograph blue whales. This includes scientific research, wildlife documentaries, and nature photography.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is likely true. Therefore, the photograph described in the claim is feasible and plausible.

Explanation: The claim contains several exaggerations and inaccuracies that make it implausible. The longest anaconda ever recorded was around 17 feet, and the weights reported for large anacondas are typically in the hundreds of pounds, not thousands.

1. **Public Health Guidelines**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, public figures, including government officials, are expected to adhere to public health guidelines, which often include social distancing and limiting non-essential activities.
2. **Public Perception and Security**: Prime Ministers typically have security protocols that would make casual shopping in public markets less likely.
3. **Media Reports**: There have been no widely reported instances of Boris Johnson shopping in public markets during the pandemic.

Given these considerations, the claim that Boris Johnson is shopping in the market like a common citizen during the pandemic is unlikely to be true.

However, without specific evidence or corroborating sources, claims of collusion and EVM tampering are often speculative.

In general, allegations of such serious malfeasance would require substantial proof, such as eyewitness accounts, official investigations, or documentary evidence. The Election Commission of India has strict protocols in place to ensure the integrity of the electoral process, including the security and storage of EVMs.

If the majority of sources refute the claim, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

बिकनी पहने हुए महिलाओं के साथ अमेरिका के राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप का वीडियो.,false,hi,'Video of US President Donald Trump with women in bikinis.',"To evaluate the claim ""Video of US President Donald Trump with women in bikinis,"" it's important to consider the context and verifiable evidence. Donald Trump has a well-documented history in the entertainment industry, including his ownership of the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants. During these pageants, contestants often wore bikinis, and Trump was photographed and filmed with them.

Given this context, it is accurate to say that there are videos and images of Donald Trump with women in bikinis from his time as a pageant owner. However, the claim could be misleading if it implies inappropriate behavior or a specific context outside of these pageants without further evidence.

However, without access to the specific viral post or the images in the collage, it is difficult to provide a precise evaluation. The term ""helpless"" is subjective and could be interpreted in various ways, such as lack of authority, influence, or independence.

In general, as the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind holds a ceremonial position with limited executive powers. The Indian Constitution vests most executive powers in the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, who are typically the leaders of the ruling party (in this case, the BJP). Therefore, it is true that the President's role is largely ceremonial and they are expected to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers.

Without additional context or evidence, it is challenging to label the claim as entirely true or false. However, based on the constitutional role of the President, it could be argued that the claim is somewhat accurate but may be exaggerated or misinterpreted.

Without specific evidence or context, it is challenging to ascertain the truthfulness of the claim.

Such claims often circulate without substantial evidence and are typically debunked by fact-checking organizations.

Proud of Deepika Padukone!

For instance, whether a move by the Queen is ""fitting"" or whether one should be ""proud"" of Deepika Padukone is a matter of personal opinion. Additionally, the statement about India's government is a broad and subjective political critique that lacks specific, verifiable details.

1. **Technological Feasibility**: Drones capable of carrying small payloads, such as a package of noodles, do exist. Several companies have experimented with drone delivery for various items, including food.

2. **Video Authenticity**: Without viewing the specific video, it's difficult to definitively say whether it's real or not. However, with modern technology, creating convincing fake videos is possible.

3. **Context**: If the video comes from a reputable source or a company known for testing drone delivery, it's more likely to be real. If it's from an unknown source or lacks context, it's more likely to be fake or misleading.

Given these factors, it's reasonable to say that while drone delivery of noodles is technically possible, the authenticity of the specific video in question can't be confirmed without more information. Therefore, the claim is 'Half True'.

1. **Check Official Statements**: Look for any official announcements from Tejashwi Yadav or his party regarding his travel plans.
2. **News Reports**: Review recent news articles from credible sources that cover Tejashwi Yadav's activities.
3. **Social Media**: Check Tejashwi Yadav's official social media accounts for any updates or posts related to his plans.

If there is no credible information supporting this claim, it would be considered 'False'. If partial information supports some aspects but not others, it might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'. If the claim is fully supported by reliable sources, it would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

Without specific details or reliable sources, it is challenging to conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim.

However, based on general knowledge and typical reporting standards, here are some considerations:

1. **Context**: The claim suggests that Dharmendra was directly affected by protesters against the CAA. This could mean he was injured, killed, or otherwise harmed during these protests.
2. **Verification**: To confirm the claim, we would need to check official reports, news articles, or statements from the CRPF or other reliable sources.
3. **Accuracy**: If there is no verifiable information linking Dharmendra's situation to the CAA protests, the claim would be considered unfounded.

Without specific details or sources, the claim cannot be definitively labeled as true or false. Therefore, the most cautious approach is to consider it unverified or lacking sufficient evidence.

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) have been controversial topics in India, and there have been various protests and incidents related to them.

However, without concrete evidence or reliable sources confirming that a specific suicide was directly linked to protesting the NRC and CAA, it is difficult to label the claim as entirely true or false.

Without the actual photo or additional context, it is challenging to determine the veracity of the claim. However, it is known that Italy was severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, and there have been numerous reports and images related to the impact of the virus, including funerals and last rites.

To provide an accurate assessment, one would need to:
1. Verify the source of the photo.
2. Check if the photo has been confirmed by reputable news organizations.
3. Ensure that the context of the photo matches the claim.

Given the general knowledge of the pandemic's impact in Italy, it is plausible that such photos exist. However, without specific verification, a cautious approach is warranted.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have checked reliable sources and found the following:

- If official reports confirm that there are indeed 196 suspected cases of COVID-19 in Bikaner, Rajasthan, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there are approximately 196 cases, with a slight discrepancy, it could be 'Mostly True'.
- If the number is significantly different but still indicates a high number of suspected cases, it might be 'Half True'.
- If the number is much lower or higher, it would be 'Mostly False'.
- If there are no such cases reported, the claim would be 'False'.

While it is possible for a father to find alternative methods such as using formula or finding a wet nurse, the claim suggests an ""extraordinary way,"" which might imply something unusual or beyond typical methods.

Without specific context or evidence, it's difficult to verify the claim accurately. However, based on general knowledge, fathers can certainly find ways to feed their babies after the mother's death, but these methods are typically well-known and not necessarily extraordinary.

As of my last update in October 2023, the statement refers to a specific timeline for the availability of Covishield, India's first coronavirus vaccine. However, without a specific date or year attached to the claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy based on current knowledge.

If the claim was made prior to the actual release of Covishield, it would be necessary to check the historical records to see if the vaccine was indeed made available within the specified timeframe. Covishield was developed by the Serum Institute of India in collaboration with AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and it was approved for emergency use in India in early January 2021.

Given the lack of a specific date for the claim, it is challenging to definitively classify it as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

This involves checking credible news sources, official statements, and possibly contacting the party or the leader in question.

However, without access to real-time information or the capability to verify the video directly, I can provide a general guideline on how to approach such a claim:

1. **Check Credible News Sources**: Look for reports from reliable news outlets that have covered the story.
2. **Official Statements**: Check for any official statements from Davinder Singh Sidhu Bihla or the Shiromani Akali Dal.
3. **Social Media Verification**: Review the video on social media platforms and check for comments or context that might provide more information.

This requires access to reliable sources and the specific article or statement in question.

Without the specific details of the comments and the context, it is not possible to provide a precise evaluation. However, based on typical standards for evaluating claims:

- If Amit Shah did make comments that were widely perceived as controversial and these comments were reported in Anandabazar Patrika, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True.'

If there is evidence supporting that Aishi Ghosh has indeed been injured on both hands as described, the claim could be considered true.

2. **Deployment in Ladakh**: There have been reports of Apache helicopters being deployed in the Ladakh region, particularly in areas near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, including Pangong Tso.

Without access to such sources, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of the claim.

However, if we assume that credible sources have reported this information, the claim could be considered true.

Without specific evidence to support the claim that Muslims in Delhi's Patparganj are completely disregarding the rules of the coronavirus lockdown, it is not advisable to assume the claim is entirely true.

राष्ट्रपति रामनाथ कोविंद बीजेपी के बड़े नेताओं के सामने मजबूर हैं.,mostly false,hi,'President Ram Nath Kovind is helpless before the big leaders of the BJP.',"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the role and powers of the President of India as outlined in the Constitution. The President of India, including Ram Nath Kovind, is largely a ceremonial head of state. The President's actions are typically guided by the advice of the Council of Ministers, led by the Prime Minister, who is usually the leader of the ruling party (in this case, the BJP).

However, describing the President as ""helpless"" is subjective and can be misleading. While it is true that the President's actions are largely guided by the government, the President also has certain discretionary powers and can, in exceptional circumstances, act independently.

Given these nuances, the claim is not entirely accurate but does contain elements of truth.

Without access to the actual pictures or additional context, I cannot definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim.

However, I can provide guidance on how to assess the claim:

1. **Check the Source**: Verify the source of the pictures. Are they from a credible news organization or a reliable witness?
2. **Cross-Reference**: Compare the pictures with other news reports and images from the incident. Multiple sources reporting the same images add credibility.
3. **Metadata and EXIF Data**: Check the metadata of the images to see if they match the time and location of the incident.
4. **Reverse Image Search**: Use a reverse image search to see if the pictures have been used in other contexts or if they are from a different event.

Without these steps, it is difficult to make an informed judgment. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim is unverifiable.

1. The date the photo was taken (July 20th of this year).
2. The location where the photo was taken (Uri Kamalkote area of the Baramulla district of Kashmir).

Without access to the actual photo or additional context, it is impossible to verify the claim accurately. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have the necessary tools and information to verify these details.

If the photo metadata, reliable sources, or witness accounts confirm both the date and location, then the claim would be true. If there are minor discrepancies but the overall claim holds, it might be considered mostly true. If significant aspects are unverifiable or partially inaccurate, it could be half true. If most details are incorrect, it would be mostly false, and if the entire claim is fabricated, it would be false.

For the purpose of this example, let's assume we have verified the metadata of the photo and confirmed witness accounts that support the claim.

1. **The image and its symbolism**: The claim states that a woman wrapped her entire body in barbed wire to send a message about women's safety.
2. **The message**: The claim suggests that this action is a protest against the BJP government, highlighting increasing rape incidents across India.

Ahmad Javed, who served as the Commissioner of Mumbai Police, is known for his dedication and integrity, and the claim about his symbolic salary of one rupee has been a part of his public image.

Without access to real-time data or specific details about the event, we cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have conducted a thorough investigation using reliable sources.

However, based on the information provided in the claim itself, it's impossible to determine its veracity without additional details. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **True**: If there is indeed a video showing passengers arguing with an attendant about social distancing on an Air India flight, and the context is accurately described.
2. **Mostly True**: If the video exists and generally shows the described scene, but some details might be slightly exaggerated or inaccurate.
3. **Half True**: If the video exists but the context is significantly different, or if the video is from a different airline or incident.
4. **Mostly False**: If the video is heavily edited or taken out of context, or if the incident did not occur as described.
5. **False**: If no such video exists or the incident never occurred.

Without viewing the video or having more context, we cannot accurately label the claim. Therefore, based on the information given:

Without verifying the authenticity of the picture and the incident it references, it's challenging to provide an absolute answer. However, based on general knowledge and reported events, the Galwan Valley clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in June 2020 is a well-documented incident where several soldiers from both sides were injured and some lost their lives. Therefore, if the picture accurately depicts an Indian soldier injured during that event, the claim could be considered valid.

Without such details, it's challenging to provide an accurate assessment. However, based on general knowledge, Shahrukh Khan does own a well-known residence called ""Mannat"" in Mumbai, India.

If the claim is referring to ""Mannat,"" it would be accurate. If the claim is about a different building without verification, it would be less accurate.

However, it is important to verify such claims with reliable sources. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there have been incidents and tensions between India and China in Ladakh, but no major report indicates the death of 75 Indian soldiers in a single event or a series of events.

Dubai is known for its diverse population and there have been instances of interfaith events and cultural exchanges. However, singing Hindu devotional songs (Ram Bhajan) in a mosque is highly unusual and would typically be considered inappropriate due to the religious sensitivities involved.

Without specific evidence or a reliable source confirming that this event took place, the claim appears unlikely. Therefore, the most accurate classification of this claim would be:

This requires fact-checking and verifying the incident through reliable news outlets, police reports, or other official documentation.

Without specific details such as names, dates, or locations, it is difficult to substantiate the claim. Often, such claims circulate without verifiable sources and may be exaggerated or fabricated to spread misinformation.

Given the lack of specific, verifiable information, and without credible sources to back up the claim, it is reasonable to consider the statement as unproven and potentially misleading.

Without specific evidence, such as videos, news reports, or eyewitness accounts, it's difficult to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, it is plausible that a group of people, including foreigners, could dance to a popular song in a public place like London.

Without specific details such as the date of the match, the names of the players involved, or a reliable source confirming the incident, it is difficult to verify the claim accurately.

However, professional cricket teams, especially those representing their countries in high-stakes matches like India vs. Pakistan, are typically under strict codes of conduct and would not engage in activities that could negatively impact their performance or reputation.

Given the lack of specific evidence and the general professional conduct expected of national cricket teams, the claim appears to be unfounded.

1. The claim states that ""The mother could not bear the burden of her young son's departure.""
2. It also states that ""Anurag's mother passed away due to a heart attack.""

Without additional context or evidence, it is difficult to definitively confirm the emotional state of Anurag's mother leading up to her heart attack or the direct cause of the heart attack. The claim implies a causal relationship between the son's departure and the mother's heart attack, but this relationship is not explicitly proven in the statement.

2. The impact of Manoj Tiwari's video of going to the mosque on the BJP's electoral prospects.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, let's break down the claim:

- **The condition of BJP in Haryana elections**: This is subjective and depends on various factors such as poll predictions, political analysts' views, and actual election results.
- **Manoj Tiwari's video impact**: The impact of a single video on the overall electoral outcomes is typically difficult to quantify and would require empirical data or surveys.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to support the claim that the BJP's condition in the Haryana elections is dire specifically due to Manoj Tiwari's video, the claim seems exaggerated or speculative.

2. The reach and influence of PM Modi's appeal outside of India, specifically in Brazil.
3. Evidence of Brazilian people responding to and acting on this appeal.

Without specific evidence or data to support the claim that people in Brazil acted on PM Modi's appeal, it is challenging to verify its accuracy. Generally, PM Modi's appeals are primarily directed towards the Indian population, and their impact outside of India, especially in countries like Brazil, would be limited unless there is a significant Indian diaspora or specific international campaign.

The Burj Khalifa is a well-known landmark in Dubai and attracts millions of visitors each year. While it is possible that various historical figures and notable individuals are featured in the building, specific details about every person or item displayed are not typically widely documented.

Given the lack of specific details or evidence in the claim, it is more likely to be 'False' or 'Mostly False' unless supported by credible sources.

2. **Viral Status**: Can the video be confirmed to have gone viral?

Without specific details about which stadium is being referred to or data on the video's virality, it's challenging to conclusively verify the claim. However, if we assume that a stadium like the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (often considered one of the largest) is being referred to, and if there is a video circulating widely, the claim could be partly true.

Without specific real-time information or access to current news databases, I cannot confirm the authenticity of this claim. Typically, such initiatives are announced through official government channels or reputable news sources. If you can provide a source or more context, it would help in verifying the claim.

However, based on general knowledge of government initiatives during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, it is plausible that such a measure could be taken to assist stranded workers.

This involves checking reliable news sources, official statements, or fact-checking websites that have covered the incident. Without access to real-time data or specific news articles, we cannot definitively confirm the truthfulness of the claim.

However, for the sake of explanation, let's consider the steps typically involved in verifying such a claim:

1. **Check Official Statements**: Look for statements from Rajkumar Saini, the BJP, or any official authorities involved.
2. **Review News Reports**: Search for coverage of the incident in reputable news outlets.
3. **Fact-Checking Websites**: Consult fact-checking websites that may have investigated the claim.
4. **Social Media Verification**: Examine the origin and spread of the video to determine its authenticity.

Given the lack of specific information, we cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on typical verification processes, the claim could be classified as follows:

- If multiple reliable sources confirm the incident, it would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If some aspects are confirmed but others are disputed, it would be 'Half True'.

2. **Context**: The context of the rally, including the date, location, and nature of the event, is crucial.

1. **National Anthem and Flag Hoisting**: The claim that BJP leaders have disrespected the national anthem and flag hoisting is a serious allegation. Without specific evidence or context, such as a recorded incident or official statement, it is difficult to verify this part of the claim.

2. **Flag Hoisting at RSS Office in Nagpur**: The claim that the flag hoisting did not take place at the RSS office in Nagpur can be checked against reports from that specific event. If there are credible sources stating that the flag hoisting did not occur, the claim would have some basis. However, if there is evidence that the flag hoisting did occur, the claim would be false.

2. **Suicide Incident**: While it is true that there were reports of a student committing suicide, attributing the cause solely to the government's decision on the exams requires concrete evidence.
3. **Causality**: Establishing a direct causal link between the government's decision and the suicide requires specific evidence that the suicide was indeed due to the exams not being postponed. Without such evidence, the claim is speculative.

3. **Source Authenticity**: Ensure that the images are genuine and were taken at the claimed event.

The ground resonated with chants of 'Jay Shri Ram'.',"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Evidence of the Rally**: Was there indeed a rally in Bihar where Yogi Adityanath Ji spoke?
2. **Crowd Size**: Was the crowd massive?
3. **Chants**: Were there chants of ""Jay Shri Ram""?

Without specific evidence or verified sources, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume typical scenarios where political rallies are common and chants are often reported, we can make a reasonable assessment.

If there is credible evidence that a rally occurred, the crowd was large, and chants of ""Jay Shri Ram"" were indeed heard, the claim could be considered at least 'Mostly True'. If the crowd size or the chants are exaggerated or unverified, it might be 'Half True'.

करतारपुर गुरुद्वारे की छत पर छापा पाकिस्तानी झंडा,false,hi,'Pakistani flag hoisted on the roof of Kartarpur Gurdwara'.,"To evaluate the claim ""Pakistani flag hoisted on the roof of Kartarpur Gurdwara,"" it is essential to consider the context and historical accuracy of such an event. Generally, flags are not hoisted on the roofs of religious buildings, especially in sensitive religious sites like the Kartarpur Gurdwara, which is a highly revered Sikh shrine.

Given that the Kartarpur Gurdwara is a significant pilgrimage site, it is unlikely that a Pakistani flag would be hoisted on its roof, as it would be seen as disrespectful to the religious sentiments associated with the gurdwara. Moreover, there is no widely reported or documented evidence to support this claim.

Therefore, based on the available information and the general practices surrounding religious sites, the claim appears to be inaccurate.

Without such information, it is not possible to accurately classify the claim.

However, if this claim has been widely reported by reputable news sources or confirmed by official statements, it would be considered true or mostly true. If there is conflicting or limited information, it might be classified as half true or mostly false. If there is no credible evidence to support the claim, it would be considered false.

1. **Official Announcements**: Check if there has been an official announcement from the Prime Minister's Office or any government authority regarding alcohol prohibition.
2. **Media Reports**: Verify if other credible news sources have also reported this announcement.
3. **Context and Feasibility**: Consider the feasibility and context of such a sudden and sweeping policy change.

Without specific details or verification from multiple reliable sources, it is unlikely that such a significant policy change would be announced without extensive prior notice and discussion.

However, based on general knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic, it is plausible that a police officer could contract the coronavirus while on duty during a lockdown.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there is no widely known or documented case of a strange experiment being conducted on a death row inmate in Boston in 1986.

1. **Statue of Unity Cost**: The Statue of Unity, located in India, cost approximately $430 million (₹2,989 crore) to construct.

2. **China's Sea Bridge Cost**: The claim doesn't specify which sea bridge, but one notable example is the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. The cost of this bridge is estimated to be around $20 billion.

Comparing the two:
- The Statue of Unity cost is significantly lower than the cost of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.
- The claim suggests that for the cost of the Statue of Unity, China built a sea bridge, implying similar costs, which is not accurate based on the known costs of these projects.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate because the costs of the two projects are not comparable.

As of my current knowledge up to 2023, there is no credible information to support the claim that the Kerala government announced a blackout to prevent people from watching the Ram temple ground-breaking ceremony on August 5.

Without specific details or additional context, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on typical journalistic standards, here's how we might approach evaluating such a claim:

1. **Verification of the Video**: Is the video authentic? Has it been verified by multiple sources?
2. **Identification of the Individual**: Is there confirmation from reliable sources that the person being beaten is indeed a BJP MLA from Haryana?
3. **Official Statements**: Have any official statements been made by the BJP, the Haryana government, or local authorities regarding the incident?
4. **News Reports**: Are there credible news reports corroborating the claim?

Without these details, we can't conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have some hypothetical additional information:

- The video has been widely circulated, but its authenticity has not been independently verified.
- There are conflicting reports about the identity of the person being beaten.
- No official statements have been made by the BJP or local authorities.
- Some news outlets have reported the claim but with varying degrees of certainty.

1. Whether the video is indeed recent.
2. Whether the video actually depicts a farmer protest.
3. Whether the protest is against the agricultural bill.

Without access to the specific video in question, I cannot definitively verify these points. However, I can guide you on how to assess the claim:

1. **Check the Date**: Look for any timestamps or metadata that indicate when the video was recorded or uploaded.
2. **Verify the Content**: Ensure that the video shows a farmer protest and not another type of event.
3. **Context of the Protest**: Look for signs, banners, or chants that indicate the protest is specifically against the agricultural bill.
4. **Cross-Reference News Sources**: Compare the video with recent news reports to see if the event depicted matches any documented farmer protests against the agricultural bill.

If the video meets all these criteria, the claim is likely true. If some criteria are met but not all, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the video does not meet these criteria, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

However, based on the general structure of the claim, it is important to note that such allegations often involve complex legal and ethical issues that require careful investigation. The claim itself is framed in a way that suggests potential deceit and legal transgressions, but without concrete evidence or corroboration from reliable sources, it remains speculative.

However, the specific claim about how ""sisters are tortured"" requires more context and verification.

However, based on general knowledge and reports from various regions, it is known that inter-communal tensions and incidents of harassment do occur in some areas. These incidents are often complex and can be influenced by a variety of social, political, and religious factors. It is important to note that such incidents are not representative of all Muslim majority areas and that many communities live in harmony.

Amul, being a large and essential dairy cooperative, typically continues operations to ensure the supply of dairy products.

However, it's possible that specific centers might have temporarily closed or adjusted operations due to localized COVID-19 restrictions or safety measures.

I feel ashamed, have only Hindu brothers taken the responsibility of secularism?'","To evaluate the claim made by Rubika Liyaquat, we need to consider the historical and cultural contexts of interfaith practices in India.

1. **Iftar and Namaz in Temples**: It is true that there have been instances where temples have hosted Iftar meals and allowed Muslims to offer Namaz. These gestures are often seen as symbols of communal harmony and interfaith solidarity.

2. **Navratri Puja in Mosques**: There is no widely documented evidence of Navratri puja being organized in mosques. This could be due to various factors, including the traditional use of mosques primarily for Islamic rituals and the lack of widespread interfaith initiatives of this nature.

3. **Responsibility of Secularism**: The claim that only Hindu brothers have taken the responsibility of secularism is a subjective interpretation. Secularism in India is a constitutional principle that calls for the state to maintain neutrality in religious matters. Different communities have engaged in interfaith activities to varying degrees, and it is not accurate to place the responsibility solely on one community.

Given these points, the claim is partially true in that there are examples of temples hosting Iftar and Namaz, but it is not accurate to say that Muslims have never engaged in interfaith activities or to place the burden of secularism solely on Hindus.

"बारकोड से चीनी और भारतीय प्रोडक्ट में अंतर किया जा सकता है. जो बारकोड 690 से लेकर 699 तक की संख्या से शुरू हों, वे चीन में बने हैं.",mostly false,hi,'Barcodes can be used to differentiate between Chinese and Indian products. Those barcodes that start with numbers ranging from 690 to 699 are made in China.',"The claim that barcodes can be used to differentiate between Chinese and Indian products, and that those starting with numbers ranging from 690 to 699 are made in China, is mostly accurate but requires some clarification.

Barcodes starting with 690 to 699 do indeed indicate that the product is manufactured in China. However, it's important to note that not all Chinese products will have barcodes in this range, and other countries may use different ranges. For instance, barcodes starting with 890 are used for products made in India.

Therefore, while the claim is largely correct regarding the specific range for China, it does not fully address the broader context of barcode usage for other countries like India.

Without concrete evidence or context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

आदित्य ठाकरे सीएम बनने के लिए अजमेर शरीफ दरगाह पहुंचे हैं.,half true,hi,'Aditya Thackeray has arrived at Ajmer Sharif Dargah to become the Chief Minister.',"The claim that ""Aditya Thackeray has arrived at Ajmer Sharif Dargah to become the Chief Minister"" can be evaluated based on the following considerations:

1. **Contextual Knowledge**: Aditya Thackeray is a prominent political figure, but becoming the Chief Minister involves a political process and official announcements. Visiting a religious site like Ajmer Sharif Dargah does not directly correlate with assuming a political office.

2. **Lack of Official Confirmation**: Without official confirmation from reliable news sources or political announcements, the claim that visiting Ajmer Sharif Dargah is directly related to becoming the Chief Minister seems implausible.

3. **Logical Deduction**: Political appointments are made through elections, party decisions, or constitutional processes, not through religious visits.

Considering these factors, the claim is likely exaggerated or misleading.

**Final Answer:** Mostly False",,False,True
"युवा बेरोजगारी से तंग आकार आत्महत्या कर रहा है, लेकिन इसकी परवाह किये बिना पीएम मोदी उद्योगपतियों के साथ अपना जन्मदिन मना रहे हैं.",mostly false,hi,"""Youth, frustrated with unemployment, are committing suicide, but without caring about this, PM Modi is celebrating his birthday with industrialists.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components:

1. **""Youth, frustrated with unemployment, are committing suicide.""**
2. **""PM Modi is celebrating his birthday with industrialists.""**
3. **""Without caring about this (unemployment-related suicides).""**

### Component Analysis:

1. **Youth Unemployment and Suicides:**
   - There is evidence that unemployment can lead to mental health issues and, in some cases, suicide. However, linking all youth suicides directly to unemployment without specific data is a generalization.

2. **PM Modi Celebrating Birthday with Industrialists:**
   - There have been reports of Prime Minister Modi attending events with industrialists. However, the context and specific occasions need to be verified.

3. **Lack of Care for Unemployment-Related Issues:**
   - This is a subjective claim. PM Modi's government has launched various initiatives aimed at addressing unemployment, such as ""Skill India"" and ""Startup India."" Whether these are sufficient or not is debatable, but claiming a complete lack of care is speculative.

### Conclusion:

- The claim that youth are committing suicide due to unemployment is partially true, as unemployment can be a contributing factor.
- The claim that PM Modi celebrates his birthday with industrialists could be true based on reported events, but the specific context and frequency need verification.
- The claim that PM Modi does not care about unemployment-related issues is subjective and not fully substantiated.

### Final Answer:
**Final Answer: Half True**

The claim has elements of truth but also includes speculative and subjective components that are not fully supported by evidence.",half true,False,False

भारत-चीन सीमा पर हुई झड़प।,false,hi,There was a clash on the India-China border.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There was a clash on the India-China border,"" we need to verify it against known historical events. As of my last update in October 2023, there have been several reported clashes and tensions between India and China along their disputed border in recent years. Notable incidents include the Galwan Valley clash in June 2020, which resulted in casualties on both sides.

बाबरी मस्जिद की एक तस्वीर जहां पर मुस्लिम आखिरी बार नमाज़ अदा कर रहे हैं.,false,hi,'A photograph of the Babri Mosque where Muslims are performing prayers for the last time.',"To evaluate the claim ""'A photograph of the Babri Mosque where Muslims are performing prayers for the last time,'"" we need to consider historical context and available evidence. The Babri Mosque, located in Ayodhya, India, was demolished on December 6, 1992. Prior to its demolition, it was a site of significant religious tension and dispute. While it is possible that there are photographs of Muslims performing prayers at the mosque, verifying whether a specific photograph depicts the ""last time"" prayers were performed would require specific documentation or evidence.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, it is difficult to conclusively determine its accuracy without additional context or verification. Therefore, the claim can be considered partly speculative and not entirely verifiable without more information.

1. **Evidence**: Is there any official report, news article, or statement from a credible source verifying the recovery of weapons from a madrasa in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh?
2. **Specificity**: Does the claim specify the exact location, date, and circumstances of the recovery?
3. **Pictorial Evidence**: Is the picture provided authentic and does it clearly show the weapons in question?

Without access to specific evidence and verification from credible sources, it is not possible to definitively label the claim as true or false. However, if the claim is based on a widely reported and verified incident, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the claim lacks substantial evidence or is based on unverified or disputed information, it could be considered 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific details provided in the question, a conservative approach would be to label the claim as 'Half True' until further verification can be obtained.
