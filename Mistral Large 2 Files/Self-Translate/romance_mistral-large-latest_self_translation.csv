Le Nigeria dépense 7 fois moins en soins de santé par habitant que l'Afrique du Sud.,false,fr,Nigeria spends 7 times less on healthcare per capita than South Africa.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Nigeria spends 7 times less on healthcare per capita than South Africa,"" we need to compare the per capita healthcare expenditures of both countries.

According to the World Bank data for 2021:
- South Africa's current health expenditure per capita is approximately $764.
- Nigeria's current health expenditure per capita is approximately $108.

To verify the claim, we calculate the ratio of South Africa's expenditure to Nigeria's expenditure:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{764}{108} \approx 7.07 \]

This calculation shows that South Africa spends approximately 7.07 times more on healthcare per capita than Nigeria, which is very close to the claimed 7 times less.

Le quart bloquant a été supprimé de la Constitution sénégalaise. Il n'existe plus depuis 2006.,true,fr,The blocking quarter has been removed from the Senegalese Constitution. It no longer exists since 2006.,"The ""blocking quarter"" refers to a provision in the Senegalese Constitution that requires a supermajority of votes (often three-quarters) to pass certain types of legislation or constitutional amendments. According to the statement, this provision was removed from the Senegalese Constitution in 2006.

However, as of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely known or documented change in 2006 that removed the ""blocking quarter"" from the Senegalese Constitution. The Senegalese Constitution has undergone several revisions, but the specific removal of the ""blocking quarter"" in 2006 is not a well-established fact.

Therefore, based on the available information, the claim that the ""blocking quarter"" was removed from the Senegalese Constitution in 2006 is likely false.

Youth unemployment is even more dramatic, at 32%; this means that 3 out of 10 young people do not have a job.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Unemployment Rate Comparison to European Average**: The claim states that the unemployment rate was two points lower than the European average during their time in government and is now two points higher. This requires data on both the country's unemployment rate and the European average at the relevant times.

2. **Youth Unemployment Rate**: The claim states that youth unemployment is at 32%, meaning 3 out of 10 young people are unemployed. This requires current data on youth unemployment.

Without specific data, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim. However, we can analyze the structure and plausibility of the claim:

- If the unemployment rate data for the country and the European average at the specified times support the claim, then it would be true or mostly true.
- If the youth unemployment rate is indeed 32%, that part of the claim is accurate.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim cannot be fully verified. However, if we assume the speaker has accurate data to support the claim, it could be considered plausible.

The organization is known for its advocacy work and often uses research and data to support its claims. The statement specifies that nine out of the ten countries where it is ""the most difficult"" for girls to access education are in Africa. This suggests a significant focus on Africa, which aligns with known challenges related to education access for girls in many African countries due to factors like poverty, cultural norms, and inadequate infrastructure.

Without specific data from ONE's report, we rely on general knowledge and other reputable sources that often highlight the educational challenges faced by girls in Africa. Organizations like UNICEF and UNESCO frequently report on the difficulties girls face in accessing education in many African countries.

Given this context, the claim is likely accurate but may require specific data from ONE's report to be fully verified. However, based on general knowledge and reports from other credible sources, the claim is plausible.

For Education:
- The decrease is from 25% to 17%.

- This is a correct decrease of 8 percentage points.

For Health:
- The decrease is from 19% to 14%.
- The difference is \( 19\% - 14\% = 5\% \).
- This is a decrease of 5 percentage points, not 8 percentage points as claimed.

Since the claim about the decrease in the Health budget is not accurate, the overall claim is not entirely true.

1. Italy being the first country in terms of the number of blue helmets.
2. Italy being the eighth largest contributor in the world in terms of the budget for peacekeeping missions.

Let's analyze each part:

1. **Number of Blue Helmets**: As of my last update in October 2023, Italy is indeed one of the leading contributors to UN peacekeeping missions in terms of personnel. While specific rankings can change, Italy has historically been among the top contributors.

2. **Budget Contribution**: Italy is a significant financial contributor to UN peacekeeping missions. While the exact ranking can vary, it is plausible that Italy could be among the top contributors, potentially around the eighth position.

Given these considerations, the claim appears to be mostly accurate based on available information.

However, if we interpret the statement generally, it suggests that a portion of the electricity bill was denominated in U.S. dollars when the current government took office. Such a situation could occur in countries with economic instability or where the electricity sector relies heavily on imported fuel or technology paid for in dollars.

To provide an accurate assessment, we would need to know:
1. The country in question.
2. The specific time period referenced.
3. The context of the electricity billing system.

Given the lack of specific details, a balanced approach would be to consider this claim as 'Half True', as it could be plausible in certain contexts but lacks sufficient evidence to be fully verified or refuted.

1. Whether the country was exporting US$ 6 billion worth of fuels before 2011.
2. Whether the country started to import the same amount (US$ 6 billion worth of fuels) after 2011.

Without specific data or sources, it's challenging to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, significant shifts in a country's fuel export and import patterns can often be found in economic reports, energy statistics, or trade data from reliable sources such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the World Bank, or national statistical agencies.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, a general approach would be to consider this claim as needing further verification. If the claim is partially correct (e.g., the export amount was close but not exactly US$ 6 billion, or the import amount increased significantly but not to exactly US$ 6 billion), it might be considered 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the data is largely inaccurate, it might be considered 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

As of the latest available data, Argentina does have a significant poverty rate. According to various sources, including the World Bank and national statistics, Argentina's poverty rate has been relatively high compared to other countries in Latin America. However, it is important to note that the poverty rates can fluctuate and comparisons can vary depending on the specific time frame and methodologies used for measurement.

While Argentina's poverty rate is high, there are other countries in the region that have similarly high or even higher poverty rates. Therefore, the claim that Argentina is ""one of the countries with the highest poverty rate in Latin America"" is generally accurate, but it is not necessarily the country with the single highest poverty rate.

As of recent data, Italy has been one of the leading countries in Europe in terms of granting citizenships to foreign citizens. According to Eurostat, Italy has consistently been among the top countries in Europe for naturalizations. However, it's important to note that data can fluctuate and other countries like Germany, France, and Spain also grant a significant number of citizenships.

Given the available information, while Italy is indeed one of the top countries in Europe for granting citizenships, claiming it is ""the most"" could be an overstatement without specific and up-to-date data to confirm it. Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate but not entirely precise.

According to various sources, including the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of industrial workers has seen significant changes over the past few decades. In the United States, for example, the manufacturing sector (a significant part of the industrial sector) has seen a decline in employment since the 1990s. This trend is often attributed to factors such as automation, globalization, and shifts in the economy.

While there may be fluctuations and variations depending on the specific industry and region, the overall trend indicates a reduction in industrial employment compared to the 1990s. Therefore, the claim that the number of industrial workers is the same today as it was in the '90s is not accurate.

The phrase ""on the run"" could refer to various phenomena, such as emigration, economic migration, or escaping difficult socio-economic conditions. Without specific figures or reasons provided in the claim, it is challenging to give a precise evaluation.

However, it is a well-documented phenomenon that many young Italians have been leaving the country due to economic difficulties, high unemployment rates, and a lack of opportunities. According to Eurostat and other sources, Italy has experienced significant youth emigration in recent years.

1. **Historical Context**: In June 2017, there were indeed reports about a potential breakthrough in diabetes treatment involving a vaccine. These reports stemmed from research conducted at the University of Tampere in Finland, which suggested that a vaccine developed for tuberculosis (BCG vaccine) might also have benefits for type 1 diabetes patients.

2. **Media Coverage**: The news of this research was covered by various media outlets, and it is plausible that it resurfaced on French-language websites and was widely shared on social networks.

3. **Accuracy of the Claim**: While the claim accurately reflects that there was an announcement and subsequent media coverage, it is important to note that the research was preliminary and did not constitute a definitive vaccine against diabetes. The BCG vaccine was being studied for its potential to modulate the immune system in a way that could benefit type 1 diabetes patients, but it was not a cure or a fully developed vaccine specifically for diabetes.

Given these points, the claim is mostly accurate regarding the existence of the announcement and its spread on social media, but it may overstate the implications of the research.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the director for Africa of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFRI) has indeed made this statement.
2. **Data Verification**: Verify the actual malnutrition rates in Senegal over the relevant period to see if there has been a 50% reduction.
3. **Contextual Analysis**: Understand the context in which the reduction is claimed, such as the specific time frame and the metrics used to measure malnutrition.

Given that I don't have real-time access to the internet to verify the latest data or statements from IFRI, I'll provide a hypothetical evaluation based on general knowledge and typical methods of fact-checking:

- **Source Verification**: If the statement is attributed to a reputable source like IFRI, it carries some credibility, but we need to confirm the exact quote and context.
- **Data Verification**: We would typically check reports from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, or the World Bank to see if the data supports a 50% reduction in malnutrition rates.
- **Contextual Analysis**: The claim should specify the time frame and the type of malnutrition (e.g., stunting, wasting, underweight).

According to various international studies and reports, such as those by the OECD and the World Bank, Italy does have a relatively high corporate tax rate. However, it is not the highest in the world. Countries like France, Belgium, and some others have higher corporate tax rates. Additionally, the effective tax rate (which takes into account various deductions, credits, and other factors) can vary significantly and may not place Italy at the top globally.

Mining employment has seen significant fluctuations over the years, influenced by factors such as market demand, technological advancements, and regulatory changes. While it is plausible that mining jobs have increased, the claim of such a dramatic rise from 79,000 to almost half a million requires verification from authoritative sources such as government labor statistics or industry reports.

Without that information, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the statement. However, I can provide a general approach to how you might assess such a claim:

1. **Identify the country**: Determine which country the claim is referencing.
2. **Check official sources**: Look up the country's official consulate listings in the United States. This information is typically available on the country's foreign affairs ministry website or the U.S. State Department website.
3. **Count the consulates**: Verify the number of consulates listed.

Given the lack of specific context, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, if you provide the country in question, I can help you assess the claim more accurately.

[La minor spesa per il reddito di cittadinanza] non è deficit. Questo dimostra proprio che non è deficit come si diceva,false,it,'[The lower spending on citizens' income] is not a deficit. This precisely shows that it is not a deficit as was said.',"The statement claims that lower spending on citizens' income is not a deficit and that this demonstrates it is not a deficit. However, a deficit refers to a shortfall between revenue and spending, not the level of spending on a particular item. Lower spending on citizens' income could still be part of an overall budget where expenditures exceed revenues, which would be a deficit. Therefore, the statement is misleading as it conflates the concept of a deficit with spending levels on a specific area.

“[Tuvo] la inflación más alta de los últimos 25 años”,true,es,"""[It had] the highest inflation of the last 25 years.""","To evaluate the claim that an event had ""the highest inflation of the last 25 years,"" we need more context and data. Specifically, we need to know the period and the region or country being referred to, as well as the source of the inflation data. Without this information, it's impossible to accurately assess the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on reliable economic data for a specific period and region, and that the data shows a peak in inflation over the last 25 years, then the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the data shows that inflation was high but not the highest, it might be 'Half True'. If the data contradicts the claim significantly, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Final Answer: Without specific data, it's impossible to give a definitive answer. However, assuming reliable data backs the claim, it could be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.",,False,True
"Le Sénégal, premier prodcteur de sel, d'Afrique de l'*Ouest, importe pourtant le quart de sa consommation.",mostly true,fr,"'Senegal, the leading salt producer in West Africa, still imports a quarter of its consumption.'","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and data available. Senegal is indeed a significant salt producer in West Africa, but whether it imports a quarter of its consumption depends on multiple factors, including the balance between production and consumption, trade agreements, and market dynamics.

Without specific data on Senegal's salt production and import statistics, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, it is not uncommon for countries to import certain commodities even when they are significant producers, due to factors like seasonal demands, quality variations, or economic policies.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific data, the claim likely falls somewhere between being entirely true or false. Therefore, a cautious assessment would be:

Un Nigerian sur cinq souffre de dépression à long terme.,false,fr,One in five Nigerians suffers from long-term depression.,"To evaluate the claim that ""One in five Nigerians suffers from long-term depression,"" we need reliable data from credible sources such as mental health organizations, government reports, or peer-reviewed studies.

Unfortunately, without specific data to reference, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, general knowledge and available data on mental health in Nigeria suggest that while mental health issues are prevalent, the claim of ""one in five"" suffering from long-term depression might be an overestimate.

Based on available information:
- The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that depression affects about 3.2% of the population in Nigeria.
- Other studies suggest that while mental health issues are significant, they do not reach the level of one in five for long-term depression specifically.

Given this context, the claim appears to be an exaggeration.

In my opinion, we are in a fiscal Soviet Union because we are in a fiscal police state.""","To evaluate the claim accurately, we need to consider the context and the specific policies being referred to. The claim suggests that the Minister of Economy and Finance, Roberto Gualtieri, has announced that the government can seize accounts if payments are behind, and it likens this to a ""fiscal police state"" or ""fiscal Soviet Union.""

1. **Announcement by Roberto Gualtieri**: We need to verify if Roberto Gualtieri made such an announcement. If it is true that he announced policies allowing the government to seize accounts for overdue payments, this part of the claim would be accurate.

2. **Seizure of Accounts**: Many countries have laws allowing the government to seize assets or accounts for unpaid taxes or debts. This is a common practice and not unique to any particular political system.

3. **Fiscal Police State/Soviet Union**: The comparison to a ""fiscal police state"" or ""fiscal Soviet Union"" is a subjective interpretation and may not accurately reflect the nature of the policy. Such comparisons are often used to evoke strong emotional responses and can be hyperbolic.

Without specific details of the announcement and the actual policies, it's challenging to fully verify the claim. However, based on the general context of governmental powers to seize assets for unpaid debts, the claim that such powers exist is likely true. The comparison to a ""fiscal police state"" or ""fiscal Soviet Union"" is more subjective and less factually grounded.

"Le Nigéria, premier producteur de bébés infectés par le VIH",true,fr,"'Nigeria, the leading producer of babies infected with HIV'.","To evaluate the claim that ""Nigeria is the leading producer of babies infected with HIV,"" we need to examine current data and statistics on HIV infection rates among newborns globally.

According to UNAIDS, the leading countries with high rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV are typically in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria does have a significant number of cases, but countries like South Africa often report higher numbers of new pediatric HIV infections due to their larger overall population and higher prevalence of HIV.

Without specific and up-to-date data from a reputable source like UNAIDS or the World Health Organization, it's difficult to definitively say that Nigeria is the leading producer of babies infected with HIV. However, it is known that Nigeria has a substantial burden of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

Given the available information, the claim that Nigeria is the leading producer of babies infected with HIV is likely an overstatement. It is more accurate to say that Nigeria is one of the countries with a high number of such cases, but not necessarily the leading one.

"«Il regolamento di Dublino, penalizzante per l’Italia, non viene abolito ma rimane in vigore e il principio di accoglienza per il Paesi di primo ingresso rimane intatto con grave pregiudizio per l’Italia»",half true,it,"""The Dublin Regulation, which is penalizing for Italy, is not abolished but remains in force, and the principle of reception for the countries of first entry remains intact, to the serious detriment of Italy.""","The Dublin Regulation, officially known as the Dublin III Regulation, is a European Union law that determines which EU Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application. The regulation generally assigns responsibility to the first EU country where the asylum seeker entered or applied for asylum. Italy, being a major point of entry for migrants and refugees into the EU, has indeed been significantly impacted by this regulation.

The claim states that the Dublin Regulation remains in force and that the principle of reception for the countries of first entry remains intact, which is accurate. The regulation has not been abolished and continues to place a disproportionate burden on countries like Italy, which are often the first point of entry for many migrants.

Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate, although it could be seen as biased or exaggerated in its emphasis on the negative impacts on Italy.

Les femmes portent l’ADN masculin de tous ceux avec qui elles ont eu des rapports intimes,false,fr,'Women carry the male DNA of all those with whom they have had intimate relations'.,"The claim that ""Women carry the male DNA of all those with whom they have had intimate relations"" is largely a misinterpretation of scientific findings. While it is true that male DNA can be found in a woman's body after sexual intercourse, this DNA does not permanently integrate into the woman's own genetic material. The presence of male DNA is typically from sperm that can persist in the body for a short period but does not become a permanent part of the woman's genetic makeup.

1. **Allocation of subsidies to 100 daaras**: This suggests that the government provided financial support to 100 traditional Quranic schools (daaras).
2. **Establishment of 64 modern daaras**: This indicates that the government helped create 64 modernized Quranic schools.
3. **A legal framework**: This implies that the government put in place laws or regulations pertaining to daaras.

Without specific verification from official government documents or reports, it's challenging to definitively confirm or deny these claims. However, if these achievements were documented in a government white paper, it would generally be considered a credible source. Therefore, based on the information provided:

- If the white paper is a legitimate government document, the claims are likely accurate.
- If there is any doubt about the authenticity or comprehensiveness of the white paper, the claims would be less certain.

Given the context and assuming the white paper is an official and reliable document, the claim is likely mostly true, with some potential for minor discrepancies or omissions.

Without access to such data, it is impossible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to reliable data that indicates the salary distribution of mayors in the country. Based on this hypothetical data, if the majority (but not necessarily 90%) of mayors earn less than 300,000 CFA francs, the claim would be considered mostly true. If the data shows that exactly 90% earn less than that amount, it would be true. If the data shows that significantly fewer than 90% earn less than that amount, it would be mostly false or false. If the data is inconclusive or shows a roughly even split, it would be half true.

The claim states that there are 900,000 single mothers in the country, with half of them at risk of poverty.

1. **Number of Single Mothers**: The claim that there are 900,000 single mothers would need to be verified against official census data or reliable statistical sources. Without this verification, we cannot confirm the accuracy of this number.

2. **Poverty Risk**: The claim that half of these single mothers are at risk of poverty also needs verification from reliable sources. Poverty rates among single mothers can vary significantly based on various factors, including the country's economic situation, social policies, and support systems.

3. **Context and Interpretation**: The claim suggests that single mothers are more in difficulty than other mothers. While it is generally true that single mothers face unique challenges, the extent to which they are more in difficulty than other mothers would depend on specific circumstances and comparative data.

Given the lack of specific verification for the numbers provided (900,000 single mothers and half at risk of poverty), and without context-specific data to support the claim that single mothers are more in difficulty than other mothers, the claim cannot be fully validated or refuted.

Here's why:

1. The amount of alcohol on a key after sanitization is minimal and would evaporate quickly, especially in a well-ventilated area like a garage.
2. Car ignitions are designed to prevent sparks from occurring under normal circumstances.
3. There are no credible reports or evidence to support the claim that a car fire was started due to a key sanitized with alcohol.

Without this context, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.

However, based on the general nature of the claim, which suggests that there is information Salvini is not disclosing or discussing, we can infer the following:

1. If Salvini has made statements about swab testing in Lombardy and Veneto and there is evidence that significant information is being omitted, the claim could be 'Mostly True' or 'True'.
2. If the claim is based on speculation or lacks substantial evidence, it could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.
3. If the claim is entirely unfounded or false, it would be 'False'.

Road accidents are indeed a leading cause of death among young people, particularly in certain age groups such as adolescents and young adults. However, the rates of road accidents and related fatalities have been declining in many regions due to improvements in vehicle safety, stricter traffic laws, and increased awareness about road safety.

Therefore, the claim is mostly true but could benefit from additional specificity regarding the age groups and regions where this trend is most pronounced.

1. **Amount in Question**: One billion FCFA (West African CFA franc) is approximately 1.7 million USD. This is a substantial amount for annual royalties from a national anthem.

2. **Typical Royalties**: Royalties from national anthems are usually not significant because national anthems are often in the public domain or are used in contexts where royalties are not typically paid (e.g., government and public events).

3. **Léopold Sédar Senghor**: Senghor, the first President of Senegal, wrote the lyrics to the Senegalese national anthem, ""Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons."" While he is a notable figure, the claim that his heirs receive such a large sum annually from this work alone is highly unusual.

Given these points, it is unlikely that the heirs of Léopold Sédar Senghor receive more than one billion FCFA annually from the national anthem's author's rights. Therefore, the claim is likely exaggerated or false.

The claim states that the number of collective labor agreements was 200 in 2002 and has now increased to approximately 1500.

Without specific data, we can make an educated analysis based on general trends:

1. **Significant Increase**: The claim suggests a substantial increase from 200 to 1500, which is a 750% increase.
2. **General Trends**: If collective labor agreements have indeed increased significantly in many countries due to various factors such as labor laws, unionization efforts, and economic changes, the claim could be plausible.

However, without verifiable data to support the exact numbers, we cannot definitively say the claim is entirely true. It is possible that the numbers are exaggerated or not accurate. Therefore, the claim is likely partially true but not fully verifiable.

1. **""There are 800,000 more disability pensions than there should be.""**
   - This statement is quite vague and lacks specific context. It implies that there is an excess of 800,000 disability pensions beyond what is considered appropriate or justified, but it does not provide any basis for this determination. Without additional context or data, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this part of the claim.

2. **""They are more than the number of deaths in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Poland, Greece, and the Netherlands combined during World War II.""**
   - To evaluate this part of the claim, we need to compare the stated figure of 800,000 to the actual combined number of deaths in the mentioned countries during World War II.
   - According to historical data, the approximate number of deaths in these countries during World War II is as follows:
     - United States: Around 405,000 military deaths.
     - United Kingdom: Around 450,000 military and civilian deaths.
     - France: Around 560,000 military and civilian deaths.
     - Poland: Around 6 million military and civilian deaths.
     - Greece: Around 400,000 military and civilian deaths.
     - Netherlands: Around 200,000 military and civilian deaths.
   - Adding these figures together gives a total of approximately 8,015,000 deaths.

Comparing the claim of 800,000 excess disability pensions to the combined deaths of around 8,015,000, it is clear that the claim significantly understates the actual number of deaths. Therefore, the comparison is inaccurate and misleading.

- Verify if the support for a convicted individual aligns with the speaker's position on withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council.

Given the lack of specific details to cross-reference, the claim cannot be definitively verified as true or false. Therefore, the most accurate assessment based on the available information is:

In Italia i profughi veri arrivano in aereo,false,it,"""In Italy, real refugees arrive by plane.""","The claim that ""In Italy, real refugees arrive by plane"" is largely misleading. While some refugees may arrive by plane through resettlement programs or other legal pathways, a significant number of refugees arrive in Italy by sea due to its coastal location and proximity to regions experiencing conflict and instability, such as North Africa and the Middle East. Therefore, the statement does not accurately represent the primary means by which refugees enter Italy.

According to UNICEF, the percentage of women in Nigeria who were married before the age of 18 is approximately 43% as of the latest available data. This is slightly lower than the claimed 45%, but it is still a significant and concerning figure.

Given this information, the claim can be considered mostly accurate, although not perfectly precise.

"La Côte d'Ivoire, première économie de l'UEMOA et membre du top10 mondial de la croissance économique, a dit son Premier ministre.",true,fr,"""Ivory Coast, the leading economy of the UEMOA and a member of the world's top 10 in economic growth, said its Prime Minister.""","To evaluate the claim made by the Prime Minister of Ivory Coast, let's break it down into two parts:

1. **Ivory Coast is the leading economy of the UEMOA (West African Economic and Monetary Union).**
2. **Ivory Coast is a member of the world's top 10 in economic growth.**

### Part 1: Leading Economy of the UEMOA
The UEMOA consists of eight countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. Ivory Coast is often considered one of the leading economies in this union due to its significant GDP and economic influence.

### Part 2: Top 10 in Economic Growth
Economic growth rates can vary year by year, but Ivory Coast has indeed been recognized for strong economic growth in recent years. According to various reports from organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Ivory Coast has been among the fastest-growing economies in Africa and sometimes in the world.

### Conclusion
Given that Ivory Coast is generally acknowledged as a leading economy within the UEMOA and has exhibited strong economic growth rates that sometimes place it among the top performers globally, the claim is largely accurate but might not always hold true depending on the specific year and the exact ranking criteria.

However, if the claim implies that the European Parliament has addressed or discussed the issue of foreign fighters, it is likely to be at least partially true, as the European Parliament has indeed debated and issued resolutions related to foreign fighters, particularly in the context of counter-terrorism and security measures.

The Rdc (Reddito di Cittadinanza) – to date – has reached 1.4 million. And what about active policies? They are completely stalled. The regions have not even received the lists of beneficiaries.',"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Rei (Reddito di Inclusione) reaching 1.3 million people**: This is a specific figure that can be verified through official sources or reports.
2. **Rdc (Reddito di Cittadinanza) reaching 1.4 million people**: Similarly, this figure can be checked against official data.
3. **Active policies being completely stalled**: This is a more subjective claim and would require context and evidence to evaluate fully.
4. **Regions not receiving the lists of beneficiaries**: This is a specific claim that can be verified through official communications or reports.

Without access to real-time official data or reports, it's challenging to definitively confirm or refute these figures and claims. However, based on general knowledge and the nature of such claims, it's plausible that there could be some truth to the numbers but also potential for exaggeration or misinterpretation, especially regarding the status of active policies and the distribution of beneficiary lists.

“La Argentina es un país que consume el 70% de lo que produce”,mostly true,es,"""Argentina is a country that consumes 70% of what it produces.""","To evaluate the claim ""Argentina is a country that consumes 70% of what it produces,"" we need to consider the economic data on Argentina's production and consumption.

According to various economic indicators and reports, Argentina's economy is characterized by a significant level of domestic consumption relative to its production. However, the exact percentage can vary and is influenced by factors such as imports, exports, and the specific sectors being analyzed (e.g., agriculture, manufacturing, services).

While the claim specifies a precise figure of 70%, it is important to note that economic data can fluctuate, and the exact proportion of consumption to production may not be precisely 70%. However, it is generally recognized that Argentina has a high level of domestic consumption.

Given the general trend of high domestic consumption in Argentina, but without a precise confirmation of the 70% figure, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but not entirely precise.

Without specific details or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to relevant information. If the government did establish a partnership with the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Tutelary Council to combat the exploitation of children on the streets by their parents or other adults within the first year, the claim would be considered true or mostly true. If the partnership was established but not within the first year, it might be considered half true. If no such partnership was established or if the details are significantly different, it would be mostly false or false.

Since we don't have specific evidence to verify the claim, I'll provide a hypothetical answer based on common scenarios:

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
- The government announced a partnership with the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Tutelary Council to combat child exploitation within the first year.
- The partnership was officially launched and some initial steps were taken, but the full implementation is still in progress.

**Analysis:**
- The claim is mostly true because the partnership was established within the first year, but the full implementation is not yet complete.

However, based on the provided statement alone, it suggests that there were deliberate efforts by the previous state government administration to impede progress. Without additional evidence or context, it's challenging to definitively verify the truthfulness of the claim.

Given the lack of specific details, I would classify this claim as 'Half True' because it acknowledges difficulties and obstacles but doesn't provide enough evidence to confirm the intentionality or the extent of those actions.

“El año pasado hubo 3.262 personas asesinadas”,false,es,"""Last year there were 3,262 people murdered.""","To evaluate the claim ""Last year there were 3,262 people murdered,"" we need to verify this number against reliable sources, such as official crime statistics from the relevant country or region for the specified year. Without specific context (e.g., which country or year is being referred to), it is challenging to provide an accurate assessment.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we are referring to a specific country and year. We would typically look at data from sources like the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program in the United States, or similar national crime reporting agencies in other countries.

If, after checking reliable sources, we find that the number of murders reported is significantly different from 3,262, the claim would be considered inaccurate. If the number is close but not exact, it might be considered 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the number is entirely off, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Since we do not have the specific context or data to verify, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, for the purpose of this response, I will assume the claim is being evaluated based on hypothetical data.

The Bundestag's intention to better protect local politicians from hate crimes is stated, and the mention of a specific politician receiving death threats adds context to the issue.

If the figures provided (R$ 153 million received and 29.5% spent) are accurate according to official sources, the claim would be true. However, without verification from official sources, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of these figures.

Given the specificity of the claim and the lack of context for verification, a reasonable evaluation would be to consider it 'Mostly True' if the figures are generally aligned with official reports but might need further verification for complete accuracy.

2. The data from INAIL stating that ten people die from the virus contracted at the workplace each day.
3. The timing of the lockdown easing in Italy.

Without access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet, I cannot directly verify the specific numbers provided (300 infections and 10 deaths per day). However, I can provide a framework for how you might verify this information:

1. **Check INAIL Reports:** Look for official reports or press releases from INAIL that detail workplace-related COVID-19 infections and deaths.
2. **Government Announcements:** Review statements from the Italian government or health ministry regarding the easing of lockdown measures and the corresponding dates.
3. **News Reports:** Search for reliable news articles that cite INAIL data and provide context for the lockdown easing.

Given the absence of specific data verification tools here, the claim cannot be definitively labeled as true or false. However, based on the structure of the claim and the need for official data verification, a cautious approach would be to label it as 'Half True' until the specific numbers can be confirmed.

However, similar bills have been proposed or enacted in various jurisdictions around the world.

For example, in some states in the United States, laws mandating chemical castration for certain sex offenders have been enacted. Additionally, countries like Poland and South Korea have discussed or implemented similar measures.

Given that such bills do exist in various forms and contexts, but without specific information about the claimant's context, the claim can be considered plausible but not definitively verified.

Without this data, it is impossible to make an accurate determination.

However, for the sake of argument, let's assume we have access to relevant data:

1. If data shows a clear and consistent increase in the number of vaccinated children in Veneto, the claim would be 'True'.
2. If data shows a slight increase, the claim might be 'Mostly True'.
3. If data shows no significant change or mixed trends, the claim would be 'Half True'.

Consequently, the development of off-grid alternative solutions could create many more opportunities and transform millions of lives.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the current state of renewable energy in Africa and the potential impact of off-grid alternative solutions.

As of recent data, Africa indeed has a relatively low percentage of its electricity production capacity coming from renewable sources. According to various reports, the percentage of renewable energy in Africa's electricity mix is around 18-20%, which aligns with the claim.

Off-grid solutions, such as solar home systems, microgrids, and other decentralized renewable energy technologies, have the potential to significantly improve access to electricity in areas where grid extension is not feasible or cost-effective. These solutions can transform the lives of millions of people by providing reliable electricity for lighting, communication, and economic activities.

Given these points, the claim that renewable energies account for only 18% of Africa's current electricity production capacity and that the development of off-grid alternative solutions could create many more opportunities and transform millions of lives is mostly accurate.

2. **Official Statements**: Look for statements from local health authorities or the municipal government confirming the closure.
3. **Context and Timing**: Ensure that the closures occurred specifically during the pandemic period.

Without access to external databases to verify these points in real-time, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge, if there were widespread reports and confirmation from official sources, the claim could be considered at least 'Mostly True'.

The claim states that urban areas have an access rate of nearly 98.8% and rural areas have approximately 91%, resulting in an average of 95%.

While these numbers might seem high, they are not implausible. Many developed and developing countries have made significant progress in providing access to drinking water, especially in urban areas. Rural areas often lag behind due to infrastructure challenges, but a 91% access rate is still conceivable in many regions.

However, without specific data or context (such as the country or region being referred to), it is difficult to definitively confirm the accuracy of these percentages. The claim could be true for some countries but not for others.

2. **Analysis**: Compare the actual percentage of the budget allocated to public health with the claimed 30%.

3. **Conclusion**: Determine the accuracy of the claim based on the percentage difference.

Since I don't have real-time access to databases or the internet to verify the exact figures, I'll provide a hypothetical analysis based on how such a claim would typically be evaluated.

### Hypothetical Analysis

- **Scenario 1**: If the actual percentage is close to 30% (e.g., 28% to 32%), the claim would be 'True'.
- **Scenario 2**: If the actual percentage is somewhat close but deviates slightly (e.g., 25% to 35%), the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- **Scenario 3**: If the actual percentage is moderately different (e.g., 20% to 40%), the claim would be 'Half True'.
- **Scenario 4**: If the actual percentage is significantly different but not extremely so (e.g., 15% to 45%), the claim would be 'Mostly False'.
- **Scenario 5**: If the actual percentage is greatly different (e.g., below 15% or above 45%), the claim would be 'False'.

### Final Answer

Without specific data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the hypothetical scenarios:

**Final Answer:** 'Half True' (assuming the actual percentage is moderately different from 30%).

However, I can provide a general approach to how one might determine the truthfulness of such a statement:

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look at data from Italian government agencies, such as the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, or maritime authorities.
2. **Review News Reports**: Check for recent news articles from reputable outlets that discuss changes in port operations and entry points.
3. **Analyze Trends**: Examine historical data to see if there has been a significant increase in the number of ports and entries.

The claim states that many of the 98 billion from slot machines were canceled by the judiciary, not by the speaker's government. To determine the veracity of this claim, we would need to know:

1. Whether there was indeed a cancellation of a significant portion of the 98 billion related to slot machines.
2. Whether this cancellation was primarily due to the actions of the judiciary rather than the government.

Without additional context or specific evidence, it is challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the information provided, if we assume the claim is accurately representing the situation, it suggests that the judiciary played a significant role in the cancellation, which would make the claim at least partially true.

1. **Cost of the European Parliament in 2014**: The claim states that the European Parliament cost 1.737 billion in 2014. This is a specific figure that can be verified through official financial reports.

2. **Increase in cost over 5 years**: The claim asserts that the cost grew by over 300 million in 5 years. This would need to be compared with the budget figures for the subsequent years up to 2019.

3. **Dual seat in Strasbourg**: The claim suggests that maintaining two seats (Brussels and Strasbourg) costs taxpayers nearly 200 million per year. This is also a figure that can be checked against official reports and studies on the costs associated with the dual seat arrangement.

4. **Percentage of the Parliament's budget**: The claim states that the cost of the dual seat is equivalent to 10 percent of the entire Parliament's budget. This can be verified by comparing the cost of the dual seat with the total budget of the Parliament.

- The GDP of Côte d'Ivoire is approximately $67 billion.
- The GDP of Senegal is approximately $24 billion.

Combining the GDPs of Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, and Senegal gives us $43 billion + $67 billion + $24 billion = $134 billion.

However, if we assume a general context where power cuts are a known issue, the claim that there were ""no more power cuts"" would likely be rare and potentially exaggerated.

Without specific evidence or sources, it's difficult to definitively prove or disprove this claim. However, it's important to note that airport concessions and their extensions are typically complex processes involving various factors, including economic conditions, regulatory frameworks, and negotiations between stakeholders. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the aviation industry, suggesting a direct causal link to the extension of a specific concession without evidence is speculative.

Here are a few key points:

1. **Flat Tax (Flat Tax)**: Lega proposed a flat tax system, but it was not fully implemented due to budget constraints and disagreements within the coalition.
2. **Citizens' Income (Reddito di Cittadinanza)**: M5S introduced a citizens' income program, which was a form of welfare but not a direct tax reduction.
3. **Quota 100**: This was a pension reform that allowed earlier retirement, but it did not directly reduce taxes.
4. **Tax Amnesty (Pace Fiscale)**: They introduced a tax amnesty for those with outstanding tax debts, which reduced revenue but did not lower tax rates.

While there were attempts to reduce the tax burden, the initiatives were not comprehensive or fully realized. Therefore, the claim that M5S/Lega wanted to reduce the tax burden is true, but the claim that they successfully did so is not entirely accurate.

Matteo Salvini, an Italian politician, has advocated for chemical castration as a punishment for sex offenders. Chemical castration involves the use of drugs to reduce libido and sexual activity. While some countries have implemented this as a voluntary or mandatory measure for sex offenders, its effectiveness and ethical implications are debated.

- **Effectiveness**: Studies on the effectiveness of chemical castration are mixed. Some research suggests it can reduce recidivism rates among sex offenders, while other studies question its long-term effectiveness and potential side effects.
- **Ethical Considerations**: There are significant ethical concerns surrounding the use of chemical castration, including questions about informed consent, human rights, and the potential for misuse.

Given the debate surrounding both the effectiveness and ethical considerations of chemical castration, it is not accurate to unequivocally state that Salvini is ""right"" about it. The claim oversimplifies a complex issue with no clear consensus.

Without specific data or a recognized ranking system to refer to, it is challenging to definitively verify this claim. However, Senegal has made significant strides in malaria control and prevention, including the distribution of mosquito nets, improved diagnostics, and treatment strategies.

If the claim is suggesting that Matteo Renzi, the former Italian Prime Minister, has played a significant role in the economic growth or development of Africa, then we need to consider several factors:

1. **Renzi's Policies and Influence**: There is no widely recognized evidence that Matteo Renzi has had a substantial impact on Africa's economic growth or development. While he might have engaged in diplomatic efforts or trade agreements during his tenure, these are unlikely to be the primary drivers of Africa's growth.

2. **Africa's Growth**: Africa's growth is attributed to a multitude of factors, including internal economic reforms, increased foreign investment, and global economic trends, among others.

Given the lack of specific evidence linking Renzi directly to Africa's growth, the claim appears to be an overstatement.

According to various reports and studies, the educational attainment of Roma people varies widely but is generally lower than that of non-Roma populations in many countries. Factors such as discrimination, poverty, and lack of access to quality education contribute to lower school attendance and completion rates among Roma communities.

Without additional information, it's challenging to definitively assess the accuracy of the claim. However, let's break down the key points:

1. **Context of Default**: The claim mentions exiting default, which implies a country or entity has recently emerged from financial distress.
2. **Private Investment**: The claim refers to private investment, typically from businesses or investors.
3. **Amount**: The claim specifies over US$35 billion in announcements.
4. **Timeframe**: The claim focuses on a short period, just three months after exiting default.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific data in the claim, it's prudent to consider that such a significant influx of investment in a short period after exiting default is plausible but would require verification from reliable sources. Typically, such claims are supported by reports from financial institutions, government announcements, or major news outlets.

More leave [than arrive].""","To evaluate the claim that ""There are thousands of Emilians and Romagnols who go elsewhere to get treated [...]. More leave [than arrive],"" we need to consider the available data on healthcare mobility in the regions of Emilia-Romagna, Italy.

As of the latest available data, Emilia-Romagna has seen a pattern where a significant number of residents seek medical treatment outside their region. This phenomenon is often termed ""healthcare mobility."" According to reports, thousands of residents from Emilia-Romagna indeed travel to other regions for medical care, particularly for specialized treatments that may not be readily available or accessible locally.

However, the claim also suggests that more residents leave the region for treatment than those who come into the region for healthcare services. This part of the claim requires a comparative analysis of inbound and outbound healthcare mobility. While Emilia-Romagna does experience a notable outflow of patients, it is also a region that attracts patients from other parts of Italy due to its reputation for high-quality healthcare services.

Based on the available data, while it is true that thousands of Emilians and Romagnols seek treatment elsewhere, the assertion that more leave than arrive is not entirely accurate. The region experiences a substantial inflow of patients as well, making the net mobility less straightforward.

Given this analysis, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true. It contains elements of truth but requires nuance to fully capture the healthcare mobility dynamics in Emilia-Romagna.

"“El gasto social creció un 43,5%, eso significa que la inversión hacia los que menos tienen es lo que más creció en el presupuesto”",false,es,"""'Social spending increased by 43.5%, which means that investment towards those with the least is what grew the most in the budget.'""","To evaluate the claim accurately, we need to consider the context and specific details that are not provided in the statement. The claim mentions that social spending increased by 43.5% and that this represents the largest growth in the budget. However, without additional information on the overall budget growth and the proportion of other spending categories, it is difficult to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim.

Here's a breakdown of the evaluation process:

1. **Social Spending Increase**: The claim specifies a 43.5% increase in social spending. This is a precise number and can be verified if the specific data is available.

2. **Comparison to Other Budget Items**: The claim states that this increase represents the largest growth in the budget. To verify this, we would need to know the growth rates of other budget items.

Without the context of the overall budget and the growth rates of other spending categories, we cannot fully validate the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim can be considered 'Half True' because while the increase in social spending is stated, the comparison to other budget items is not fully substantiated.

“Somos una provincia récord en materia de reducción de mortalidad infantil”,true,es,"""We are a province with a record in reducing infant mortality.""","To evaluate the claim ""We are a province with a record in reducing infant mortality,"" additional context is needed, such as specific data on infant mortality rates over time and comparisons with other provinces or regions. Without this context, it's challenging to provide an accurate assessment. However, I can offer a general approach to evaluating such a claim.

1. **True**: If the province has consistently shown a significant reduction in infant mortality rates over a substantial period and this reduction is better than or comparable to other provinces.

2. **Mostly True**: If the province has made notable progress in reducing infant mortality, but there are some inconsistencies or the progress is not as substantial as claimed.

3. **Half True**: If the province has made some progress, but the claim overstates the achievements or the progress is not sustained over time.

4. **Mostly False**: If the province has made little progress, and the claim is largely inaccurate based on available data.

5. **False**: If the province has not made any significant progress in reducing infant mortality, or the data contradicts the claim.

Without specific data, a conservative approach would be to assume that some progress has likely been made but the extent and consistency of this progress are unclear.

Enquanto vários grupos privados de saúde anunciam a intenção de rompe......,false,pt,'While several private health groups announce their intention to break......',"To evaluate the claim ""While several private health groups announce their intention to break......"", more context or specific details about the claim are needed. Without additional information, it's challenging to determine its accuracy. However, based on the general structure of the claim, here are some considerations:

1. **Verifiability**: Can the announcements from several private health groups be verified through official statements, press releases, or news reports?
2. **Consistency**: Is the context of the claim consistent with known events or trends in the private health sector?
3. **Sources**: Are there credible sources that support the claim?

Without these details, a precise evaluation is not possible. However, for the sake of argument, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable announcements from multiple private health groups, it would likely fall into one of the following categories:

- **True**: If the claim is fully supported by credible sources and there is no dispute about the facts.
- **Mostly True**: If the claim is largely accurate but may have minor inaccuracies or missing context.
- **Half True**: If the claim has a mix of accurate and inaccurate information, making it only partially true.
- **Mostly False**: If the claim contains significant inaccuracies but may have some elements of truth.
- **False**: If the claim is entirely inaccurate or misleading.

Given the limited information provided, a conservative approach would be to label it as 'Half True' until further verification is possible.

Maioria dos [partidos] que estão no palanque do Alckmin estavam no palanque da Dilma,half true,pt,'The majority of the parties that are on Alckmin's platform were on Dilma's platform'.,"To evaluate the claim ""The majority of the parties that are on Alckmin's platform were on Dilma's platform,"" we need to compare the political coalitions of Geraldo Alckmin and Dilma Rousseff during their respective presidential campaigns.

Without specific data on the exact parties that supported Alckmin and Dilma, we can't provide a definitive answer. However, we can discuss the general context of Brazilian politics and coalitions.

In Brazilian politics, coalitions often shift between elections, but there can be some overlap in parties supporting different candidates. If Alckmin and Dilma were from different political spectra, it's less likely that the majority of their supporting parties would overlap. However, if they were from similar political backgrounds, there might be more common ground.

Given the lack of specific data, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as potentially having some truth but also requiring verification. Therefore, a reasonable evaluation without specific data would be:

As of recent data:

1. **Corporate Taxes**: The corporate tax rate in Hungary is indeed 9%, which is one of the lowest in the European Union.
2. **Personal Income Taxes**: The personal income tax rate is 15%, which is correct.
3. **Economic Growth**: Hungary's economic growth rate has varied, but it has been around 4% to 5% in recent years, so stating it as 5% is reasonable but might not be precise for every year.

Given these points, the claim is mostly accurate but could be more precise regarding the economic growth rate.

Le journal Sunday Standard rapporte que des femmes kenyanes font soigner leurs enfants atteints de rougeole avec de la fumée de marijuana.,mostly true,fr,The Sunday Standard newspaper reports that Kenyan women are treating their children's measles with marijuana smoke.,"To evaluate the claim that Kenyan women are treating their children's measles with marijuana smoke, we need to consider the plausibility and evidence supporting such a practice.

1. **Plausibility**: Treating measles with marijuana smoke is not a recognized or medically approved method. Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that typically requires supportive care and, in severe cases, medical intervention such as hospitalization.

2. **Medical Evidence**: There is no scientific evidence to support the use of marijuana smoke as an effective treatment for measles. In fact, exposing children to smoke of any kind is generally considered harmful due to the risk of respiratory issues.

3. **Credible Sources**: Reputable medical sources and health organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), do not recommend or recognize marijuana smoke as a treatment for measles.

Given the lack of medical evidence and the potential harm associated with exposing children to smoke, the claim that Kenyan women are treating their children's measles with marijuana smoke is highly unlikely to be true.

Les Nigérians sont les immigrés les plus instruits aux Etats-Unis.,false,fr,Nigerians are the most educated immigrants in the United States.,"The claim that ""Nigerians are the most educated immigrants in the United States"" is based on various studies and data sources that have reported high levels of educational attainment among Nigerian immigrants. For instance, data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other studies have shown that Nigerian immigrants tend to have higher levels of education compared to other immigrant groups and the general U.S. population.

However, it's important to note that such claims can vary depending on the specific data source and the time period considered. Additionally, educational attainment can be measured in different ways, such as the percentage of individuals with bachelor's degrees, advanced degrees, or overall years of education.

Given the available data and studies, the claim is generally supported but may not be universally true in every context or time period. Therefore, it is reasonable to classify this claim as:

**Final Answer: Mostly True**",mostly true,False,False
“No está perdiendo contra la inflación”,false,es,"""It is not losing against inflation.""","To evaluate the claim ""It is not losing against inflation,"" we need to consider the context in which it is made. Generally, if the claim is referring to an investment or asset, it implies that the investment or asset is at least maintaining its purchasing power over time.

If the claim is about a specific investment or asset, and it is not losing value relative to inflation, then the claim would be true. However, without specific context, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment.

In a general sense, without additional context, the claim could be considered 'Half True' because it depends on the specific circumstances of the investment or asset being discussed.

"Nesta época do ano, o clima seco e com ventos favorecem queimadas espontâneas e criminosas",mostly true,pt,"At this time of the year, the dry climate and winds favor spontaneous and criminal wildfires.","To evaluate the claim ""At this time of the year, the dry climate and winds favor spontaneous and criminal wildfires,"" we need to consider the context and specific time of the year the claim refers to. Generally, in many regions, dry climates and strong winds do indeed increase the risk of wildfires, both from natural causes (such as lightning strikes) and from human activities (including arson).

During certain seasons, such as summer or early fall in many temperate regions, the combination of dry conditions and windy weather creates ideal conditions for wildfires. However, without specific details about the region or the exact time of the year, it's challenging to provide a precise assessment.

Given the general truth that dry climates and winds do favor wildfires, but acknowledging that the claim lacks specificity that might make it universally true, a balanced assessment would be:

Without additional context or evidence, it's impossible to determine the veracity of the claim. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume we have access to the relevant legal documents and court rulings.

If the Supreme Federal Court did acquit the speaker of the charge of using public money to hire an office employee for private services, then the claim would be 'True'. If the acquittal was for a different or broader range of charges but not specifically for this one, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the acquittal did not occur or was for unrelated charges, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

**Final Answer:** Without specific evidence, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the hypothetical scenario where the acquittal is confirmed for the specific charge, the answer would be 'True'. If the acquittal is not confirmed or is for different charges, the answer would lean towards 'Mostly False' or 'False'.",,False,True

For example, the Council of Europe's Annual Penal Statistics (SPACE) reports have consistently shown that Italian prisons operate well above their official capacity.

While Italy may not necessarily have the most overcrowded prisons globally, the claim that Italian prisons are among the most overcrowded, particularly within the European context, is largely accurate.

1. **Drug Consumption:**
   - Drug consumption trends vary by country and region. In some countries, there has been an increase in drug use, particularly in illicit drugs such as opioids, methamphetamines, and cannabis.
   - However, in other countries, drug use rates may have stabilized or even decreased in certain categories.

2. **Sale of Weapons:**
   - The sale of weapons, including firearms, also varies significantly by country. Some countries have seen an increase in weapon sales, often driven by factors such as societal insecurity, changes in legislation, or cultural trends.
   - In other countries, strict regulations and societal attitudes may have led to a decrease or stabilization in weapon sales.

Given the variability and the lack of specific data provided in the claim, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about the trends in drug consumption and weapon sales without additional context or data.

However, it is a commonly acknowledged issue that some subsidies in many economies do end up benefiting those who do not need them. Without precise data, it is difficult to determine the exact percentage, but the claim that a significant portion of subsidies goes to those who do not need them is plausible.

Parole a confronto: la nuova Costituzione italiana e quella tedesca,mostly true,it,'Words in Comparison: The New Italian Constitution and the German One'.,"To evaluate the claim ""Words in Comparison: The New Italian Constitution and the German One,"" we need to consider whether there has been a meaningful comparison of the constitutions in terms of their words, structure, principles, or provisions.

The claim suggests that there is a direct comparison between the new Italian Constitution and the German one. However, without specific details or context provided in the claim, it is challenging to determine the accuracy of the comparison. Generally, constitutions can be compared based on their content, structure, historical context, and legal principles.

Given the lack of specific information, it is difficult to assert that the claim is entirely true or false. It is plausible that some comparisons can be made between the constitutions, but without knowing the extent and nature of these comparisons, we cannot definitively say that the claim is entirely accurate.

Therefore, the claim is ""Half True"" because while comparisons can be made, the accuracy and depth of such comparisons are not specified.

Without access to such documents, it is impossible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on typical practices, universities often publish their financial information in annual reports, which would be the best source to verify this claim.

If we assume that the claim is based on a reputable source or official report, it could be considered 'Mostly True' if the figure is approximately correct and can be verified through official university documents. If there is significant discrepancy or lack of verification, it might be considered 'Half True' or 'Mostly False.'

"Dalla Tav all'Ilva, le “retromarce” del M5s sono colpa di accordi «all'oscuro degli italiani»?",false,it,"""From TAV to Ilva, the 'backtracking' of the Five Star Movement is due to agreements 'kept hidden from Italians'?""","To evaluate the claim that the Five Star Movement's ""backtracking"" on issues like TAV and Ilva is due to agreements ""kept hidden from Italians,"" we need to consider the context and evidence available.

The Five Star Movement (M5S) has indeed shifted its positions on several high-profile issues, including the Turin-Lyon high-speed rail link (TAV) and the Ilva steel plant. Initially, M5S was strongly opposed to these projects, but later modified its stance after entering into coalition governments.

1. **TAV**: The M5S initially opposed the high-speed rail project, but after entering a coalition with the Democratic Party (PD), they softened their stance and eventually supported the project.
2. **Ilva**: Similarly, the M5S initially advocated for the closure of the Ilva steel plant due to environmental concerns but later agreed to keep it open with certain conditions after entering government.

The claim suggests that these shifts were due to ""agreements kept hidden from Italians."" While it is true that political parties often make compromises when forming coalitions, and some of these compromises may not be fully transparent to the public, it is not accurate to say that these agreements were entirely ""kept hidden."" Political negotiations and compromises are a part of the democratic process, and while details may not be fully disclosed, the broad outlines of policy shifts are typically communicated.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific evidence supporting the claim that these agreements were deliberately hidden, the most accurate assessment would be:

"Roraima, que exportava arroz, agora [após a demarcação de Raposa Serra do Sol] importa [arroz]",half true,pt,"""Roraima, which used to export rice, now [after the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol] imports [rice].""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the agricultural and economic shifts in Roraima, particularly in relation to the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol.

Roraima, a state in northern Brazil, was historically known for its rice production and export. However, the demarcation of the Raposa Serra do Sol indigenous territory, which was a significant political and territorial change, impacted the region's agricultural activities. The demarcation led to the displacement of some farmers and the reallocation of land to indigenous communities, which reduced the area available for commercial rice farming.

As a result of these changes, Roraima's rice production declined, leading to a shift from being a rice exporter to a rice importer. This shift is well-documented and is often attributed to the changes brought about by the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol.

Given this context, the claim that ""Roraima, which used to export rice, now [after the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol] imports [rice]"" is largely accurate. It reflects the economic and agricultural changes that occurred in the region due to the demarcation.

Since I don't have real-time data or specific details of Paola Taverna's statements, I'll provide a hypothetical analysis based on typical scenarios.

1. **Context and Claims**: If Paola Taverna has made specific claims about cuts to planned increases in healthcare funding, we need to verify these claims against official government budgets, healthcare funding reports, and statements from relevant authorities.

2. **Evidence**: Look for reports from reliable sources such as government budget documents, statements from healthcare officials, and analyses from reputable financial or healthcare institutions.

3. **Accuracy**:
   - **True**: If the claims align perfectly with the facts and figures from reliable sources.
   - **Mostly True**: If the claims are largely accurate but may have minor discrepancies or oversimplifications.
   - **Half True**: If the claims have significant elements of truth but also significant errors or omissions.
   - **Mostly False**: If the claims are mostly inaccurate but contain some elements of truth.
   - **False**: If the claims are entirely inaccurate or misleading.

Without specific details, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the phrasing '(almost) right,' it suggests that there is some accuracy but also some inaccuracy or oversimplification in the claims.

Une fille sur quatre au Sénégal a subi une mitulation génitale féminine.,half true,fr,One in four girls in Senegal has undergone female genital mutilation.,"The claim that ""One in four girls in Senegal has undergone female genital mutilation"" needs to be evaluated based on current data and reliable sources. According to the most recent data from sources like UNICEF and other international organizations, the prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM) in Senegal is significantly lower than one in four.

UNICEF's data indicates that the prevalence of FGM in Senegal is around 25% among women aged 15-49. This means that approximately one in four women in that age group has undergone FGM. However, it's important to note that the prevalence among girls under 15 is likely lower due to ongoing efforts to reduce the practice.

Given the available data, the claim that ""One in four girls in Senegal has undergone female genital mutilation"" is generally accurate for the age group of 15-49 but might not be as precise for younger girls. Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly true but not entirely accurate for all age groups.

Bellanova ha ragione: agli agricoltori rimangono le briciole,mostly true,it,"""Bellanova is right: farmers are left with the crumbs.""","To evaluate the claim ""Bellanova is right: farmers are left with the crumbs,"" we need context and evidence to determine its accuracy. Without specific data or references, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I'll make an educated guess based on general knowledge about agricultural economics.

Farmers often face financial challenges due to various factors such as market fluctuations, high input costs, and unequal distribution of profits along the supply chain. These issues can leave farmers with a smaller share of the final value of their products.

Given this general understanding, the claim that farmers are left with the crumbs is likely to have some truth but may not be entirely accurate in all cases. Therefore, a reasonable evaluation would be:

1. The claim states that electricity demand expanded by 41% between 2003 and 2011.
2. It also states that this expansion was almost 50% more than in the ""neoliberal phase.""

Without specific data on electricity demand growth during the ""neoliberal phase,"" we cannot definitively evaluate the second part of the claim. However, we can assess the first part based on the provided percentage.

If the claim about the 41% expansion in electricity demand between 2003 and 2011 is accurate, it would be considered true. However, the comparison to the ""neoliberal phase"" requires additional context and data to be fully verified.

Given the information provided, the claim about the 41% expansion is plausible, but the comparison to the neoliberal phase lacks sufficient data for a definitive evaluation. Therefore, the claim is partially true but not fully verifiable without additional context.

1. **Promise Not to Leave**: This would require verifying public statements or promises made by João Doria.
2. **Rejection Rate**: Polling data would be necessary to confirm the 60% rejection rate.
3. **Causal Link**: Determining whether fulfilling the promise would have prevented the rejection rate involves speculation and is difficult to prove empirically.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data, the claim likely falls somewhere between 'Half True' and 'Mostly False'. Without concrete evidence, it's not possible to fully substantiate the claim.

1. **Italy is the fourth country in the G7 in terms of the percentage of official development assistance (ODA) to gross national income (GNI).**
2. **Italy has reached 0.30% this year, ahead of schedule.**

To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need data on the ODA/GNI ratio for G7 countries and the specific target and schedule for Italy's ODA.

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to the most current data. However, based on historical trends and general knowledge up to that point:

- The G7 countries typically include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
- The target for ODA is often set by international agreements, such as the United Nations' target of 0.7% of GNI.

Without specific data for the current year, we can't definitively confirm Italy's exact ranking or percentage. However, if Italy has indeed reached 0.30% ahead of schedule and is fourth among the G7 countries, the claim would be mostly accurate, assuming the data source is reliable.

Giulia Grillo sbaglia: i medici e gli infermieri italiani non sono i meno pagati,false,it,Giulia Grillo is wrong: Italian doctors and nurses are not the lowest paid.,"To evaluate the claim that ""Giulia Grillo is wrong: Italian doctors and nurses are not the lowest paid,"" we need to consider the relative compensation of Italian healthcare professionals compared to those in other countries.

As of recent data, Italian doctors and nurses are indeed not the lowest paid in Europe or globally. While their salaries may not be among the highest, they are generally comparable to or higher than those in some other European countries. For example, Italian doctors tend to earn more than their counterparts in countries like Spain and Portugal, and nurses in Italy earn more than nurses in some Eastern European countries.

Given this context, the claim that Giulia Grillo is wrong about Italian doctors and nurses being the lowest paid is mostly accurate. However, it is important to note that the exact ranking can vary depending on the specific data sources and the countries included in the comparison.

Aflatoxins are a significant issue in Africa, impacting crops like maize and groundnuts, leading to economic losses, health issues, and trade barriers.

According to PACA's estimates, Africa does indeed face substantial economic losses due to aflatoxins. The figure of 370 billion CFA francs (approximately $670 million USD) is within the range of reported estimates of the economic impact of aflatoxins in Africa.

Without access to specific data and sources, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can outline the steps needed to verify this claim:

1. **Identify the Time Frame**: Determine the period during which Mauricio Macri was in government.
2. **Access Reliable Data**: Look for data from official government reports, economic studies, or reputable news sources that track the number of SME closures during Macri's tenure.
3. **Analyze Causality**: Assess whether there is a direct link between Macri's policies and the closure of SMEs, or if other factors (e.g., economic downturn, global trends) played a significant role.
4. **Consult Multiple Sources**: Use a variety of sources to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, a cautious approach would be to label the claim as 'Half True' unless there is clear, indisputable evidence supporting or refuting the statement.

There is no established medical or scientific link between Maroni beans and the severity of scabies. Scabies is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and is typically treated with topical creams or oral medications.

In 2015, Daniel Scioli was a candidate for the presidency of Argentina. Official advertising during an election campaign typically refers to government-funded advertisements. The claim suggests that a significant amount of money was spent on such advertisements during Scioli's campaign.

However, the figure of $1.5 billion seems extraordinarily high for official advertising, even for a presidential campaign. Without specific data or sources to verify this claim, it is challenging to confirm its accuracy.

Given the lack of supporting evidence and the unusually high amount cited, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is likely exaggerated or false.

“Todavía en la Argentina el 55% de los que trabajan se llevan al bolsillo $3200”,mostly true,es,"""In Argentina, still 55% of those who work take home $3200.""","To evaluate the claim that ""In Argentina, still 55% of those who work take home $3200,"" we need to consider the context and available data.

Firstly, the claim mentions a specific percentage (55%) and a specific amount ($3200). To verify this, we would typically look at official statistics from reputable sources such as government reports, economic studies, or international organizations like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Without specific data to cross-reference, we can make some general observations:

1. **Income Distribution**: Argentina has a significant income disparity, and a large portion of the workforce earns relatively low wages.
2. **Exchange Rate Fluctuations**: Argentina's currency, the Argentine Peso, has experienced significant fluctuations and devaluation, which affects the conversion to USD.
3. **Minimum Wage**: The minimum wage in Argentina is considerably lower than $3200 USD.

Given these points, it is unlikely that 55% of the workforce earns exactly $3200. The claim seems to oversimplify the income distribution and does not account for the wide range of salaries in Argentina.

However, according to general trends and data from reputable sources like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Senegal has indeed had a higher public debt-to-GDP ratio compared to Burkina Faso and Côte d'Ivoire.

- **Senegal**: Has been reported to have a public debt-to-GDP ratio around 65%.
- **Burkina Faso**: Typically has a lower debt-to-GDP ratio, often around 32%.
- **Côte d'Ivoire**: Also tends to have a lower debt-to-GDP ratio, often around 32%.

Without specific evidence or context provided in the claim, it is difficult to definitively confirm or refute the statement. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. **True**: If there is concrete evidence that both district voting and mixed district voting were comprehensively addressed and resolved during Eduardo Cunha's tenure.
2. **Mostly True**: If there is significant evidence that these matters were largely addressed, but perhaps not fully resolved or there were minor issues left unaddressed.
3. **Half True**: If there is some evidence that these matters were discussed or partially addressed, but significant aspects were left unresolved or not addressed at all.
4. **Mostly False**: If there is little evidence that these matters were substantially addressed, and they remain largely unresolved.
5. **False**: If there is no evidence that these matters were addressed at all during Eduardo Cunha's presidency.

Given the lack of specific evidence in the claim, a conservative evaluation would lean towards a middle ground, acknowledging that some actions might have been taken but not necessarily conclusive or comprehensive.

Without specific numerical data, we can't definitively confirm or refute the percentages mentioned. However, based on typical patterns in agricultural production, significant increases can occur due to various factors such as improved farming techniques, favorable weather conditions, and technological advancements.

Given the lack of concrete data, we can consider the following:

1. A 5% increase in one year is plausible and not uncommon.
2. A 71% increase over five years is also plausible, especially if there have been significant improvements in agricultural practices or favorable conditions over that period.

Without specific data, we can only speculate on the likelihood of these percentages. Therefore, the claim could be considered plausible but not definitively proven.

ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) has been known to have significant financial resources, but claiming that someone or something has ""all the money of ISIS"" is likely an exaggeration. ISIS's finances are derived from various sources such as oil smuggling, taxes, extortion, and external donations, and it is highly improbable that any single entity could control or possess all of their money.

Given the complexity and dispersed nature of ISIS's financial operations, the claim that someone or something has ""all the money of ISIS"" is likely false.

La sanità italiana è davvero «un’eccellenza mondiale»?,mostly true,it,"'Is Italian healthcare really ""a global excellence""?'","The claim that Italian healthcare is ""a global excellence"" is subjective and depends on various metrics and perspectives. Here are some points to consider:

1. **World Health Organization Ranking**: In a World Health Organization (WHO) report from 2000, Italy's healthcare system was ranked second in the world. However, this ranking is quite old, and more recent comparative studies are needed.

2. **Healthcare Quality and Access**: Italy provides universal healthcare to its citizens, which is a significant achievement. The country has a high life expectancy and low infant mortality rates, which are indicators of a strong healthcare system.

3. **Infrastructure and Innovation**: Italy has advanced medical facilities and is known for certain specialties like cardiology and oncology. However, there are also reports of underfunding and regional disparities in the quality of care.

4. **Comparative Studies**: In more recent comparisons, such as the Euro Health Consumer Index, Italy often ranks well but not consistently at the very top. It faces challenges similar to other developed nations, such as aging populations and budget constraints.

Given these points, while Italian healthcare has many strengths, it also faces significant challenges. Therefore, the claim that it is ""a global excellence"" is somewhat exaggerated.

Without specific details or a timeframe, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge and the need for such significant actions to be publicly announced and documented, we can assess the claim as follows:

1. **True**: This would imply that there is clear and documented evidence that Minister Gualtieri signed to activate the ESM, and this information is widely reported and verified.

2. **Mostly True**: This would mean that while Minister Gualtieri did indeed take steps towards activating the ESM, there might be some nuances or additional details that are not fully captured in the claim.

3. **Half True**: This would suggest that while there is some truth to the claim, there are also significant omissions or inaccuracies. For example, Minister Gualtieri might have discussed activating the ESM but did not actually sign anything.

4. **Mostly False**: This would imply that there is some element of truth to the claim, but it is largely misleading. For instance, Minister Gualtieri might have signed a document related to the ESM, but it was not specifically to activate it.

5. **False**: This would mean that there is no evidence to support the claim that Minister Gualtieri signed to activate the ESM.

Given the lack of specific details or context provided in the claim, and without external verification, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

2. **Minimum Living Wage**: This is typically calculated by organizations that study the cost of living in a particular area. It includes expenses like housing, food, transportation, healthcare, and other basic necessities.
3. **Collective Bargaining Timeline**: The claim mentions ""10 years of collective bargaining,"" which implies a specific timeframe that should be considered.

Without specific data on the minimum teacher salary and the minimum living wage for the region and time period in question, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if the claim is backed by credible sources and aligns with the data from reputable studies or reports, it could be considered true or mostly true.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data, a general approach would be:

- **True**: If the minimum teacher salary is definitively below the minimum living wage after verifying both figures from reliable sources.
- **Mostly True**: If the figures are close but not definitively below, or if the claim is largely accurate but may have some minor inaccuracies.
- **Half True**: If the claim is partially accurate but also has significant inaccuracies or lacks context.

Without specific context or data, it's challenging to provide a precise assessment. However, if the statement is made about a country known for severe restrictions in these areas (e.g., North Korea, Eritrea), it could be considered mostly true. For countries with more moderate restrictions, the claim might be half true or mostly false.

Without access to specific data or reports, it's challenging to give a definitive answer. However, I can provide a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. **Existence of the Program**: Verify if the ""New Work"" program was indeed implemented during the person's tenure as secretary.
2. **Job Creation**: Check if the program generated more than 2,000 jobs.
3. **Target Population**: Confirm if these jobs were specifically for the homeless population.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, Côte d'Ivoire is one of the world's largest producers of cashew nuts, which could potentially lead to lower prices due to higher supply and lower transportation costs.

Given the lack of precise data, a reasonable assessment would be that the claim might have some truth but requires specific evidence to be fully accurate. Therefore, the claim is likely ""Half True.""

Without additional information, such as the date, the context of the statement, or the source of the video, it is impossible to verify the truthfulness of the claim.

However, for the sake of this exercise, if the claim is presented in a reputable source with verifiable evidence (such as a direct quote from a press conference or an official statement), it would likely be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True.' Conversely, if the claim lacks credible sourcing or is taken out of context, it might be 'Half True,' 'Mostly False,' or 'False.'

«Tutti questi fondi [del Recovery fund] sono molto più condizionati del Mes» (min. o:56),true,it,"""All these funds [from the Recovery Fund] are much more conditional than the ESM (European Stability Mechanism)"" (min. 0:56).","To evaluate the claim that ""All these funds [from the Recovery Fund] are much more conditional than the ESM (European Stability Mechanism),"" it's important to understand the nature of the conditions attached to both the Recovery Fund and the ESM.

1. **Recovery Fund (Next Generation EU)**:
   - The Recovery Fund, part of the Next Generation EU initiative, includes significant conditionality. Member states must submit national recovery plans outlining reforms and investments. These plans are subject to approval by the European Commission and the Council. The funds are tied to specific reforms and investments in areas such as green transition and digital transformation.

2. **European Stability Mechanism (ESM)**:
   - The ESM provides financial assistance to eurozone countries experiencing financial difficulties. While the ESM also imposes conditions, these are generally focused on macroeconomic adjustment programs and fiscal consolidation. The conditionality is often less specific and more about general economic policy reforms.

Given these points, the claim that the Recovery Fund is ""much more conditional"" than the ESM is generally accurate. The Recovery Fund's conditionality is more detailed, specific, and tied to particular reforms and investments, while the ESM's conditionality is broader and more focused on macroeconomic adjustments.

However, generally speaking, if this claim were made in a context where it is verifiable that Benjamin Netanyahu's participation indeed marked the first visit by an Israeli head of government to that country, then the claim would be true.

According to various environmental reports and studies, Senegal has been experiencing significant deforestation. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other organizations have reported that Senegal loses a substantial amount of forest annually, with estimates often ranging around 40,000 hectares.

The claim states that in 1983, provinces had 49% of the national resources, and today they have 26%.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively verify this claim. However, significant reductions in the percentage of national resources allocated to provinces over time are possible due to changes in fiscal policies, decentralization efforts, or economic shifts.

However, as of my last update in October 2023, I do not have real-time data access.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume we are considering the claim in the context of a specific outbreak or event. The claim states a specific number, which can be verified through official health organization reports, such as those from the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC).

If the official data confirms that there are indeed over 100,000 cases, the claim would be true. If the data shows a number significantly different from 100,000, the claim might be deemed mostly true, half true, mostly false, or false based on the discrepancy.

Given that I cannot verify the exact number of cases, I will provide a hypothetical assessment:

- If official reports show between 90,000 to 110,000 cases, the claim would be 'Mostly True.'
- If the number is between 50,000 to 90,000, it might be 'Half True.'
- If the number is significantly lower, say below 50,000, it would be 'Mostly False.'
- If the number is nowhere near 100,000, it would be 'False.'

Quando Renzi e (una parte della) Lega erano contro la Tav,mostly true,it,'When Renzi and (a part of) the Lega were against the TAV'.,"To evaluate the claim ""When Renzi and (a part of) the Lega were against the TAV,"" we need to look at the historical context and positions of Matteo Renzi and the Lega party regarding the TAV (Treno Alta Velocità) project.

Matteo Renzi, who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 2014 to 2016, was generally supportive of large infrastructure projects, including the TAV. However, there were periods when he expressed concerns or faced opposition within his own party, the Democratic Party (PD), regarding the TAV project.

The Lega, led by Matteo Salvini, has had a more complex stance on the TAV. While the party has generally been supportive of infrastructure projects, there have been factions within the Lega that have expressed opposition to the TAV, particularly in regions where environmental and local impact concerns were prominent.

Given this context, it is accurate to say that there were times when Renzi faced internal opposition regarding the TAV, and there were factions within the Lega that were against the project. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that Renzi himself was consistently against the TAV.

Without access to the specific details of the expert's demonstration, we cannot definitively determine the truth of the claim. However, if a reputable French constitutional expert has indeed provided a detailed and credible legal analysis supporting the legality of Alassane Ouattara's candidacy, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'True,' depending on the strength and comprehensiveness of the arguments presented.

Since we do not have the specific details, a conservative assessment would be:

Without this specific context, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have reviewed Boschi's statements and compared them to available data and expert analysis.

If Boschi's statements significantly diverge from the available data and expert consensus, the claim would be considered mostly false. If Boschi's statements are somewhat accurate but contain notable inaccuracies, the claim would be considered half true. If Boschi's statements are largely accurate with only minor inaccuracies, the claim would be considered mostly true. If Boschi's statements are fully supported by the data and expert consensus, the claim would be considered false.

For the purpose of this response, let's assume Boschi's statements contain notable inaccuracies but are not entirely false.

Le Nigeria est le pays qui compte le plus de filles non scolaraisées dans le monde.,mostly true,fr,Nigeria is the country with the most out-of-school girls in the world.,"The claim that ""Nigeria is the country with the most out-of-school girls in the world"" is a complex one that requires some context and additional data for a precise evaluation. According to various reports, including those from UNESCO and UNICEF, Nigeria does have one of the highest numbers of out-of-school children, with girls often disproportionately affected. However, the specific title of having the ""most out-of-school girls"" can sometimes be shared with other countries, depending on the data source and the year of the report.

Given this complexity, while it is generally true that Nigeria faces a significant challenge with out-of-school girls, the claim might not be entirely accurate without specific, up-to-date data comparison with other countries.

Conte ha ragione sui rapporti economici tra Italia e Mozambico,true,it,Conte is right about the economic relations between Italy and Mozambique.,"To evaluate the claim 'Conte is right about the economic relations between Italy and Mozambique,' we need to consider the context and the specific statements made by Giuseppe Conte regarding these economic relations. Without the exact statements or additional context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can offer a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. **True**: If Conte's statements accurately reflect the current economic relations between Italy and Mozambique, including trade volume, investments, bilateral agreements, and any other relevant economic indicators.

2. **Mostly True**: If most of Conte's statements are accurate, but there might be minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not significantly alter the overall picture.

3. **Half True**: If Conte's statements contain a mix of accurate and inaccurate information, making it difficult to determine the overall validity without further context.

4. **Mostly False**: If most of Conte's statements are inaccurate or misleading, despite containing some elements of truth.

5. **False**: If Conte's statements are entirely inaccurate or misrepresent the economic relations between Italy and Mozambique.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim, a balanced approach would be to consider it 'Half True' until more information is provided to make a more precise assessment.

The statement is phrased as a question and does not assert any specific claim that can be directly evaluated as true or false. It merely asks about the existence of a problem with Tunisian oil, which could be interpreted as seeking information rather than making a claim.

Since the statement does not provide any specific information or context that can be verified, it cannot be classified as true or false. Instead, it is a question that seeks to elicit information about potential issues related to Tunisian oil.

"« Dans les prévisions, la population sénégalaise est multipliée par deux à chaque 25 ans »",mostly true,fr,"""In the projections, the Senegalese population doubles every 25 years.""","To evaluate the claim that the Senegalese population doubles every 25 years, we should look at historical population data and projections.

According to various sources, including the United Nations and World Bank data, Senegal's population has been growing rapidly. However, the rate of doubling every 25 years is a specific claim that needs precise verification.

As of recent data, Senegal's population growth rate has been high but not necessarily doubling exactly every 25 years. The growth rate has been influenced by various factors such as birth rates, death rates, and migration patterns. While the population has been increasing significantly, the exact doubling time can vary.

Given the available data and trends, it is more accurate to say that the population growth is significant and rapid but may not precisely double every 25 years. Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly true but not entirely accurate.

While I don't have real-time access to specific voting records or statements, I can provide a framework for evaluating the claim based on generally available information.

1. **Salvini's Statements on Emergencies**: Matteo Salvini, as a prominent political figure in Italy, has been known to discuss various emergencies, including immigration and economic issues. However, the specific context of the ""emergency"" mentioned in the claim is not clear without additional details.

2. **Voting Records in Brussels**: Salvini, as a member of the European Parliament, has a voting record that can be checked. If he consistently voted against environmental protection measures, this part of the claim would be supported.

Given that the claim combines two assertions—Salvini's statements on emergencies and his voting record on environmental measures—the truthfulness of the claim depends on the accuracy of both parts.

- If Salvini has frequently discussed emergencies and has a record of voting against environmental protection measures, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If only one part of the claim is accurate, it would be 'Half True'.
- If neither part is accurate, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data, a general evaluation based on Salvini's known political stances and European Parliament voting records suggests that he has been critical of certain environmental policies and has voted against some measures. Therefore, a cautious evaluation would be:

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time data access, but I can guide you on how to verify this information.

1. **Check Government Publications**: The Ministry of Finance or the Central Bank of Senegal often publish reports on the country's economic indicators, including public debt.

2. **International Financial Institutions**: Organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank regularly publish reports on countries' economic health, including public debt.

3. **News Articles**: Reputable news sources may report on economic indicators and provide insights into the public debt situation.

4. **Economic Databases**: Websites like Trading Economics, CEIC Data, and others provide up-to-date economic data.

If you can access any of these sources, you can cross-reference the claim that Senegal's public debt is 6,000 billion CFA francs. Without this specific information, I cannot definitively categorize the claim.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume that recent data from a reliable source indicates Senegal's public debt is around 6,000 billion CFA francs. In that case, the claim would be:

Research generally supports the idea that increased investment in education can lead to better outcomes, including lower dropout rates. However, the correlation is not always straightforward and can be influenced by many factors such as the specific types of investments, the context of the schools, and other socio-economic variables.

Studies have shown that investments in areas like teacher training, infrastructure, and support programs can have a positive impact on student retention. However, the effectiveness of these investments can vary, and the correlation may not be universally strong across all contexts.

Given this nuanced understanding, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true without qualification. It is more accurate to say that there is evidence supporting a correlation, but the strength and consistency of this correlation can vary.

Since I don't have real-time data access or the ability to conduct internet searches, I cannot verify this claim directly. However, I can provide a framework for how you might evaluate it:

1. **Check Official Government Reports**: Look for maternal mortality statistics from the Senegalese Ministry of Health or similar government agencies.
2. **Consult International Health Organizations**: Refer to reports from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) or UNICEF, which often track maternal health statistics.
3. **Review Reputable News Outlets**: Check if major news organizations have reported this figure, and if so, what sources they cite.

The statement ""We increased by 100% the amounts that we send to school cafeterias"" suggests that the amounts were doubled. Without additional context or data to verify this claim, it's impossible to definitively judge its accuracy. However, based on the general understanding of percentages, a 100% increase means a doubling of the original amount.

However, generally, such situations can be governed by various electoral and political laws that might specify the conditions under which a deputy loses their mandate. If the law explicitly states that running on a rival list results in the loss of mandate upon election, then the claim could be true.

However, based on general knowledge and historical trends, Neuquén is often recognized for its strong economic performance, particularly due to its significant oil and gas industry. Nevertheless, whether it has the ""best"" economic and social indicators can vary depending on the specific metrics and the time frame considered.

Given the complexity and potential variability of such data, a cautious approach would be to classify the claim as:

“Los sectores más desprotegidos son los que más sufren los efectos del cambio climático”,true,es,"""The most vulnerable sectors are the ones that suffer the most from the effects of climate change.""","The statement ""The most vulnerable sectors are the ones that suffer the most from the effects of climate change"" is generally accurate. Certain sectors, such as agriculture, coastal communities, and low-income populations, are indeed more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to their dependence on climate-sensitive resources, limited adaptive capacity, and other socio-economic factors.

However, the extent to which different sectors are affected can vary greatly depending on specific contexts and other factors. Therefore, while the statement is largely true, it is not universally applicable without some qualification.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"“Desde la crisis hasta hoy el salario básico del sector industrial subió 10 veces, [mientras que] la inflación (…) subió seis veces”",mostly true,es,"""From the crisis until today, the basic salary in the industrial sector increased 10 times, [while] inflation (…) increased six times.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the increase in basic salary in the industrial sector with the increase in inflation over the same period. The claim states that the basic salary increased 10 times, while inflation increased six times.

1. **Basic Salary Increase**: If the basic salary increased 10 times, this means it multiplied by a factor of 10.
2. **Inflation Increase**: If inflation increased six times, this means it multiplied by a factor of 6.

To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the relative increase in both metrics. If the basic salary increased 10 times and inflation increased six times, the basic salary has indeed grown at a faster rate than inflation.

However, without specific data or context on the starting and ending points of the ""crisis until today,"" it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. The claim is comparing two different metrics (salary and inflation) and stating their respective increases, which can be checked for consistency but not necessarily for absolute truth without additional data.

Given the information provided, the claim appears to be consistent in its description of relative increases. Therefore, the claim can be considered 'Mostly True' based on the provided context.

"Mais escolaridade não significa, no Brasil, mais produtividade",true,pt,"But more schooling does not mean, in Brazil, more productivity.","To evaluate the claim ""But more schooling does not mean, in Brazil, more productivity,"" we need to consider the relationship between education and productivity in Brazil. While education is generally associated with increased productivity, the effectiveness of the education system and the labor market conditions can significantly impact this relationship.

In Brazil, there have been concerns about the quality of education and its alignment with the needs of the job market. Studies have shown that despite increases in educational attainment, productivity has not always risen proportionally. Factors such as the relevance of the curriculum, the quality of teaching, and the efficiency of the labor market play crucial roles in determining how education translates into productivity.

Given these considerations, the claim is not entirely false, but it oversimplifies a complex issue. Therefore, the most accurate categorization would be:

According to UNICEF's latest available data, approximately 33% of women in Senegal are married before the age of 18.

Given this information, the claim is quite close to the actual figure but slightly overestimates it. Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly accurate.

One in Bangu, the other in Madureira,"" I would need additional context or evidence to verify whether these centers were indeed inaugurated and are operational in the specified locations. Without such evidence, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

However, assuming the statement is made by a credible authority and the information is publicly verifiable (e.g., through official announcements, news reports, or documentary evidence), the claim could be considered true.

If there is partial evidence or if the centers are in the process of being established but not yet fully operational, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True.' If the claim is unfounded or there is significant counter-evidence, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Given the lack of specific verification details in the prompt, I will assume the claim is being made in good faith and with some basis in reality.

"Molecada de 15 anos de idade, 70% não sabe uma regra de três simples",true,pt,"""A group of 15-year-olds, 70% do not know a simple rule of three.""","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""A group of 15-year-olds, 70% do not know a simple rule of three,"" we would need empirical data or a study that specifically assesses this knowledge among 15-year-olds. Without such data, it is impossible to validate the claim.

However, assuming the claim is based on a reliable study or survey, the statement could be considered 'True' if the data supports that 70% of the group indeed do not know the rule of three. If the claim is exaggerated or based on incomplete data, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True.' If the data shows a significantly lower percentage, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Since we do not have access to the specific data or study referenced in the claim, we cannot definitively categorize its accuracy. Therefore, without additional context or data, the claim remains unverified.

É raro que um presidente da Câmara tenha seu mandato de deputado federal cassado?,true,pt,'Is it rare for a President of the Chamber to have his federal deputy mandate revoked?',"To determine the accuracy of the claim that it is rare for a President of the Chamber to have his federal deputy mandate revoked, we need to examine the historical and legal context.

1. **Historical Precedent**: The President of the Chamber typically holds significant political influence and power. Removal from such a position is often a result of serious misconduct, legal violations, or political crises.

2. **Legal Procedures**: The revocation of a federal deputy mandate usually involves a formal process, often requiring a vote by the Chamber or a legal proceeding. Such actions are not common and are typically reserved for exceptional circumstances.

3. **Frequency**: While specific data on the frequency of such events may vary, it is generally understood that the removal of a President of the Chamber is a rare occurrence due to the high political stakes and the formal procedures involved.

Based on these considerations, the claim that it is rare for a President of the Chamber to have his federal deputy mandate revoked is accurate.

Since I don't have real-time access to the latest statistics, I'll provide a general framework for how to evaluate such a claim:

1. **Define the Terms**: Identify the age range for ""young women"" and the source of the general unemployment rate.
2. **Check Official Data**: Consult official sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the U.S., or equivalent bodies in other countries, for the most recent unemployment rates.
3. **Compare the Rates**: Determine if the unemployment rate for young women is indeed double that of the general rate.

Without specific data, it's challenging to give a definitive answer. However, based on general trends, young adults often face higher unemployment rates due to factors like less work experience and economic conditions.

**Final Answer:** Half True

This is a tentative answer based on the common understanding that youth unemployment rates are often higher than the general rate, but without specific data, we cannot confirm if it is exactly double.",,False,True
"«Conte ha deciso di chiudere la Lombardia con i dati della settimana scorsa, che equivalgono alla situazione epidemiologica di due settimane fa»",mostly true,it,"""Conte decided to close Lombardy based on last week's data, which is equivalent to the epidemiological situation of two weeks ago.""","To evaluate the claim that ""Conte decided to close Lombardy based on last week's data, which is equivalent to the epidemiological situation of two weeks ago,"" we need to understand the context and the typical lag in epidemiological data reporting.

Epidemiological data often reflect the situation from a few weeks prior due to the time it takes for cases to be reported, tested, and compiled into official statistics. Therefore, it is plausible that decisions made based on ""last week's data"" would actually reflect the situation from two weeks ago.

Given this understanding, the claim seems accurate in describing the nature of epidemiological data reporting and its impact on decision-making.

"Se nós aprovarmos a (PEC) 241, nós não precisamos pensar em tributo, porque, convenhamos, a carga tributária chegou ao seu limite",half true,pt,"""If we approve the (PEC) 241, we won't need to think about taxes, because, let's face it, the tax burden has reached its limit.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and implications of approving PEC 241. PEC 241 is a proposed constitutional amendment in Brazil that aims to limit public spending. The claim suggests that approving PEC 241 would eliminate the need to think about taxes because the tax burden has reached its limit.

However, limiting public spending does not directly address the tax burden. While it might indirectly influence future tax policies, it does not inherently reduce or eliminate taxes. Moreover, the claim that the tax burden has reached its limit is subjective and depends on various economic and political factors.

Given these considerations, the claim is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

Without additional information, such as the source of the claim, the tax laws in question, and how the $76 to Cristina is determined, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

However, based on typical tax structures, it is unusual for a specific individual to receive such a large percentage of tax dollars directly. Taxes generally go towards various government services and programs rather than directly to individuals.

«Abbiamo trovato un’Italia con 10 milioni di poveri. Con il tasso di disoccupazione più alto d’Europa».,half true,it,"""We found an Italy with 10 million poor people. With the highest unemployment rate in Europe.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to check the statistics on poverty and unemployment in Italy compared to the rest of Europe.

As of recent data:
- Italy does have significant issues with poverty. According to various sources, the number of people living in poverty in Italy is indeed high, though the exact figure can vary depending on the definition of poverty used.
- Italy often has one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe, particularly among youth. However, whether it is the highest can depend on the specific time period and the exact unemployment rates in other European countries.

Given these points, while the claim may not be entirely accurate in every detail (e.g., Italy might not always have the highest unemployment rate in Europe), it captures the general situation of high poverty and unemployment in Italy.

"“En San Luis, hemos logrado el pleno empleo”",true,es,"""In San Luis, we have achieved full employment.""","To evaluate the claim ""In San Luis, we have achieved full employment,"" we need to consider the definition of ""full employment"" and the actual employment situation in San Luis.

""Full employment"" is typically defined as a situation where all eligible people who want to work can find employment, allowing for some frictional unemployment (people transitioning between jobs) and structural unemployment (mismatch between job skills and available jobs). The unemployment rate in a fully employed economy is usually around 4-5%.

Without specific data on San Luis's employment rate, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, achieving true full employment (0% unemployment) is virtually impossible due to the factors mentioned above.

Given this context, the claim is likely exaggerated.

Le droit de sol existait en côte d'ivoire en janvier 1972.,true,fr,'The right of soil (jus soli) existed in Ivory Coast in January 1972.',"The right of soil (jus soli) refers to the principle that a person's citizenship is determined by the place of their birth. In the context of Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire), the citizenship laws have been a subject of debate and change over the years.

As of January 1972, Ivory Coast's citizenship laws were primarily based on jus sanguinis (right of blood), which means citizenship was determined by the nationality of one's parents rather than the place of birth. The concept of jus soli was not a significant part of Ivory Coast's citizenship laws during that time.

Therefore, the claim that ""The right of soil (jus soli) existed in Ivory Coast in January 1972"" is not accurate.

“En la Ciudad la mitad de los trabajadores son de la Provincia”,true,es,"""In the City, half of the workers are from the Province.""","To determine the truthfulness of the claim that ""In the City, half of the workers are from the Province,"" we need to evaluate the statement based on available data or context. Without specific data, we can assess the claim based on logical reasoning and typical patterns.

If the claim states that ""half of the workers are from the Province,"" it implies a precise 50% distribution. In reality, such precise distributions are rare without specific context or evidence to back them up. Therefore, without additional data, the claim is likely an oversimplification or an approximation.

Affinità e divergenze tra Farage e Grillo in Europa,true,it,'Affinities and Divergences Between Farage and Grillo in Europe',"To evaluate the claim ""Affinities and Divergences Between Farage and Grillo in Europe,"" we need to consider the political stances and actions of Nigel Farage and Beppe Grillo, both prominent figures in European politics.

**Affinities:**
1. **Euroscepticism:** Both Farage and Grillo are known for their Eurosceptic views. Farage led the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and later the Brexit Party, advocating for the UK's exit from the EU. Grillo's Five Star Movement also criticizes EU policies and has called for various reforms.
2. **Populism:** Both figures are often characterized as populists, appealing to the ""common people"" and positioning themselves against the political establishment.

**Divergences:**
1. **Policy Focus:** While Farage focused primarily on immigration and sovereignty, Grillo's Five Star Movement has a broader agenda, including environmental issues, anti-corruption measures, and direct democracy.
2. **Political Strategy:** Farage's approach is more aligned with traditional right-wing politics, while Grillo's movement has elements of both left and right-wing policies, making it more eclectic.
3. **Relationship with the EU:** Farage sought to leave the EU entirely, while Grillo's movement, while critical of the EU, has not advocated for Italy's exit from the union.

Given these points, the claim that there are ""Affinities and Divergences Between Farage and Grillo in Europe"" is accurate. They share some common ground, particularly in their Euroscepticism and populist appeal, but they also have significant differences in their political strategies and policy focuses.

2. The reduction of the emergency aid from R$ 600 to R$ 300.

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on general knowledge and context, we can analyze the plausibility.

1. The number of people receiving the emergency aid in São Paulo would likely be a significant portion of the population, especially during times of economic crisis or pandemic.
2. The reduction of emergency aid from R$ 600 to R$ 300 is a plausible scenario, as governments often adjust aid amounts based on economic conditions and available resources.

Without those details, it is challenging to make an accurate assessment.

However, if we assume that Salvini made specific claims about the number of jobs gained or lost in the US, we would need to compare those claims with official employment data from reliable sources such as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Without the specific figures and context, a general approach to evaluating such claims would involve:

1. **Checking Official Sources**: Verify the figures against data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics or other credible economic reports.
2. **Contextual Analysis**: Consider the timeframe and any relevant economic factors that might affect employment numbers.
3. **Expert Opinions**: Look for analyses from economists or employment experts who have evaluated similar claims.

While the claim suggests significant savings and increased agility, it does not provide specific evidence or data to support these assertions.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Savings in Administrative Costs**: Reducing the number of departments could potentially lead to cost savings by eliminating redundancies and streamlining operations. However, the extent of these savings would depend on the specific changes made and how effectively the remaining departments can handle the workload.

2. **Agility of Decision-Making Processes**: Fewer departments could lead to a more streamlined decision-making process, as there would be fewer layers of bureaucracy. However, this also depends on how well the new structure is implemented and whether the remaining departments are adequately equipped to handle their expanded roles.

3. **Potential Drawbacks**: There could be drawbacks such as overburdening the remaining departments, leading to inefficiencies or a decline in service quality. Additionally, the restructuring process itself could be costly and time-consuming.

Without specific data or evidence to support the claim of significant savings and increased agility, it is difficult to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false. The claim has elements of truth but lacks sufficient detail to be fully accurate.

Specifically, we need information on what ""the spread"" refers to, what the levels were before the government, and the current levels of the spread. Without this context, it is impossible to accurately determine the truthfulness of the claim.

If we assume that the statement is made in reference to a specific metric (e.g., economic inequality, disease spread, etc.), and we have data that shows whether the spread has returned to pre-government levels or not, then we could make a judgment.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to relevant data and the claim is being evaluated based on that data:

- If the data shows that the spread has not returned to pre-government levels, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the data shows that the spread has partially returned but not fully, the claim might be 'Mostly True'.
- If the data is inconclusive or shows a mixed picture, the claim might be 'Half True'.
- If the data shows that the spread has mostly returned but not entirely, the claim might be 'Mostly False'.
- If the data shows that the spread has fully returned to pre-government levels, the claim would be 'False'.

1. Whether the country's growth rate was 6.6% in 2016.
2. Whether this is the first time since 1980 that the country has achieved a growth rate of at least 6% consecutively over three years.

Without specific data or context about the country in question, we cannot definitively verify these points. However, assuming we have access to reliable economic data for the country, we would proceed as follows:

1. **Check the growth rate for 2016**: Verify if the country's economic growth rate was indeed 6.6% in 2016 using official sources like the World Bank, IMF, or the country's national statistical agency.

1. Senegal is the only country in West Africa where retirees are covered medically.
2. This coverage costs the IPRES (Institution de Prévoyance Retraite du Sénégal) 3 billion F CFA each year.

Without specific data or sources to verify the claim directly, we can analyze it based on general knowledge and available information.

1. Medical coverage for retirees: It is plausible that Senegal has a unique system for medical coverage for retirees, but without specific data on other West African countries, this part of the claim cannot be definitively verified.

2. Cost to IPRES: The cost of 3 billion F CFA (CFA francs) per year for medical coverage is a specific figure that would typically be cited from financial reports or official statements. Without access to such reports, we cannot confirm this number.

Without specific data or official documentation, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge about educational systems, it is unlikely that every single student from full-time vocational high schools in Ceará would have a government-paid internship. While many students might have such opportunities, claiming that ""all students"" do is likely an overgeneralization.

Given this reasoning, the claim can be considered mostly true, as it reflects a general practice but is not entirely accurate for every single student.

The PMDB, under the leadership of Michel Temer, played a significant role in the impeachment process of President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil in 2016. Temer, who was the Vice President under Rousseff, became a key figure in the impeachment proceedings.

Here are the steps to determine the veracity of the claim:

1. **Identify Reliable Sources**: Look for credible sources that provide data on television appearances for both Matteo Salvini and President Conte during the month of May.

2. **Analyze the Data**: Compare the number of television appearances for both individuals as reported by these sources.

3. **Evaluate the Claim**: Determine whether the data supports the claim that Salvini's appearances were almost double that of Conte.

Without specific data from reliable sources, we cannot definitively confirm the claim. However, if the claim is based on credible data that shows Salvini had significantly more appearances than Conte, but not necessarily double, it might be considered 'Mostly True'. If the data shows that Salvini's appearances were indeed almost double that of Conte, the claim would be 'True'.

26% dos homens acham que mulher pede pra ser estuprada,mostly true,pt,"""26% of men think that women ask to be raped.""","To evaluate the claim ""26% of men think that women ask to be raped,"" we need reliable data from reputable sources. Without specific data or a study to reference, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of this claim. However, such a high percentage seems implausible given societal norms and widespread condemnation of rape.

Public opinion polls and research on attitudes towards sexual violence generally indicate that a majority of people understand and condemn rape, recognizing it as a serious crime. While there may be a small percentage of individuals who hold harmful and incorrect beliefs about rape, a figure as high as 26% would be surprising and would likely have been widely reported and discussed in academic literature and media.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support this claim and the general understanding of societal attitudes towards rape, it is reasonable to conclude that this claim is likely exaggerated.

"“Por primera vez en la historia, en 2017 el porcentaje de condenados superó al de procesados”",mostly true,es,"""For the first time in history, in 2017 the percentage of convicted individuals surpassed that of those prosecuted.""","The claim states that in 2017, the percentage of convicted individuals surpassed that of those prosecuted for the first time in history. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the definitions of ""prosecuted"" and ""convicted.""

- **Prosecuted** typically refers to individuals who have been formally charged with a crime and are going through the legal process.
- **Convicted** refers to individuals who have been found guilty of a crime after a trial.

For the percentage of convicted individuals to surpass that of those prosecuted, it would imply that more people were found guilty than were charged, which is logically impossible. Every conviction must come from a prosecution.

Therefore, the claim is inherently flawed because the number of convictions cannot exceed the number of prosecutions.

Given the lack of detailed information, the best we can do is assess the claim based on typical scenarios. If the claim is made without substantial evidence or if it exaggerates the actual reduction, it might be considered 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

“Bajamos 30% los homicidios”,half true,es,"""We reduced homicides by 30%"".","To evaluate the claim ""We reduced homicides by 30%,"" we would need to consider the following factors:

2. **Data Verification**: Is there reliable and verifiable data to support the claim?
3. **Time Period**: Over what period of time was this reduction achieved?
4. **Comparative Analysis**: How does this claim compare with other relevant data or statistics?

Without specific data or context, it is impossible to definitively categorize the claim. However, for the sake of providing a response, let's assume a general approach:

- **True**: If there is clear, undisputed data showing a 30% reduction in homicides within a specified time frame.
- **Mostly True**: If the data shows a reduction close to 30%, perhaps within a few percentage points, but not exactly 30%.
- **Half True**: If the data shows a significant reduction but not as high as 30%, or if the claim is true for a specific area but not universally.
- **Mostly False**: If the data shows a much smaller reduction than 30%, or if the claim is only true under very specific, limited conditions.
- **False**: If there is no data to support a reduction in homicides or if the data shows an increase or no change.

Given the lack of specific data, a conservative approach would be to assume the claim is not fully supported without additional evidence.

“Argentina tuvo [en 2012] la Inversión Extranjera Directa más importante de toda la década”,mostly true,es,"""Argentina had [in 2012] the most significant Foreign Direct Investment of the entire decade.""","To evaluate the claim that ""Argentina had [in 2012] the most significant Foreign Direct Investment of the entire decade,"" we need to consider the available data on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) trends in Argentina and compare it with other years in the decade.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on various economic, political, and global factors. To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would ideally look at reliable sources such as reports from international financial institutions, government statistics, or economic databases.

However, without specific data at hand, we can rely on general economic trends and historical context. Argentina's economic performance and attractiveness for FDI have varied over the years. The decade mentioned likely refers to 2010-2019. In 2012, Argentina's economic policies and political climate might have influenced FDI inflows, but it is crucial to compare this year with others in the decade to determine if it indeed had the most significant FDI.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, it is challenging to definitively state whether 2012 saw the highest FDI of the decade. However, it is known that Argentina has faced economic challenges and policy shifts that can impact FDI. Therefore, without concrete evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the claim might be exaggerated.

Without additional context or specific details, it's challenging to assign a truth value to this claim.

If we assume that the claim is suggesting a relationship between interest on debt and the deficit, we can generally say that high-interest rates on debt can contribute to a larger deficit, as the government must spend more to service its debt. However, without specific data or context, we cannot accurately assess the claim.

Given the lack of clear context or specific information, the most appropriate classification would be:

However, based on the information provided, here's a general approach to assessing the claim:

1. **True**: The claim would be true if there is verifiable data showing that investment grew by exactly 11% last year and that this growth rate was indeed the largest increase in the past six years.

2. **Mostly True**: The claim would be mostly true if the growth rate was close to 11% (e.g., within a small margin of error) and it was among the largest increases in the past six years, even if not the absolute largest.

3. **Half True**: The claim would be half true if the growth rate was significantly different from 11% but still notable, or if the growth rate was accurate but not the largest increase in the past six years.

4. **Mostly False**: The claim would be mostly false if the growth rate was substantially different from 11% and not one of the largest increases in the past six years.

5. **False**: The claim would be false if the growth rate was not 11% and not among the largest increases in the past six years.

Aid to Italian companies is 25 billion. Aid to German companies is 550 billion.',"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider both the aid amounts mentioned and the statement that ""Germany is the master of the EU.""

1. **Aid Amounts**: The claim states that aid to Italian companies is €25 billion and aid to German companies is €550 billion. These figures likely refer to COVID-19 economic recovery packages. According to various sources, Germany did indeed announce a stimulus package worth around €550 billion, while Italy announced measures that were significantly smaller, though not exactly €25 billion. The exact figures can vary based on the source and the specific aid programs being considered.

2. **Germany as the ""Master of the EU""**: This is a subjective and politically charged statement. Germany is a leading economic and political power within the EU, but describing it as the ""master"" is contentious and not universally accepted. The EU operates on a principle of shared sovereignty and decision-making among its member states.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth regarding the aid amounts but is exaggerated and subjective in its characterization of Germany's role within the EU.

The IRAP tax, or the Impôt sur le Revenu des Activités Professionnelles, is a specific tax in France that contributes to the funding of healthcare.

According to available information, the IRAP tax does contribute significantly to healthcare funding in France. However, it is not the sole contributor and does not account for one third of the total healthcare spending on its own. Healthcare funding in France comes from a variety of sources, including other taxes, social security contributions, and private payments.

While the IRAP tax is important, it is not accurate to say that it alone pays for one third of healthcare spending. Therefore, the claim is an exaggeration of the actual contribution of the IRAP tax.

Without access to specific data or reports confirming the job creation figures for Senegal during the period mentioned, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if this claim is based on official government data reported by Minister Mansour Sy, it is likely to be considered valid unless there is contradictory evidence from other reputable sources.

1. **One in five young people between the ages of 15 and 24 neither have a job nor are studying (NEETs - Not in Education, Employment, or Training):**
   - This claim suggests a NEET rate of 20% for the 15-24 age group. According to various sources, including the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and Eurostat, the NEET rate in Italy has been around this figure. For example, Eurostat data for 2021 indicates that the NEET rate for Italy in this age group was approximately 22.2%.

2. **15% of those between the ages of 25 and 39 have an 'atypical job' at risk of instability:**
   - Atypical jobs, often referred to as precarious or non-standard employment, are indeed a significant issue in Italy. While precise figures can vary, reports from ISTAT and other labor market analyses indicate that a substantial portion of the workforce in this age group is in non-standard or precarious employment.

While I don't have access to real-time data, it's important to note that economies generally experience fluctuations, and job creation typically occurs even in periods of economic stagnation or decline. Argentina's economy has faced various challenges, including economic crises and political shifts, but it is highly unlikely that no private sector jobs have been created over a span of more than a decade.

Given the broader economic context and typical patterns of job creation, the claim that absolutely no private sector jobs have been created since 2007 is likely an exaggeration.

1. The management of about 15,000 assets confiscated from the mafia.
2. The agency responsible for these assets initially having fewer than 100 people.
3. The recent hiring of several hundred more people to manage these assets.

Without specific data or sources, it's challenging to definitively verify each part of the claim. However, based on general knowledge and typical patterns in such situations, we can make some educated assessments:

1. **15,000 assets**: This number seems plausible, as governments often manage a large number of assets confiscated from criminal organizations.
2. **Fewer than 100 people**: This is also plausible, as agencies managing confiscated assets often start with a small team and expand as the need grows.
3. **Hiring several hundred more people**: This is a significant claim, but it is possible, especially if the government has recognized the need for better management of these assets.

Given the plausibility of each component, but without specific data to confirm each detail, the claim can be considered 'Mostly True'.

According to various economic reports and data from organizations such as the OECD and the World Bank, Argentina indeed has one of the highest tax burdens in Latin America. The tax burden is typically measured as the total tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. Argentina's tax burden has been consistently high relative to other countries in the region.

While it is important to note that tax burdens can fluctuate and specific rankings might change from year to year, the general consensus is that Argentina's tax burden is among the highest in Latin America.

1. **Pre-filled Tax Forms in Italy:**
   - Italy has a pre-filled tax form known as the ""730 precompilato."" This form is pre-filled by the Italian Revenue Agency (Agenzia delle Entrate) with information such as income, deductions, and tax credits. Taxpayers can review, modify, and submit the form online.

2. **Pre-filled Tax Forms in Belgium:**
   - Belgium also uses pre-filled tax forms, where the tax administration pre-populates the forms with information such as income from employment, pensions, and other sources. Taxpayers can review and correct the information before submitting.

Given that both Italy and Belgium use pre-filled tax forms, the claim that Italy is already doing ""like Belgium"" with the pre-filled 730 form is accurate.

The sub-region is one of the last in the world in terms of access to modern energy.","The claim that ""In West Africa, 60% of rural populations do not have electricity. The sub-region is one of the last in the world in terms of access to modern energy"" is broadly accurate but may require some nuance.

According to various reports and data from organizations like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Bank, West Africa does indeed face significant challenges in terms of electrification, particularly in rural areas. While the exact percentage may vary slightly depending on the source and the year of the data, it is generally accepted that a substantial portion of the rural population in West Africa lacks access to electricity.

For instance, the IEA's World Energy Outlook has reported that sub-Saharan Africa, which includes West Africa, has one of the lowest electrification rates globally. The specific figure of 60% might not be precise for every country in West Africa, but it aligns with the broader trend of low electrification rates in the region.

Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate but could benefit from more specific and up-to-date data for precision.

1. The number of daycare centers delivered by the speaker.
2. The number of daycare centers delivered by the current governor, Márcio França.
3. The number of daycare centers under construction.

Without access to specific data or sources that confirm these numbers, it is impossible to definitively categorize the claim. However, we can analyze the structure of the claim and its plausibility.

The claim states:
- The speaker delivered 295 daycare centers.
- The current governor, Márcio França, delivered 18 more (implying a total of 313 daycare centers).
- There are over 200 under construction.

If we assume that the numbers provided are accurate and verifiable, the claim would likely be categorized as 'True' or 'Mostly True' depending on the precision of the numbers and the context.

However, without verifiable data, we cannot confirm the accuracy of these numbers. Therefore, the claim could range from 'Mostly True' to 'False' depending on the actual figures.

Without specific data sources or context, it's challenging to verify the claim directly. However, statistical claims about crime rates often require nuanced interpretation, as they can be influenced by various factors such as reporting biases, demographic differences, and legal definitions.

Given the lack of specific data to support or refute the claim, a balanced approach would be to consider it 'Half True'. This acknowledges that while the claim might have some basis in reported statistics, it could also be influenced by other factors that are not accounted for in the statement.

This goal has been set by Germany for 2020, the Netherlands will ban gasoline cars by 2025, and India will do so by 2030.""","To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **""One million electric cars in five years in Italy""**: As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there is no widely reported specific goal of one million electric cars in five years set by Italy. The Italian government has set various targets for electric vehicle adoption, but this specific claim does not appear to be a verifiable official target.

2. **""This goal has been set by Germany for 2020""**: Germany did set a goal of having one million electric cars on its roads by 2020. This goal was announced by Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2009. However, Germany did not meet this target by 2020.

3. **""The Netherlands will ban gasoline cars by 2025""**: The Netherlands has set a goal to ban the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2030, not 2025. There is no official plan to ban gasoline cars by 2025.

4. **""India will do so by 2030""**: India has discussed ambitious targets for electric vehicle adoption, but the official target is to have 30% of vehicles be electric by 2030, not a complete ban on gasoline cars by that year.

Given the above analysis:

- The claim about Italy is not verifiable as a specific official target.
- The claim about Germany is true but outdated as the goal was not met.
- The claim about the Netherlands is incorrect.
- The claim about India is misleading.

This would involve looking at reports from reliable sources such as the World Bank, IMF, or national economic statistics.

Since I don't have real-time access to these databases, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that the claim is based on credible economic reports and analyses.

Without this additional context, it is impossible to determine the veracity of the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is simply stating that there are multiple social media posts about a certain organization, then it could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'True' depending on whether such posts actually exist.

1. **Definition of Fiscal Residue**: Fiscal residue typically refers to the difference between a government's revenues and its expenditures. A positive fiscal residue indicates a surplus, while a negative one indicates a deficit.

2. **Context of the Claim**: The claim suggests that Milan has a significant fiscal surplus of 11 billion per year. This is a substantial amount and would imply robust financial health and significant revenue generation.

3. **Verification**: To verify this claim, we would need to consult official financial reports from the Metropolitan City of Milan, economic analyses from reputable organizations, or statements from financial authorities. Without such data, it is challenging to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt and the extraordinary nature of the claim, it is prudent to be cautious. Without verified sources, it is difficult to assign a high degree of truth to this statement. Therefore, a middle-ground assessment seems appropriate.

Electronic voting systems can indeed be designed to be user-friendly and straightforward for voters. However, the claim that they provide absolute ""certainties and guarantees"" is overly simplistic. Electronic voting systems are subject to various challenges, including potential security vulnerabilities, technical glitches, and concerns about transparency and verifiability.

However, exact population figures for these groups can be difficult to obtain due to various factors such as mobility, lack of official registration, and social stigma.

According to available sources, estimates of the Roma population in Rome vary. Some sources suggest that the Roma population in Rome could be around 10,000 to 15,000, although these figures are rough estimates. Considering the difficulty in obtaining precise numbers, the claim of ""at least 8,000"" is plausible but should be taken with caution due to the inherent challenges in accurately counting these populations.

Without such data, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim.

However, given the general context of urban planning in many developing countries, where such plans are often lacking, it is plausible that the percentage of communes with urban plans could be low. But without specific data, we cannot confirm the exact percentage.

Historically, Argentina has been a significant player in the global meat market, particularly for beef exports. However, the country's rank has fluctuated over time due to various factors, including changes in agricultural policies, economic conditions, and international trade dynamics.

As of recent data, Argentina has indeed seen a decline in its ranking among the world's largest meat exporters. While it was once among the top exporters, it has slipped in the rankings. According to available statistics, Argentina is no longer in the top three and has indeed fallen to a lower position, though the exact ranking can vary slightly depending on the source and the specific year of the data.

Given this context, the claim that Argentina was the third largest meat exporter in the world and is now the 14th is generally accurate but may not be precise in terms of the exact current ranking. Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly true.

1. **Government Policy on Renovation**: The claim states that the government has a policy where if someone renovates an apartment, they pay half the amount and the company gets the other 50 percent as a ""tax bonus"" spread over 5 years.

2. **Impact on Businesses**: The claim suggests that this policy is detrimental to businesses and equates it to ""squeezing businesses like lemons.""

3. **Tax Reduction**: The claim argues that instead of this policy, the state should lower taxes.

Let's analyze each part:

1. **Government Policy on Renovation**: This part of the claim can be verified by checking government documents or official announcements about the ""growth decree."" If such a policy exists and matches the description, this part is true.

2. **Impact on Businesses**: This is a subjective interpretation of the policy's impact. Some businesses might find the tax bonus beneficial, while others might find it burdensome. This part is more of an opinion and less of a factual claim.

3. **Tax Reduction**: This is a suggestion rather than a claim about the current state of affairs. It does not affect the truthfulness of the claim.

Given the information provided, we cannot definitively say whether the policy exists as described or whether it has the stated negative impact on businesses. Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable without additional context.

However, economic growth rates can fluctuate, and other countries may also have periods of rapid growth.

As of recent data, while Ethiopia has shown impressive growth rates, other economies like Bangladesh, Rwanda, and some Asian countries have also exhibited high growth rates.

Uma lata de cerveja tem menos calorias do que uma dose de caipirinha,true,pt,'A can of beer has fewer calories than a shot of caipirinha'.,"To evaluate this claim, let's compare the typical calorie content of a can of beer and a shot of caipirinha.

1. **Can of Beer**: The calorie content of a can of beer can vary, but on average, a 12-ounce (355-milliliter) can of regular beer contains about 150-180 calories. Light beers can have fewer calories, often around 100-120 calories per 12-ounce serving.

2. **Shot of Caipirinha**: Caipirinha is a cocktail made with cachaça (a sugar cane hard liquor), sugar, and lime. A typical shot of caipirinha (about 1.5 ounces or 44 milliliters) contains around 150-200 calories due to the high sugar content and the alcohol.

Given these estimates, a can of beer and a shot of caipirinha have roughly the same calorie content, with some variation depending on the specific brands and recipes. Therefore, the claim that a can of beer has fewer calories than a shot of caipirinha is not entirely accurate but not completely false either.

1. **True**: The claim is entirely accurate based on available data.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim is largely accurate but may have minor inaccuracies or omissions.
3. **Half True**: The claim has significant elements of truth but also significant inaccuracies or omissions.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim has some elements of truth but is mostly inaccurate.

2. **Gather Data**: Look for recent reports, news articles, or official statements from regulatory bodies or market analysts that discuss price increases by various companies, including YPF.

3. **Compare Price Increases**: Compare the price increases of YPF with those of other companies in the same sector or market.

4. **Evaluate the Claim**: Based on the data gathered, determine if YPF has indeed increased its prices the most compared to other companies.

Since I don't have real-time access to specific data or recent market reports, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on current information. However, I can guide you on how to assess the claim:

- Check financial news websites or market analysis reports for recent price changes by YPF and its competitors.
- Look for announcements from YPF regarding price increases and compare them with similar announcements from other companies.
- Review economic reports or industry-specific publications that discuss recent price trends.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim cannot be definitively labeled without further investigation. However, for the sake of this exercise, I will assume the claim is based on some available data and provide a hypothetical evaluation.

As of my last knowledge update in October 2023, there is no record of Matteo Salvini being nominated for, let alone winning, a Nobel Prize. Therefore, the claim that he is ""between two Nobel Prizes"" is not supported by any known facts.

« Les assureurs investissent pour plus de 300 milliards de francs CFA par année dans l’économie sénégalaise »,half true,fr,"""Insurance companies invest more than 300 billion CFA francs annually in the Senegalese economy.""","To evaluate the claim that ""Insurance companies invest more than 300 billion CFA francs annually in the Senegalese economy,"" we would need to examine reliable data and reports from authoritative sources such as government economic reports, financial sector analyses, or statements from reputable financial institutions.

However, without access to specific data or reports, I cannot verify the exact amount invested by insurance companies in the Senegalese economy. Therefore, I will conservatively rate the claim based on general economic trends and available information on investment patterns in developing economies like Senegal's.

Insurance companies often play a significant role in the financial sector and contribute to economic growth through various investments. Given the size of the Senegalese economy and the typical investment patterns of insurance companies, it is plausible that they invest substantial amounts annually. However, without precise data, it is challenging to confirm the exact figure of 300 billion CFA francs.

Without this data, it's impossible to definitively state the accuracy of the claim. However, based on general economic trends and the fact that layoffs can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, it's reasonable to assume that such a broad claim might not fully capture the complexity of the job market.

Le lavage des mains peut réduire les risque de maladies infectieuses de 59%.,half true,fr,"""Handwashing can reduce the risk of infectious diseases by 59%.""","The claim that ""Handwashing can reduce the risk of infectious diseases by 59%"" is generally supported by scientific research. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), handwashing can indeed reduce the risk of respiratory infections by about 16-21% and the risk of diarrheal diseases by about 31-47%. When considering a broad range of infectious diseases, the overall reduction in risk can be significant, though the exact percentage can vary depending on the type of disease and the specific study.

Given this information, while the claim might not be precisely accurate for every type of infectious disease, it is based on sound scientific evidence that handwashing significantly reduces the risk of many infectious diseases.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if recent reports from credible sources indicate that drug seizures have indeed reached the highest levels ever recorded, the claim would be considered true. If the data shows mixed results or only modest increases, it might be considered mostly true or half true. If the data shows no significant increase or a decrease, the claim would be mostly false or false.

Une partie de la presse sénégalaise a assimilé les arriérés de paiement à la dette intérieure.,false,fr,'A section of the Senegalese press has equated payment arrears with domestic debt.',"The claim that ""a section of the Senegalese press has equated payment arrears with domestic debt"" can be analyzed as follows:

- **Payment arrears** refer to unpaid amounts that are past due. These can include delayed payments for goods, services, wages, or other obligations.
- **Domestic debt** typically refers to the total amount of money owed by a country's government to lenders within the same country.

While there can be some overlap, as payment arrears might contribute to domestic debt, they are not the same concept. Payment arrears are a subset of financial obligations that may or may not be part of a country's domestic debt.

Therefore, equating payment arrears directly with domestic debt is not accurate, as it oversimplifies and misrepresents the financial concepts involved.

The claim states that with R$ 20 billion, 11 million jobs were saved.

1. **Context and Data**: The Emergency Program for Employment and Income Maintenance was implemented to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program aimed to provide financial assistance to businesses to help them retain employees.

2. **Verification**: To verify the claim, we would need to look at official reports, government data, and independent analyses. These sources would provide insights into the actual number of jobs saved and the amount of money spent.

3. **Analysis**: If official data and independent analyses confirm that R$ 20 billion was indeed spent and resulted in saving 11 million jobs, the claim would be true. However, if there are discrepancies in the numbers or the data is not conclusive, the claim may be partially true or false.

Without access to specific data, we can provide a hypothetical assessment:

- **True**: If the data from official sources and independent analyses confirm the numbers.
- **Mostly True**: If the data is generally correct but there are minor discrepancies or uncertainties.
- **Half True**: If there is significant uncertainty or if only part of the claim is supported by data.
- **Mostly False**: If the data significantly contradicts the claim.
- **False**: If the data clearly shows that the claim is incorrect.

Given the context and the need for specific data to make a precise judgment, a reasonable approach would be to consider the claim as partially accurate unless the data overwhelmingly supports or contradicts it.

“[El Gobierno] le subió las retenciones al campo a niveles que había antes”,half true,es,"""[The Government] raised the withholding taxes on agriculture to levels that existed before.""","To accurately assess the claim, we need to verify whether the government did indeed raise the withholding taxes on agriculture to levels that existed before. Without specific context or data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I'll outline the steps you would typically take to verify such a claim:

1. **Identify the Source**: Determine who made the claim and in what context.
2. **Check Official Records**: Look at government reports, tax codes, and legislative records to see if there have been recent changes to withholding taxes on agriculture.
3. **Compare Historical Data**: Compare the current tax rates with those from a previous period to see if they have been raised to the same levels.
4. **Consult Experts**: Talk to tax experts or economists who specialize in agricultural taxation to get their insights.

Given the lack of specific data in this hypothetical scenario, let's assume the following:

- The government recently passed legislation that increased withholding taxes on agricultural income.
- This increase brought the tax rates back to levels that were in place before a previous tax cut.

If these assumptions are correct, the claim would be 'Mostly True'. However, without concrete evidence, we cannot definitively say it is 'True'.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which is a leading intergovernmental organization in the field of migration, the number of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean during 2015 and 2016 is well-documented:

- In 2015, the IOM reported that approximately 3,771 migrants died or went missing in the Mediterranean.
- In 2016, the IOM reported that approximately 5,096 migrants died or went missing in the Mediterranean.

Adding these numbers together gives us a total of approximately 8,867 migrant deaths or missing persons in the Mediterranean between 2015 and 2016.

Therefore, the claim that ""More than 6,500 migrants died in the Mediterranean between 2015 and 2016"" is supported by the data provided by the IOM.

Without specific data, we can't definitively confirm the exact percentages. However, the claim suggests a significant discrepancy between what the City contributes and what it receives. If the City indeed generates almost 25% of the resources but receives only just over 1% of the funds, this would indicate a substantial imbalance.

Given the information provided, the claim appears plausible but lacks specific data to be fully verified. Therefore, it is reasonable to categorize it as 'Mostly True' based on the assumption that the figures are approximately correct.

“El salario docente está $4.000 por debajo de la línea de pobreza para el maestro de grado”,half true,es,"""The teacher's salary is $4,000 below the poverty line for the primary school teacher.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Poverty Line Definition**: The poverty line varies by region and family size. For the sake of this evaluation, let's assume we are using a standard definition for a single individual or a typical family size relevant to the context.

2. **Teacher's Salary**: We need to know the actual salary of the primary school teacher in question.

Without specific data on the poverty line and the teacher's salary, we cannot conclusively determine the truth of the claim. However, we can reason based on typical scenarios:

- If the poverty line for a single individual is, for example, $25,000 annually, and the teacher's salary is $19,000, then the claim would be true.
- If the poverty line is $25,000 and the teacher's salary is $22,000, the claim would be false because the salary is not $4,000 below the poverty line.

Given the lack of specific data, a general evaluation would lean towards considering the claim as potentially exaggerated or inaccurate without concrete evidence.

Without additional context or specific data, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim. However, if we consider overall mortality rates or specific causes of death, it is unlikely that any single country has the fewest deaths in the world, as death rates are influenced by population size, age distribution, and other demographic factors.

1. **General Trends**: There has been a global trend towards more sustainable and efficient cooking fuels, such as electricity and gas, due to environmental and health concerns.
2. **Economic and Environmental Factors**: In some regions, particularly in developing countries, economic hardships or lack of access to modern energy sources might lead families to revert to traditional fuels like firewood.
3. **Specific Reports**: While there are reports of families returning to firewood due to economic crises or lack of access to other fuels, the specific number of ""more than 1 million families"" would need to be substantiated by reliable sources.

For example, the 2020 census data from the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC) of Argentina, along with reports from local NGOs and government agencies, suggest that a substantial number of people face severe housing issues, including overcrowding, poor living conditions, and homelessness.

El aumento de Ciencia y Tecnología [será] de 28%,false,es,The increase in Science and Technology will be 28%.,"To evaluate the claim ""The increase in Science and Technology will be 28%,"" we need more context and specific data to determine its accuracy. Without additional information on the time frame, the baseline from which the increase is measured, and the source of the data, it is impossible to definitively classify the claim.

However, given the lack of context and specific details, the claim cannot be verified as true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

Nós temos 40% da população carcerária de presos provisórios,true,pt,We have 40% of the prison population made up of pretrial detainees.,"To evaluate the claim that ""40% of the prison population is made up of pretrial detainees,"" we need reliable and current data. As of my last update in October 2023, various sources indicate that while the exact percentage can vary by country and over time, the global average is often cited to be around 30% to 35%. However, in some countries, this percentage can be higher.

Given that the claim states a specific figure of 40%, which is higher than the commonly cited global average but not entirely implausible for certain regions, it's reasonable to consider this claim as 'Mostly True' if we take into account that it could be accurate for specific contexts or regions.

Les découvertes de gaz au Sénégal placent le Sénégal au 27e rang mondial et au 5e en Afrique en matière de réserves.,half true,fr,The gas discoveries in Senegal place Senegal at the 27th rank worldwide and the 5th in Africa in terms of reserves.,"To evaluate the claim about Senegal's gas reserves ranking, we need to consider the most recent and reliable data on global and African gas reserves. As of my last update in October 2023, the specific ranking of Senegal's gas reserves globally and within Africa may not be readily available without consulting the latest reports from authoritative sources such as the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), BP Statistical Review of World Energy, or other reputable energy industry publications.

Given the dynamic nature of gas discoveries and the continuous updating of reserve estimates, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim without current data. However, Senegal has indeed seen significant gas discoveries in recent years, which have boosted its reserves and potentially its ranking.

Without precise and up-to-date figures, a general assessment would be that Senegal's gas reserves have grown substantially, but whether they place the country at the 27th rank worldwide and the 5th in Africa requires verification from the latest sources.

La balance commerciale est déficitaire de 2.000 milliards de FCFA avec 3.500 milliards de FCFA d’importations contre 1.500 milliards de FCFA d’exportations,half true,fr,"The trade balance is in deficit by 2,000 billion CFA francs with 3,500 billion CFA francs of imports against 1,500 billion CFA francs of exports.","To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to calculate the trade balance using the provided figures for imports and exports.

The trade balance is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Trade Balance} = \text{Exports} - \text{Imports} \]

Given:
- Imports = 3,500 billion CFA francs
- Exports = 1,500 billion CFA francs

\[ \text{Trade Balance} = 1,500 \text{ billion CFA francs} - 3,500 \text{ billion CFA francs} \]
\[ \text{Trade Balance} = -2,000 \text{ billion CFA francs} \]

The trade balance is indeed in deficit by 2,000 billion CFA francs, as stated in the claim.

"“La velocidad promedio de Internet en 2015 era apenas de 4,5 megabits por segundo, hoy la triplicamos”",mostly true,es,"""The average Internet speed in 2015 was only 4.5 megabits per second, today we have tripled it.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the average Internet speed in 2015 and the current average Internet speed. According to various sources, the average global Internet speed in 2015 was around 5 megabits per second (Mbps). As of recent data, the average global Internet speed has indeed increased significantly, but it is important to verify the exact figures to determine if it has tripled.

If the current average speed is around 15 Mbps or higher, the claim would be considered mostly true. However, if the current speed is lower than 13.5 Mbps (three times 4.5 Mbps), the claim would be less accurate.

Given that the actual current average speed is likely to be higher than 15 Mbps based on recent reports, the claim is mostly true but not entirely precise.

“Se fugaron casi un PBI”,false,es,"""They fled with almost a GDP.""","The claim ""They fled with almost a GDP"" implies that a group of individuals left with an amount of money close to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country. The GDP of a country typically represents the total value of goods and services produced within that country over a specific period, usually a year.

Given the enormous scale of a country's GDP, it is highly improbable that any group could flee with an amount of money even close to this figure. For example, the GDP of even a small country is in the billions or trillions of dollars, making it practically impossible for individuals to escape with such a vast sum.

Therefore, the claim is not credible and should be considered false.

"“En 2002 hubo leyes que prohibían despidos y eso no trajo más trabajo, destruyó trabajo”",false,es,"""In 2002 there were laws that prohibited layoffs and that did not bring more jobs, it destroyed jobs.""","The claim ""In 2002 there were laws that prohibited layoffs and that did not bring more jobs, it destroyed jobs"" is a general statement that requires context and specific details to evaluate accurately. However, it is known that certain countries, such as France and Italy, have implemented laws aimed at restricting layoffs to protect workers' rights. These laws can have complex economic effects, sometimes leading to unintended consequences such as reduced job creation or increased use of temporary contracts.

While it is true that such laws can have negative impacts on job creation, the overall effect can vary widely depending on the specific implementation and other economic factors. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but oversimplifies the issue.

"Senza la Lombardia, l’Italia è (quasi) come Germania e Danimarca",mostly true,it,"'Without Lombardy, Italy is (almost) like Germany and Denmark'.","To evaluate the claim ""Without Lombardy, Italy is (almost) like Germany and Denmark,"" we need to consider several factors such as geography, economy, culture, and demographics.

1. **Geography**: Lombardy is a significant region in Italy, both in terms of size and population. Without Lombardy, Italy would still have diverse geographical features, but it would lose a major economic and cultural hub.

2. **Economy**: Lombardy is one of the most economically productive regions in Italy. Removing it would significantly impact Italy's overall economy. Germany and Denmark are known for their strong economies, but the comparison is complex because Italy's economic landscape varies greatly by region.

3. **Culture**: Italy has a rich and diverse cultural heritage, which is significantly influenced by Lombardy. Removing Lombardy would alter Italy's cultural identity, but it would not necessarily make Italy culturally similar to Germany or Denmark.

4. **Demographics**: Lombardy has a large population, and its removal would reduce Italy's overall population. However, the demographic profiles of Germany and Denmark are different from Italy, even without Lombardy.

Given these points, the claim that ""Without Lombardy, Italy is (almost) like Germany and Denmark"" is a significant oversimplification. While there might be some economic similarities, the cultural, geographical, and demographic differences are substantial.

“La Argentina está a punto de emitir la mayor deuda [en moneda extranjera] de un país en desarrollo desde 1996”,true,es,"""Argentina is about to issue the largest foreign currency debt of a developing country since 1996.""","The claim that ""Argentina is about to issue the largest foreign currency debt of a developing country since 1996"" requires contextual information to be accurately evaluated, particularly the year when the claim was made and the specific details of the debt issuance. However, based on historical records, Argentina has indeed issued significant amounts of foreign currency debt, including a notable issuance in 2016 which was one of the largest by a developing country.

Given this context, while the claim might not be entirely precise without additional details, it is largely accurate in reflecting a significant financial event. Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly true.

According to various sources, including the World Bank and other international organizations, Guinea's access to electricity has been limited but is generally higher than the 5-10% range suggested in the claim. As of recent data, Guinea's electrification rate is estimated to be around 30-40% in urban areas and significantly lower in rural areas, but overall, it is higher than 10%.

Given this information, the claim that Guinea has not managed to achieve even 5 or 10% access to electricity is inaccurate.

While it is true that the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is not routinely given to the general population in the United States, it is used in specific cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the BCG vaccine for certain individuals, such as healthcare workers and children who are at high risk of exposure to tuberculosis. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true.

Le numérique génère 8% du PIB de la Côte d'Ivoire et 13% des recettes fiscales de ce pays.,mostly true,fr,'Digital technology generates 8% of Côte d'Ivoire's GDP and 13% of this country's tax revenues.',"To accurately assess the claim, we need reliable and recent data specific to Côte d'Ivoire's digital technology sector. However, without access to real-time databases or specific reports, we can make an educated guess based on general trends and available information.

Given the increasing importance of digital technology globally and the efforts many countries, including Côte d'Ivoire, are making to boost their digital economies, it is plausible that digital technology contributes significantly to GDP and tax revenues. However, the exact percentages (8% of GDP and 13% of tax revenues) require verification from official sources such as government reports, economic surveys, or international development organizations.

Without specific data to confirm these figures, the claim cannot be fully validated or refuted. Therefore, the most cautious assessment would be:

According to recent data from these sources, the unemployment rate in Ivory Coast is significantly lower than the range mentioned in the claim. As of the latest available data, the unemployment rate in Ivory Coast is typically reported to be around 5-10%, which is much lower than 70-90%.

Given this discrepancy, the claim is inaccurate.

“Cada tres minutos una familia recibe un crédito hipotecario a 30 años del Banco Nación”,half true,es,"""Every three minutes, a family receives a 30-year mortgage loan from Banco Nación.""","To evaluate the claim that ""Every three minutes, a family receives a 30-year mortgage loan from Banco Nación,"" we need to consider the context and the data available.

1. **Context**: The claim suggests a high frequency of mortgage approvals, specifically one every three minutes.
2. **Data Verification**: This claim would require statistical data from Banco Nación regarding the number of 30-year mortgage loans approved per day, week, or month.
3. **Feasibility**: To verify, we would calculate the number of approvals per day (24 hours * 60 minutes / 3 minutes per approval = 480 approvals per day). We would then compare this with actual data from Banco Nación.

Without specific data from Banco Nación, it is challenging to definitively conclude the accuracy of the claim. However, based on typical banking operations and the complexity of mortgage approvals, this claim seems highly optimistic but not necessarily impossible.

**Final Answer: Mostly True**. This is a cautious assessment pending actual data from Banco Nación.",mostly true,False,False
"Le déficit budgétaire est passé de 6,7 % en 2011 à 3,7 % en 2019.",mostly true,fr,The budget deficit decreased from 6.7% in 2011 to 3.7% in 2019.,"To evaluate the claim that ""The budget deficit decreased from 6.7% in 2011 to 3.7% in 2019,"" we need to verify the accuracy of the given percentages for the budget deficit in those years.

According to publicly available data from sources like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP in the United States was approximately 8.4% in 2011 and 4.6% in 2019.

Given this information, the claim that the budget deficit decreased from 6.7% in 2011 to 3.7% in 2019 is not entirely accurate. The actual figures are different, but the general trend of a decrease is correct. Therefore, the claim is mostly true but not entirely accurate.

COVID-19 (...) 5 months"".","The claim that the development time for the typhoid fever vaccine was 105 years and for the COVID-19 vaccine was 5 months is not entirely accurate.

The first typhoid vaccine was developed by Almroth Edward Wright, Richard Pfeiffer, and Wilhelm Kolle in 1896, which is much less than 105 years after the identification of the disease.

For COVID-19, while it is true that vaccines were developed and authorized for emergency use in about 9-12 months, the 5-month timeline is an underestimation. The first COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized for emergency use was the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was developed in around 10 months.

Therefore, the claim is not accurate in both cases.

“No se hicieron nunca en la historia de la Ciudad inversiones en infraestructura escolar como en nuestra gestión”,half true,es,"""Never in the history of the City have there been investments in school infrastructure like there have been during our administration.""","To evaluate the claim accurately, we need to consider the context and available data on school infrastructure investments during the administration in question compared to previous administrations. Without specific data, we can analyze the claim based on typical patterns of public statements and investments.

1. **Historical Context**: Assess whether previous administrations have made similar or larger investments in school infrastructure.
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the scale of investments during the current administration with historical data.
3. **Verification**: Review any available reports, budget allocations, or independent analyses that support or refute the claim.

Given the strong language (""Never in the history""), the claim suggests an unprecedented level of investment. This would require substantial evidence to support.

**Final Answer: Mostly True.**

This assumes that while the investments are significant and likely among the highest, it's challenging to definitively say ""never"" without comprehensive historical data.",mostly true,False,False

The claim states that a report by the TCU (Tribunal de Contas da União, the Brazilian Court of Audit) found a 33% increase in monthly consultations in primary care in 1,837 municipalities due to the arrival of doctors.

Without additional context or verification from the original TCU report, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the 33% figure. However, if the claim is based on a reputable source like the TCU and there is no evidence contradicting it, it is reasonable to assume it is mostly accurate.

According to various economic reports and data from institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Africa did experience significant economic growth in the years leading up to 2015. From around 2000 to 2015, many African countries saw sustained economic growth rates averaging close to 5%. This period is often referred to as a time of robust economic performance for the continent.

While the growth rates did vary among different countries and regions within Africa, the overall trend aligns with the claim that Africa's GDP had been growing by nearly 5% for 15 years.

Therefore, the statement is mostly accurate, reflecting the general economic trend in Africa during that period.

While it is true that detecting a lump during a self-exam may indicate that the cancer has progressed to a certain stage, it does not necessarily mean that it is ""too late"" for treatment. Early detection, including through self-exams, can still significantly improve the chances of successful treatment and survival. Therefore, the claim is an oversimplification and could be misleading.

Elle détient la moitié des réserves mondiales de ce minerai, a dit son président Alpha Condé.",half true,fr,"'Guinea is becoming the world's leading producer of bauxite. It holds half of the world's reserves of this mineral, said its president Alpha Condé.'","To evaluate the claim that ""Guinea is becoming the world's leading producer of bauxite"" and that it holds ""half of the world's reserves of this mineral,"" we need to consider recent data on bauxite production and reserves.

1. **Bauxite Production:**
   - Guinea has indeed been increasing its bauxite production significantly in recent years. According to various reports, Guinea is one of the top producers of bauxite globally, competing with countries like Australia and China.

2. **Bauxite Reserves:**
   - Guinea does possess substantial bauxite reserves. According to the U.S. Geological Survey and other sources, Guinea is estimated to hold about 7.4 billion metric tons of bauxite reserves, which is indeed a significant portion of the world's total reserves.

However, the claim that Guinea holds ""half of the world's reserves"" is an overstatement. While Guinea does have a large share, it does not account for half of the global reserves. The total global reserves are much higher, and other countries like Australia also have substantial reserves.

**Conclusion:**
The claim that Guinea is becoming the world's leading producer of bauxite has some truth, as Guinea is a major player in bauxite production. However, the claim that it holds half of the world's reserves is inaccurate.

"“La inflación en 80 años ha sido, en promedio, 62,5% sin contar los años de hiperinflación”",half true,es,"""The inflation over 80 years has been, on average, 62.5% without counting the years of hyperinflation.""","To evaluate the claim that ""The inflation over 80 years has been, on average, 62.5% without counting the years of hyperinflation,"" we need to consider historical inflation data and the methodology used to calculate the average.

1. **Historical Inflation Data**: Inflation rates vary significantly over time and across different countries. Without specifying the country or the exact time period, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the 62.5% average.

2. **Methodology**: The claim mentions excluding years of hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is typically defined as inflation exceeding 50% per month. Excluding these periods could significantly alter the average inflation rate.

3. **Average Calculation**: Calculating an average inflation rate over 80 years involves summing the annual inflation rates and dividing by the number of years. However, this method does not account for the compounding effect of inflation, which is more accurately represented by the geometric mean.

Given these considerations, the claim lacks sufficient context and specificity to be definitively verified. The use of a simple arithmetic average for inflation rates over an extended period is also methodologically questionable.

Paragone sbaglia sulla crescita dell’Eurozona,false,it,'Paragone is wrong about the growth of the Eurozone'.,"To evaluate the claim ""Paragone is wrong about the growth of the Eurozone,"" we need specific details about what Paragone has said about the Eurozone's growth and the actual data on the Eurozone's growth. Without these details, it's impossible to accurately assess the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to how one might evaluate such a statement.

1. **Identify Paragone's Claim**: Determine what Paragone has said about the Eurozone's growth.
2. **Gather Data**: Look at official economic data from reliable sources such as Eurostat, the European Central Bank, or other economic research institutions.
3. **Compare Claim with Data**: Analyze whether the data supports or contradicts Paragone's claim.

If Paragone has made a specific claim about the Eurozone's growth that is not supported by the data, the statement ""Paragone is wrong about the growth of the Eurozone"" would be true. Conversely, if the data aligns with Paragone's claim, the statement would be false.

Given the lack of specific information in the prompt, I'll have to assume a hypothetical scenario where Paragone's claim is not aligned with the data:

Il salario minimo italiano sarebbe il più generoso tra i Paesi Ocse?,half true,it,'Is the Italian minimum wage the most generous among OECD countries?',"As of my last update, Italy does not have a legally mandated national minimum wage. Instead, minimum wages are typically set through collective bargaining agreements by trade unions and employers' associations. This means that Italy does not have a single minimum wage rate that can be compared directly with other OECD countries that have statutory minimum wages.

Given this context, the claim that the Italian minimum wage is the most generous among OECD countries is misleading because Italy does not have a statutory minimum wage. Therefore, the claim cannot be accurately evaluated in comparison to countries with established minimum wage laws.

Calenda ha ragione su crescita dell'export e dell'occupazione al Sud,mostly true,it,Calenda is right about the growth of exports and employment in the South.,"To evaluate the claim ""Calenda is right about the growth of exports and employment in the South,"" we need to consider the context and data related to exports and employment in the South of Italy. Without specific data or context, I'll provide a general assessment based on typical economic analyses:

1. **Exports**: Historically, the South of Italy has faced economic challenges, including lower levels of exports compared to the North. However, there have been efforts and some successes in improving the export sector in the South.

2. **Employment**: The South of Italy has traditionally had higher unemployment rates compared to the North. However, there have been initiatives aimed at boosting employment, with varying degrees of success.

Given these points, the claim could be considered partially true, as there might be some growth in exports and employment, but it is likely not as robust as in other regions of Italy.

Without specific numerical data, we can't definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume we have the following hypothetical data:

- Deficit of Aerolíneas: $5 billion
- Budget of the Ministry of Industry: $1 billion

In this hypothetical scenario, the deficit of Aerolíneas is indeed five times more than the entire budget of the Ministry of Industry, making the claim true.

However, without actual data, we can't provide a real-world assessment. If the actual numbers were different, the claim could be false or fall into one of the other categories.

Without access to detailed economic reports or trade statistics, it is challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim.

However, considering the general trends in global trade and France's historical economic ties with Senegal, it is plausible that there could have been shifts in market share due to various factors such as increased competition from other countries, changes in trade policies, or economic developments in Senegal.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm the exact percentage decrease, the claim cannot be definitively labeled as 'True' or 'False.' It is more appropriate to categorize it as 'Half True' or 'Mostly True' if there is some evidence of a decline, even if not exactly 25%.

“La reducción de las salideras bancarias está en el orden del 80%”,mostly true,es,"""The reduction in bank withdrawals is around 80%.""","To evaluate the claim ""The reduction in bank withdrawals is around 80%,"" we need to consider the context and available data. Without specific data or context provided in the prompt, it's impossible to definitively say whether this claim is true. However, we can assess the plausibility based on general financial trends and typical banking behaviors.

In times of economic uncertainty or increased digital banking usage, a significant reduction in physical bank withdrawals can occur. However, an 80% reduction is quite substantial and would typically require specific economic conditions or policy changes to support such a claim.

Given the lack of specific data and context, we can't confirm the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, a reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"A polícia, durante a intervenção, mata seis pessoas por dia",half true,pt,"'The police, during the intervention, kill six people per day'.","To evaluate the claim ""The police, during the intervention, kill six people per day,"" we need reliable data on police-related fatalities. As of my last update in October 2023, reliable sources such as the Washington Post's database on police shootings indicate that the number of people killed by police in the United States averages around three per day. This is significantly lower than the six per day claimed.

Given this discrepancy, the claim that the police kill six people per day is not accurate based on available data.

A revelação é inspiradora: J. K. Rowling saiu da lista dos mais ricos......,mostly true,pt,The revelation is inspiring: J. K. Rowling has fallen off the list of the wealthiest......,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""J. K. Rowling has fallen off the list of the wealthiest,"" we would need to refer to recent and reliable sources that track the wealth of prominent individuals, such as Forbes or Bloomberg. Without specific data from these sources, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, as of my last update in October 2023, there has been no widely reported or confirmed information that J. K. Rowling has fallen off the list of the wealthiest individuals. J. K. Rowling has consistently been among the wealthiest authors due to the enduring success of the Harry Potter franchise and her ongoing literary and creative ventures.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to support the claim and her historical status as one of the wealthiest authors, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is likely 'False' or 'Mostly False' without specific data to the contrary.

La Côte d'Ivoire figure parmi les 20 pays qui ont les systèmes de santé les moins performants au monde.,true,fr,'Côte d'Ivoire is among the 20 countries with the least efficient healthcare systems in the world.',"To evaluate the claim that ""Côte d'Ivoire is among the 20 countries with the least efficient healthcare systems in the world,"" we need to consider various metrics and reports that assess healthcare efficiency globally. However, without access to real-time data or specific rankings, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

That said, Côte d'Ivoire has faced significant challenges in its healthcare system, including limited infrastructure, a shortage of healthcare professionals, and unequal access to healthcare services. These factors contribute to lower healthcare efficiency compared to many other countries.

Given the known challenges in Côte d'Ivoire's healthcare system, it is plausible that it could rank among the countries with less efficient healthcare systems. However, without specific data to confirm its exact ranking, a cautious approach would be to label this claim as ""Mostly True.""

This analysis would require detailed knowledge of the political context, the agreements made between the parties, and Renzi's public statements.

Without specific examples and context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general political dynamics, it is common for politicians to have differing interpretations of concessions and agreements. Therefore, without concrete evidence, a balanced assessment might be:

“Sembramos el mismo trigo que hace 100 años”,true,es,"""We sow the same wheat as we did 100 years ago.""","The claim ""We sow the same wheat as we did 100 years ago"" is not entirely accurate. While some heritage varieties of wheat are still cultivated, modern agriculture predominantly uses varieties that have been significantly modified through selective breeding and, in some cases, genetic engineering to improve yield, disease resistance, and other desirable traits. Therefore, the wheat we sow today is generally different from what was sown 100 years ago.

Without specific data or context, it's impossible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume we have access to reliable data that indicates the budget execution rate.

If the data shows that the budget has indeed been executed by around 12%, then the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows a slightly different percentage but still close to 12%, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the execution rate is significantly different but still somewhat aligned with the claim, it could be 'Half True'. If the data shows a much higher or lower execution rate, it would be 'Mostly False'. If the data contradicts the claim entirely, it would be 'False'.

Final Answer: Without specific data, we cannot provide a definitive answer. If data were available, the response would be based on the actual budget execution rate.",,False,True
Una Lilliput? Quanto “pesano” i Paesi Bassi nell’Unione europea,mostly true,it,'A Lilliput? How much do the Netherlands “weigh” in the European Union'.,"To evaluate the claim that the Netherlands is a ""Lilliput"" in the European Union (EU), we need to consider various factors such as population, economic power, and political influence.

1. **Population**: The Netherlands has a population of approximately 17.5 million, which is relatively small compared to larger EU countries like Germany and France. However, it is not among the smallest countries in the EU.

2. **Economic Power**: The Netherlands has one of the strongest economies in the EU. It is often ranked among the top economies in terms of GDP per capita and has a significant presence in global trade and finance.

3. **Political Influence**: The Netherlands is a founding member of the EU and has played a significant role in shaping its policies. It is known for its active engagement in EU affairs and its influence in various EU institutions.

Given these factors, while the Netherlands may be smaller in terms of population, its economic power and political influence make it a significant player in the EU. Therefore, labeling the Netherlands as a ""Lilliput"" is not accurate.

Explanation: The statement suggests a specific sequence of events (first Twitter, then Facebook) and a rapid spread. Without additional context or evidence, it's impossible to verify the exact sequence and the speed of spread. Thus, while it might be true that a photograph emerged on both platforms, the specific details make the claim only half true.",half true,False,False
"Le taux de chômage est de 18,8 % au Nigeria, selon le Spectator Index. Des personnes ont émis des doutes via Tweeter.",true,fr,"'The unemployment rate is 18.8% in Nigeria, according to the Spectator Index. People have expressed doubts via Twitter.'","To determine the veracity of the claim that ""The unemployment rate is 18.8% in Nigeria, according to the Spectator Index,"" we need to verify the source and compare it with other reliable data sources.

The Spectator Index is known for sharing statistical data, but it is essential to cross-check this information with official government statistics or reports from international organizations like the World Bank or the International Labour Organization (ILO).

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the most recent reliable data on Nigeria's unemployment rate would typically come from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of Nigeria. According to NBS reports, the unemployment rate in Nigeria has been quite high but may not match exactly with the figure provided by the Spectator Index.

Given the potential for slight variations or updates in the data, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' if the Spectator Index's figure is reasonably close to the official NBS data. However, without the exact NBS figure for comparison, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
L’actuel gouvernement du Nigeria a contracté une dette de 80 milliards de dollars.,mostly true,fr,The current government of Nigeria has incurred a debt of $80 billion.,"To evaluate the claim that ""The current government of Nigeria has incurred a debt of $80 billion,"" we need to consider the most recent and reliable data available on Nigeria's national debt.

As of the latest available data from reputable sources such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank, Nigeria's external debt is typically reported in the range of tens of billions of dollars, but the exact figure can vary.

Given that the claim specifies a precise figure of $80 billion, we need to verify this against the most recent official reports. As of my last update, the reported external debt of Nigeria was around $37 billion in 2021, according to the Debt Management Office of Nigeria. However, this figure can change, and additional internal debt should also be considered.

Without the most up-to-date figures, it's challenging to definitively confirm or deny the $80 billion claim. However, based on historical trends and available data, a debt figure of $80 billion seems higher than typically reported.

Therefore, based on the information available, the claim is likely exaggerated but might contain some truth if considering both external and internal debt.

Therefore, salary and profit are distinct concepts.

Referendums can vary widely by country and context, and not all referendums involve decisions on the purchase of weapons and ammunition. To provide a definitive answer, more information is needed, such as the country, the exact wording of the referendum question, and the official results.

Given the lack of specific information, the claim cannot be accurately judged as true or false.

“Este año logramos bajar los cortes [de luz] 45%”,true,es,"""This year we managed to reduce the power cuts by 45%"".","To evaluate the claim ""This year we managed to reduce the power cuts by 45%,"" we need to consider the context and the available data. Without specific data or additional context, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, we can provide a framework for how the claim might be evaluated:

1. **True**: The claim is supported by reliable, verifiable data showing a 45% reduction in power cuts.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim is largely accurate but may have minor inaccuracies or lacks some context.
3. **Half True**: The claim contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate information or lacks significant context.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim has some elements of truth but is largely inaccurate or misleading.
5. **False**: The claim is not supported by any reliable data and is misleading or false.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, we cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, for the sake of example, if we assume the claim is based on credible data showing a significant reduction but not exactly 45%, it might be categorized as:

For example, according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, black women experience intimate partner violence at rates higher than white women. However, the statement could be misleading if it implies that black women are the only or primary group affected by violence against women. Therefore, the claim is 'Mostly True'.

Without specific data and context, it is challenging to definitively classify the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is being made with some supporting evidence, such as recent recruitment numbers that exceed previous records, it might be considered 'Mostly True' or 'Half True' depending on the comparative data available. If the claim lacks substantial evidence or is significantly exaggerated, it might lean towards 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Given the lack of specific data provided in the claim, a cautious assessment would be:

If we look at today, we are not satisfied because we have 46-47%.","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the historical and current data on female literacy rates.

Firstly, the claim states that in 1960, only 3% of women were literate. According to historical data from sources like UNESCO, literacy rates for women were indeed very low in many regions during that time, though the exact figure can vary by country. However, 3% is a plausible figure for some regions with very low literacy rates at that time.

Secondly, the claim mentions that today, the literacy rate for women is around 46-47%. According to recent data from UNESCO and other international organizations, the global literacy rate for women is indeed significantly higher than in 1960, though the exact figures can vary. For many countries, the literacy rate for women is indeed around this range, though it can be higher in some developed countries and lower in some developing countries.

Given these considerations, the claim appears to be generally accurate, though it may not be precise for all regions or countries. Therefore, the most fitting categorization would be 'Mostly True'.

"No, non possiamo accusare il governo di togliere alla scuola per dare ai pensionati",false,it,"'No, we cannot accuse the government of taking from schools to give to pensioners'.","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and evidence related to government spending on schools and pensions. Without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, generally speaking, governments often have to manage budgets that cover a wide range of services, including education and pensions. Changes in funding for one area may or may not directly impact another area, depending on the specific policies and economic circumstances.

Given the lack of specific data or context in the claim, a general assessment could be that it is not entirely accurate to say that the government is taking from schools to give to pensioners, as budget allocations are typically more complex and multifaceted.

L’Italia rischia di perdere oltre 60 milioni di turisti stranieri,true,it,Italy risks losing more than 60 million foreign tourists.,"To evaluate the claim ""Italy risks losing more than 60 million foreign tourists,"" we need to consider the context, data sources, and any supporting evidence. Given that specific data and context are not provided in the claim, it is challenging to definitively classify it without further information. However, it is plausible that such a claim could be made based on various factors such as economic downturns, travel restrictions, or other significant events affecting tourism.

Without specific data to verify the exact number of tourists potentially lost, the claim can be considered somewhat speculative but not entirely baseless. Therefore, a balanced assessment would be that the claim is somewhat plausible but lacks concrete evidence to be fully verified.

Without specific data, we can analyze the general economic trends and context.

1. **Growth of Credit:** Generally, credit (loans and other forms of borrowing) tends to grow as economies expand. This is because businesses and individuals borrow more to invest and consume.

2. **Economic Context:** The period from 2003 to 2013 saw significant economic events, including the global financial crisis of 2008, which could have affected credit markets and GDP.

3. **Empirical Evidence:** To accurately assess the claim, we would need empirical data on the ratio of credit to GDP for the years 2003 and 2013. Such data could come from sources like the World Bank, IMF, or national statistical agencies.

Given the lack of specific data in this response, we cannot definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, the claim that credit doubled its share in GDP over a decade is plausible considering the economic context and general trends.

Without access to real-time data or specific reports, I can provide a general approach to how one might assess this claim:

1. **Check Official Crime Reports**: Look at official crime statistics from local law enforcement agencies or government reports. Compare recent years to identify any trends.
2. **Review Media Reports**: Analyze news articles and media reports that discuss crime rates in Buenos Aires.
3. **Consult Expert Analysis**: Consider statements from criminologists, sociologists, or other experts who may have studied crime trends in the region.

The claim states that the education provided by the city hall of Aracaju ranked last in the early years of elementary school and third to last in the later years, according to recent Ideb data. To verify this, we would typically need to consult the most recent Ideb reports to see the rankings of Aracaju in the early and later years of elementary school.

Without direct access to the specific Ideb data mentioned, we can't definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if the statement accurately reflects the data presented in the Ideb reports, it would be considered true. If there are minor discrepancies or inaccuracies, it might be classified as mostly true. If the data is significantly misrepresented, it could be mostly false or false.

Given the information provided, we can't make a definitive judgment without the specific data. Therefore, the most appropriate classification based on the general understanding of how Ideb data is used would be 'Half True', assuming some accuracy but not fully verifiable without the exact data.

“La relación entre los delitos cometidos y las personas condenadas es menor al 1%”,mostly true,es,"""The ratio of crimes committed to persons convicted is less than 1%.""","To evaluate the claim ""The ratio of crimes committed to persons convicted is less than 1%,"" we need to consider the available data on crime reporting, clearance rates, and conviction rates.

1. **Crime Reporting**: Not all crimes are reported to the police. According to various studies, a significant portion of crimes go unreported.

2. **Clearance Rates**: Of the crimes that are reported, not all are solved (cleared) by the police. Clearance rates vary by type of crime but are generally much lower than 100%.

3. **Conviction Rates**: Even when a crime is cleared, not all cases result in a conviction. The legal process can lead to acquittals, dismissals, or plea bargains that do not result in conviction.

Given these factors, the overall ratio of crimes committed to persons convicted is indeed quite low. While exact figures can vary, it is generally accepted that the ratio is much lower than 1%, primarily due to the combined effects of underreporting, low clearance rates, and the challenges of the legal process.

Therefore, the claim is broadly accurate.

“El 44% de los subsidios se lo llevan las dos décimas partes de la población más rica”,half true,es,"""The top 20% of the wealthiest population receives 44% of the subsidies.""","To evaluate the claim ""The top 20% of the wealthiest population receives 44% of the subsidies,"" we would need to consider the context and data source for such a statement. However, without specific data or a source to verify, we can make some general observations.

In many economies, it is not uncommon for wealthier individuals to receive a disproportionate share of subsidies due to various factors, such as the types of subsidies available and the distribution mechanisms. However, the exact percentage can vary widely depending on the country, the type of subsidies, and other economic factors.

Given that the claim does not provide a specific context or data source, we cannot definitively confirm or deny its accuracy. Therefore, the most appropriate evaluation would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
Le chômage est à son plus haut niveau au Nigerai; Plus de 10 millions de jeunes sont sans emploi.,half true,fr,Unemployment is at its highest level in Nigeria; More than 10 million youth are jobless.,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at recent and reliable data on unemployment in Nigeria. As of my last update in October 2023, the most recent data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Nigeria indicates that the unemployment rate is indeed high, but specific figures can vary.

According to the NBS, as of the second quarter of 2020, the unemployment rate in Nigeria was around 27.1%, and the underemployment rate was around 28.6%. This means a significant portion of the population is either unemployed or underemployed.

Regarding the claim that ""More than 10 million youth are jobless,"" this specific figure can be challenging to verify without the most recent and detailed data. However, given the high unemployment rate, it is plausible that a large number of youth are unemployed.

Based on the available information, the claim that unemployment is at its highest level in Nigeria is mostly accurate, considering the high rates reported. The specific figure of ""more than 10 million youth"" being jobless is harder to confirm precisely but aligns with the trend of high unemployment.

As of my last update in October 2023, Kédougou has often been cited as a region with significant health challenges, including higher mortality rates compared to other regions in Senegal. However, specific data on mortality rates can vary, and the most recent data should be consulted for an accurate assessment.

Given the general consensus and available information up to 2023, it is likely that Kédougou does have one of the higher mortality rates in Senegal. However, without the most up-to-date statistics, it is difficult to definitively state that it is the highest.

"Criar uma tarifa diferenciada, em horários alternativos - diminuindo a sobrecarga nos horários de alto fluxo",true,pt,"""To create a differentiated fare during alternative hours - reducing the overload during peak times.""","To evaluate the claim ""To create a differentiated fare during alternative hours - reducing the overload during peak times,"" we need to consider whether differentiated fares can indeed help reduce overload during peak times.

Differentiated fares, also known as peak pricing or surge pricing, are a common strategy used in various industries, including transportation, to manage demand. The idea is that by charging higher fares during peak times and lower fares during off-peak times, you can encourage some users to shift their travel to less busy periods, thereby reducing the overload during peak times.

Studies and real-world applications have shown that this approach can be effective in managing demand and redistributing users across different times. For example, public transit systems and ride-sharing services often use differentiated fares to influence travel patterns.

However, the effectiveness of this strategy can vary depending on several factors, such as the elasticity of demand, the availability of alternatives, and user behavior. While it generally helps in reducing peak-time congestion, it may not completely eliminate the problem.

Given this analysis, the claim is mostly accurate but not absolutely true in all cases.

Temos mais de 63 milhões de brasileiros no SPC,true,pt,'We have more than 63 million Brazilians in the SPC'.,"To evaluate the claim ""We have more than 63 million Brazilians in the SPC,"" we need to consider the context and available data. The SPC (Serviço de Proteção ao Crédito) is a credit protection service in Brazil that lists individuals with debts or credit issues.

As of the latest available data, the number of Brazilians listed in the SPC is typically lower than 63 million. For example, according to data from 2021, the number of individuals with debts registered in the SPC was around 60 million. While this number can fluctuate, it is unlikely to have increased significantly beyond 63 million without substantial evidence.

Given this information, the claim that there are more than 63 million Brazilians in the SPC is likely an exaggeration.

“[El turismo interno] del 2013 al 2015 cayó en tres millones de pasajeros”,true,es,"""From 2013 to 2015, domestic tourism decreased by three million passengers.""","To evaluate the claim that ""From 2013 to 2015, domestic tourism decreased by three million passengers,"" we would need to refer to specific data on domestic tourism during those years. Since I don't have real-time access to external databases or the ability to browse the internet for the latest reports, I can't verify the claim directly.

However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume that we have access to reliable tourism statistics. If those statistics showed that domestic tourism did indeed decrease by approximately three million passengers from 2013 to 2015, the claim would be considered mostly accurate.

If the decrease was significantly more or less than three million, the claim might be considered 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'. If the data showed no decrease or an increase, the claim would be 'False'.

Without specific data, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, for the sake of completing the exercise, let's assume the data supports a decrease close to three million passengers.

Une loi défiscalise les investissements dans le tourisme en Casamance.,mostly true,fr,A law provides tax exemptions for investments in tourism in Casamance.,"To evaluate the claim ""A law provides tax exemptions for investments in tourism in Casamance,"" it is necessary to verify if such a law exists and what specific provisions it includes.

Without specific details or references to the law in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, it is known that various countries, including those in Africa, often offer tax incentives to encourage investment in key sectors such as tourism. Casamance is a region in Senegal, and Senegal has been known to implement policies aimed at boosting tourism, which may include tax exemptions.

Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is likely to be at least partially true. However, without specific verification, it is not possible to state with certainty that it is entirely true.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
Hoje o Brasil está com quase metade da renda per capita do Chile,half true,pt,"Today, Brazil has almost half the per capita income of Chile.","To evaluate the claim that ""Today, Brazil has almost half the per capita income of Chile,"" we need to look at recent data on per capita income for both countries.

As of recent data (typically from sources like the World Bank or International Monetary Fund):

- Chile's per capita income is generally around $15,000 to $17,000 USD.
- Brazil's per capita income is generally around $8,000 to $9,000 USD.

Based on these figures, Brazil's per capita income is roughly half of Chile's, which aligns with the claim. Therefore, the statement can be considered accurate.

“Todos los afiliados del PAMI tienen la mejor cobertura de medicamentos de América”,half true,es,"""All members of PAMI have the best medication coverage in America.""","To evaluate the claim ""All members of PAMI have the best medication coverage in America,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of ""Best"":** The term ""best"" is subjective and can mean different things to different people. It could refer to the breadth of coverage, cost-effectiveness, accessibility, or other factors.

2. **Universal Application:** The claim uses the phrase ""all members,"" which implies that every single member of PAMI receives this ""best"" coverage without exception.

3. **Comparison with Other Plans:** The claim suggests that PAMI's coverage is superior to all other medication coverage plans in America. This is a bold assertion that would require comprehensive data to substantiate.

Without specific data and clear definitions, it is challenging to verify this claim definitively. However, claiming that ""all members"" have the ""best"" coverage suggests an absoluteness that is unlikely to be true across the board.

Given these considerations, the claim is likely an overgeneralization and cannot be substantiated without more specific evidence.

The claim states that the deficit was R$279 billion when they took over the government and R$159 billion in the following year (2017), indicating a decrease.

Without specific data to verify, we can generally assess the trend and figures. If the figures align with official records and show a decrease as stated, the claim would be considered accurate. However, without precise verification, a cautious approach is to consider it ""Mostly True"" if the trend is correct but the exact figures might have slight discrepancies.

“[En Aerolíneas viaja] el 3% de la población”,mostly true,es,"""3% of the population travels on Aerolíneas""","To evaluate the claim that ""3% of the population travels on Aerolíneas,"" we need to consider several factors, including the context, the specific population being referred to, and any available data that supports or refutes this claim.

Without additional context or specific data, it is challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, general knowledge suggests that the percentage of a population that travels by a specific airline can vary greatly depending on the region, the size of the population, and the market share of the airline.

Given the lack of specific data to support the claim, it is not possible to definitively say whether it is true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be 'Half True,' as it acknowledges the possibility that the claim could be accurate in certain contexts but lacks sufficient evidence to confirm its universal truth.

Le Sénégal est le premier africain et le 4ème mondiale en matière de transparence dans les industires extractives.,half true,fr,Senegal is the first in Africa and the 4th in the world in terms of transparency in the extractive industries.,"To evaluate the claim that ""Senegal is the first in Africa and the 4th in the world in terms of transparency in the extractive industries,"" we need to consider sources that provide rankings on transparency in the extractive industries. One such source is the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is a global standard for the good governance of oil, gas, and mineral resources.

According to the EITI, as of recent reports, Senegal has indeed made significant progress in transparency and is recognized as a leader in Africa in this regard. However, the specific ranking of being ""1st in Africa and 4th in the world"" would require verification from the most current and authoritative sources.

Given the information available, Senegal is highly regarded for its transparency efforts in the extractive industries, but the exact global ranking can vary and should be confirmed with the latest EITI or similar reports.

1. The minimum wage will be $2800.
2. Workers earning $1700 are considered employed.

To evaluate this claim, we need to consider both parts.

1. **Minimum Wage**: The claim that the minimum wage will be $2800 is a specific assertion that can be verified against current minimum wage standards. As of my last update, no country has a minimum wage of $2800 per month.

2. **Employment Definition**: The claim that workers earning $1700 are considered employed is also specific. Generally, the definition of employment does not hinge on a specific wage threshold but rather on the nature of work and the employment relationship.

Without specific context or data to back up these claims, they appear to be unfounded. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

In 2016, the United Nations Human Rights Committee issued a statement regarding the case of former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The committee expressed concerns about the impartiality of the judges and the lack of sufficient evidence in the case against Lula. However, the UN did not explicitly state that Lula's plea was ""legitimate"" due to the ""weakness of the accusation against him."" Instead, the committee requested that Brazil allow Lula to exercise his political rights while his appeals were pending.

Given this context, the claim that the UN stated Lula's plea was legitimate due to the weakness of the accusation against him is a misinterpretation of the UN's statement. The UN expressed concerns but did not make such a definitive statement about the legitimacy of the plea based on the weakness of the accusation.

1. **Brumadinho Dam Collapse (2019):**
   - IBAMA imposed a fine of R$ 250 million on Vale for the environmental damages caused by the dam collapse in Brumadinho.

2. **Mariana Dam Collapse (2015):**
   - After the Mariana dam collapse, Vale (along with BHP Billiton) was also fined by IBAMA, but the initial fines were not as high as R$ 250 million. The total fines imposed on Vale and BHP Billiton for the Mariana disaster were significant but were not a single fine of R$ 250 million.

Given this information, the claim that ""Ibama imposed a fine of R$ 250 million on Vale, unlike what happened, for example, in Mariana"" is not entirely accurate because fines were also imposed after the Mariana disaster, albeit not in the same amount or manner.

La Côte d'Ivoire est l'un des 20 pays pauvres ou émergents qui dépensenet le moins pour la santé des populations.,mostly true,fr,'Ivory Coast is one of the 20 poor or emerging countries that spends the least on the health of its populations.',"To evaluate the claim that ""Ivory Coast is one of the 20 poor or emerging countries that spends the least on the health of its populations,"" we need to consider available data on health expenditures in different countries. While specific ranking data might not be readily available in this context, we can look at general trends and known information about health spending in Ivory Coast compared to other countries.

As of the latest available data, Ivory Coast does have significant health expenditure challenges, with limited resources allocated to healthcare relative to other sectors. However, without specific ranking data that directly compares Ivory Coast to the 20 countries with the lowest health expenditures, it is difficult to definitively say whether it falls into that category.

Given the lack of precise ranking data in this context, it is reasonable to conclude that while Ivory Coast may have relatively low health expenditures, the claim that it is specifically among the 20 poorest or emerging countries with the least health spending cannot be fully verified or refuted without more detailed information.

According to data from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and various judicial monitoring organizations, the vacancy rate in the federal judiciary does fluctuate, but it generally does not reach as high as 30%. The vacancy rate typically ranges between 5% to 15%, with occasional spikes that can approach 20% during periods of significant turnover or delays in the confirmation process.

Given this information, the claim that vacancies fluctuate around 30% is an overstatement.

3. **Retained Functions**: The claim mentions that essential functions such as territorial planning, roads, school buildings, and public and private transportation have remained. This part of the claim can be more easily verified if there is evidence that these functions are still being performed by the provinces.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact numbers of personnel and resource reduction, but acknowledging that essential functions are likely still being performed, the claim can be considered partially true.

Without access to these details, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if the claim is based on a thorough analysis and comparison of the commission's actions with the provisions of Article 48, it would be considered credible.

However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume we are evaluating the claim based on hypothetical data or a general understanding of typical inflation rates.

If the rate was significantly different, such as 5% or 15%, the claim might be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

The success of the Rio 2016 Olympics depended on infrastructure development, security measures, financial support, and logistical coordination, which typically involve both federal and state governments.

Given the complexity and scale of the Olympics, it is highly unlikely that there was no partnership whatsoever between the federal and state governments. While the extent and nature of this partnership can vary, some level of cooperation is generally necessary.

Therefore, the claim that there was no partnership with the federal and state governments for the realization of Rio 2016 is likely an overstatement.

However, other European countries also provide various forms of subsidiary or humanitarian protection, even if the terminology and specifics may differ. For example, countries like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have their own mechanisms for providing protection to individuals who do not meet the criteria for refugee status but still face serious threats in their home countries.

Given this broader context, the claim that humanitarian protection is only available in Italy and Slovakia is not accurate. Other European countries also offer forms of protection similar to humanitarian protection.

"O Joaquim Barbosa mesmo disse, nessa época do Mensalão, que eu era o único deputado da base aliada do governo que não pegou dinheiro na Petrobras",half true,pt,"'Joaquim Barbosa himself said, during the Mensalão period, that I was the only deputy from the government's allied base who did not take money from Petrobras'.","To evaluate the claim that ""Joaquim Barbosa himself said, during the Mensalão period, that I was the only deputy from the government's allied base who did not take money from Petrobras,"" we need to consider the context and the available evidence.

Joaquim Barbosa was a prominent figure in Brazilian politics and served as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Federal Court during the Mensalão trial. The Mensalão scandal involved allegations of corruption and bribery within the Brazilian government. However, there is no widely documented statement from Joaquim Barbosa specifically identifying any individual deputy as the only one not involved in the Petrobras corruption scheme.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support this claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is likely exaggerated or unfounded.

This includes information on specific regions, types of investments, and sources of funding. Without such details, a definitive answer cannot be provided.

However, generally speaking, it is unlikely that there has been absolutely no investment in basic sanitation globally since 2015, given the ongoing efforts by governments, international organizations, and NGOs to improve sanitation infrastructure.

Based on this general knowledge, the claim is likely exaggerated. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

For example, the Catholic Church, which is influential in Italy, places a high value on the role of mothers. Additionally, Italy has a relatively strong tradition of family-centric values.

Given the lack of a specific, official designation but recognizing the cultural significance of motherhood in Italy, the claim could be considered:

The PT (Partido dos Trabalhadores) administration in Brazil ended with the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in August 2016. Michel Temer, who was Rousseff's Vice President, took over the presidency until the end of 2018. Therefore, the budget deficit in 2017 would be under the Temer administration, not the PT administration.

Given this context, the claim that the PT administration left a budget deficit of R$7 billion in 2017 is inaccurate because the PT was not in power during that year.

2. **Márcio França's Role**: Confirm that Márcio França was in a position of authority with the responsibility to execute such an order.
3. **Compliance with the Order**: Investigate whether Márcio França took the necessary actions to comply with the court order or if there was a failure to do so.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the most recent estimates from various sources indicate that the number of people living in poverty in Brazil is significant but does not reach 52 million.

According to data from the World Bank and other international organizations, the number of people living below the poverty line in Brazil is typically reported to be around 40-45 million. This figure can vary slightly depending on the source and the specific definition of poverty used.

Given this information, the claim that Brazil has 52 million people below the poverty line is overstated. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

The Alcântara Launch Center (Centro de Lançamento de Alcântara) is a Brazilian spaceport located in the state of Maranhão. The technology safeguards agreement (TSA) is a critical component for enabling the use of the spaceport by other countries, particularly the United States, due to concerns over the protection of sensitive technology.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the signing of the TSA between Brazil and the United States has been a significant milestone in defense and space cooperation. This agreement is intended to allow the use of U.S. technology at the Alcântara Launch Center, thereby making the spaceport more viable for commercial and strategic purposes.

Given this context, the claim that the signing of the technology safeguards agreement makes the Alcântara Launch Center viable is generally accurate, as it opens up opportunities for increased use and investment in the spaceport.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many public markets and businesses around the world were subject to closures or reduced operations to limit the spread of the virus. However, the extent and duration of these closures varied widely depending on local policies and the severity of the pandemic in different regions.

In Porto Alegre, while there were restrictions and closures of various businesses and public places, it is not accurate to say that the Public Market remained entirely closed throughout the pandemic. Many essential services, including some market operations, continued with modified hours or safety protocols in place.

Given this context, the claim that the Public Market of Porto Alegre remained closed during the pandemic is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth.

The PT government in Brazil has been associated with several significant anti-corruption measures. For instance, during the PT administration under President Lula and later under President Dilma Rousseff, several anti-corruption laws were indeed approved. Notable examples include the Clean Company Act (Lei Anticorrupção) and other legal frameworks aimed at combating corruption.

However, it is important to note that anti-corruption laws have also been enacted under other governments before and after the PT administration. Therefore, the claim that no anti-corruption law has been approved outside of the PT government is not entirely accurate.

Considering this context, the claim is overstated and does not fully reflect the historical reality of anti-corruption legislation in Brazil.

Without specific details or external verification, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the information provided in the claim itself, here's a breakdown:

1. **Number of Vests**: The claim states that 35 thousand bulletproof vests were bought. Without external verification, we cannot confirm if this number is accurate.
2. **Quality of Vests**: The claim asserts that these are ""the best vests available in the world."" This is subjective and would require independent assessment of the vests' specifications and performance.
3. **Method of Acquisition**: The claim mentions an ""international auction."" This detail adds some plausibility but still requires verification.

According to the National Council of Justice (CNJ), the number of lawsuits in the Brazilian judicial system has been high, but it has not reached 100 million. The most recent data available at the time of my last update indicated that the number of pending cases was in the tens of millions, but not 100 million.

Will I be censored by communist censorship with evidence?'","To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its key components:

1. **Photo Removal by Facebook in 2015**: The claim states that a photo was removed by Facebook in 2015 because it was deemed to tarnish President Dilma's image. Without specific evidence or documentation supporting this event, it's difficult to verify its truthfulness.

2. **Palocci's Confession**: The claim mentions that Palocci's confession confirms links between narco-trafficking and the financing of communist politicians' campaigns. While Antonio Palocci, a former finance minister in Brazil, did make allegations of corruption involving various politicians, the specific details of these allegations and their connection to narco-trafficking would need to be verified with credible sources.

3. **Reposting the Photo**: The claim suggests that the photo is being reposted, implying that the original removal was unjustified. Again, without evidence of the photo's content and the reasons for its removal, this part of the claim is uncertain.

4. **Censorship by Communists**: The claim implies that censorship is driven by communists, which is a speculative and politically charged assertion. Without concrete evidence linking the censorship directly to communist influence, this claim is highly debatable.

Given the lack of verifiable evidence for the key components of the claim, and the speculative nature of the assertions, the claim cannot be substantiated as true.

Without specific data, it's difficult to make a definitive statement.

"(...) O número de casos de HIV sobe, e o número de [casos de] Aids cai",true,pt,"'(...) The number of HIV cases is rising, and the number of AIDS cases is falling.'","To evaluate the claim that ""The number of HIV cases is rising, and the number of AIDS cases is falling,"" we need to consider the data and trends related to HIV and AIDS globally.

### Analysis:

1. **HIV Cases:**
   - According to recent data from sources like the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS, the number of new HIV infections has been declining globally. However, the total number of people living with HIV continues to rise due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), which prolongs life and reduces mortality rates.

2. **AIDS Cases:**
   - AIDS cases have been decreasing due to the widespread use of ART. Effective treatment can prevent the progression of HIV to AIDS, leading to a reduction in the number of people developing AIDS.

### Conclusion:

While the number of people living with HIV is rising, this is primarily due to longer lifespans thanks to ART, rather than an increase in new infections. The number of AIDS cases is indeed falling due to effective treatment.

Não temos piso [salarial] da segurança pública,true,pt,'We do not have a salary floor for public security.',"To evaluate the claim ""We do not have a salary floor for public security,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of the public security sector in question. Generally, many countries and jurisdictions do have minimum salary standards or floors for public sector employees, including those in public security.

However, without specific information about the jurisdiction or country being referred to, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. If the claim is made in a context where salary floors are typically mandated by law or collective bargaining agreements, then the claim would likely be false.

Given the general understanding that public sector employees, including those in public security, often have minimum wage protections or salary floors, the claim seems unlikely to be true without additional context.

The claim states that the federal government used R$ 1.114 trillion, which is 16.8% of GDP. This type of claim often involves comparing specific financial data to the GDP of a country.

1. **Verify the Total Amount Spent**: Check if the federal government indeed spent R$ 1.114 trillion.
2. **Verify the GDP**: Confirm the GDP value to calculate the percentage.
3. **Calculate the Percentage**: Ensure that R$ 1.114 trillion is indeed 16.8% of the GDP.

Without specific data on the GDP and the actual spending, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim. However, assuming the data provided is accurate and correctly referenced, the claim would be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **True**: If both the spending amount and the percentage of GDP are accurately reported and match official data.
- **Mostly True**: If there are minor discrepancies that do not significantly affect the overall accuracy.
- **Half True**: If there are notable discrepancies but the general claim holds some truth.
- **Mostly False**: If the claim contains significant inaccuracies.
- **False**: If the claim is entirely inaccurate.

Without access to real-time data or specific sources, we can provide a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. **Debt Growth**: We would need to check recent economic reports to see if Italy's debt has indeed stopped growing.
2. **Employment**: Verifying if there are one million more employed people would require looking at official employment statistics over a comparable period.
3. **Confidence Levels**: Measuring the confidence of businesses and families typically involves surveys and economic indicators. We would need to consult relevant indices or surveys.

Given that we don't have access to specific, current data, we can't definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, for the sake of this exercise, I would classify the claim as ""Half True"" based on the understanding that some elements might be accurate while others could be exaggerated or incomplete.

"«Un tema, quello della #regolarizzazione e del superamento della #Bossi-Fini che era nell’accordo di governo, nel segno della discontinuità con il #ConteI»",half true,it,"""A topic, that of #regularization and overcoming the #Bossi-Fini law, which was in the government agreement, in the spirit of discontinuity with #ConteI.""","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and facts surrounding it. The claim mentions two key points: regularization and overcoming the Bossi-Fini law, and it asserts that these topics were part of a government agreement in the spirit of discontinuity with the first Conte government (Conte I).

1. **Regularization**: This generally refers to policies aimed at legalizing the status of undocumented immigrants.
2. **Overcoming the Bossi-Fini law**: The Bossi-Fini law is an Italian immigration law known for its strict regulations. Overcoming this would imply a move towards more lenient immigration policies.

The spirit of discontinuity with Conte I suggests that the new government agreement sought to differentiate itself from the policies of the previous government led by Giuseppe Conte.

Without specific details on the government agreement in question, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if these topics were indeed part of a government agreement and were framed as a departure from Conte I's policies, the claim would have some truth to it.

Given the complexity and the need for specific context, I would assess the claim as:

"“Del total de jóvenes que no estudian ni trabajan en la Provincia de Buenos Aires, el 75% son mujeres”",true,es,"""Of the total number of young people who neither study nor work in the Province of Buenos Aires, 75% are women.""","To evaluate the claim ""Of the total number of young people who neither study nor work in the Province of Buenos Aires, 75% are women,"" we need to consider the data and context provided.

However, without specific data or context, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Generally, such claims require statistical data from reliable sources, such as government reports, academic studies, or surveys conducted by reputable organizations.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim cannot be fully validated or refuted. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

L’epidemia di Covid-19 ha peggiorato le già cattive condizioni lavorative dei giovani in Italia,true,it,The Covid-19 pandemic has worsened the already poor working conditions of young people in Italy.,"To evaluate the claim that ""The Covid-19 pandemic has worsened the already poor working conditions of young people in Italy,"" we need to consider the impact of the pandemic on youth employment and working conditions in Italy.

Several studies and reports indicate that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on the global economy, including Italy. Young people, in particular, have been disproportionately affected due to their overrepresentation in sectors such as hospitality, tourism, and retail, which were hit hard by lockdowns and restrictions.

In Italy, youth unemployment rates were already high before the pandemic. According to Eurostat, Italy had one of the highest youth unemployment rates in the European Union. The pandemic exacerbated this situation by causing job losses, reduced working hours, and increased job insecurity. Additionally, the economic downturn and uncertainty have made it more challenging for young people to find stable employment.

Given this context, it is reasonable to conclude that the Covid-19 pandemic has indeed worsened the already poor working conditions of young people in Italy.

"«Sono per rendere legale l'eutanasia, come c’è in molti Paesi»",half true,it,"""I am in favor of legalizing euthanasia, as it is in many countries.""","The claim ""I am in favor of legalizing euthanasia, as it is in many countries"" is complex because it combines a personal opinion with a factual statement. The personal opinion (""I am in favor of legalizing euthanasia"") is not something that can be fact-checked as true or false. However, the factual statement (""as it is in many countries"") can be evaluated.

Euthanasia is indeed legal in several countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Canada, among others. Therefore, the claim that euthanasia is legal in many countries is accurate.

However, the overall claim mixes a personal stance with a factual statement. Since the factual part is true, but the personal opinion cannot be objectively evaluated, the claim as a whole is best described as 'Mostly True'.

"No, lo stipendio di Salvini non è pagato solo dagli italiani",false,it,"'No, Salvini's salary is not paid only by Italians'.","To evaluate the claim ""No, Salvini's salary is not paid only by Italians,"" we need to consider how the salary of a political figure like Matteo Salvini, who has held positions in the Italian government and the European Parliament, is funded.

1. **Italian Government Salary**: If Salvini is serving in the Italian government, his salary is primarily funded by Italian taxpayers.
2. **European Parliament Salary**: If Salvini is a member of the European Parliament, his salary is funded by the European Union, which includes contributions from all member states, not just Italy.

Given that Salvini has held positions in both the Italian government and the European Parliament, it is accurate to say that his salary has been funded by sources beyond just Italian taxpayers, particularly during his tenure in the European Parliament.

Therefore, the claim that ""No, Salvini's salary is not paid only by Italians"" is accurate.

"Sabia que, só em Brasília, tem 40 mil pescadores cadastrados recebendo auxílio-pesca? (imagem)",false,pt,"Did you know that, in Brasília alone, there are 40 thousand registered fishermen receiving fishing aid? (image)","To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and available data regarding registered fishermen in Brasília and the provision of fishing aid.

**Claim Analysis:**
1. **Registered Fishermen in Brasília:** The claim states there are 40,000 registered fishermen in Brasília.
2. **Receiving Fishing Aid:** The claim also states these fishermen are receiving fishing aid.

**Evaluation:**
- **Data Verification:** Accurate and up-to-date data on the number of registered fishermen in Brasília and the provision of fishing aid would be necessary to validate this claim.
- **Contextual Information:** Brasília, being the capital of Brazil, is not typically known for having a large fishermen population due to its inland location.

Given the lack of specific data in the claim and the general understanding of Brasília's demographics, it is reasonable to assume that the number of registered fishermen and the extent of fishing aid might not align with the claim.

**Conclusion:**
Without concrete data, the claim seems exaggerated. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

"(Doria) Foi violentamente criticado por uma propaganda do turismo brasileiro com bundas de mulher na praia, estimulando claramente o turismo sexual",half true,pt,"'(Doria) Was violently criticized for an advertisement promoting Brazilian tourism that featured women's buttocks on the beach, clearly encouraging sex tourism'.","The claim that a Brazilian tourism advertisement promoted by Doria was criticized for featuring women's buttocks on the beach and encouraging sex tourism is a specific allegation. To accurately assess its truthfulness, further context and verification are necessary. However, it is known that Brazil has faced criticisms in the past for tourism promotions that have been perceived as objectifying women and promoting sex tourism.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim and the general historical context, it is reasonable to conclude that while the advertisement may have been criticized, the extent and specifics of the criticism would need further verification.

[O desmatamento ilegal] Subiu de 2012 pra cá em torno de 37%,mostly true,pt,'[Illegal deforestation] Increased from 2012 to present by around 37%'.,"To evaluate the claim that illegal deforestation has increased by around 37% from 2012 to the present, we would need to look at data from reliable sources such as environmental organizations, government reports, or academic studies. Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can provide a general approach to how one might evaluate such a claim.

1. **Check Official Reports**: Organizations like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and governmental environmental agencies often publish reports on deforestation trends.

2. **Compare Data**: Look for data points from 2012 and the most recent years available. Compare these to see if there is a significant increase and if it aligns with a 37% rise.

3. **Cross-Reference Sources**: Verify the information with multiple sources to ensure accuracy and reliability.

4. **Consider Context**: Understand the context of the claim, including any regional specifics or factors that might affect deforestation rates.

Without access to specific data, a claim of a 37% increase in illegal deforestation from 2012 to the present could be plausible given the ongoing concerns about deforestation, but it would need verification from credible sources.

**Final Answer: Half True**

(This answer is based on the assumption that while there might be an increase in deforestation, the exact percentage and the legality of the deforestation would need specific data for verification.)",half true,False,False

However, as of my last update in October 2023, I do not have real-time access to external databases or the most recent data.

In general, claims about average pensions can vary depending on the source and the time period considered. If the claim is based on recent and verifiable data from the INSS, it could be considered accurate. However, without specific data to corroborate the claim, it is difficult to definitively assert its truthfulness.

Given the lack of specific data, a cautious approach would be to classify the claim as 'Half True', as it may reflect a general trend or approximate value but cannot be definitively verified without additional context or data.

The withdrawal of emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA actually means that the FDA no longer permits the drug to be used for the specific emergency purpose under the EUA. This typically restricts the drug's use to its previously approved indications, rather than expanding its treatment options.

“O deputado estadual tem R$ 40 mil para patrocinar o seu mandato”,true,pt,"""The state deputy has R$ 40 thousand to sponsor their term.""","To evaluate the claim that ""The state deputy has R$ 40 thousand to sponsor their term,"" we need to consider the context and typical financial resources available to state deputies. Generally, state deputies in Brazil receive a certain amount of money to cover office expenses, known as the ""verba de gabinete."" The actual amount can vary and is subject to regulations and changes over time.

Without specific and up-to-date information on the current amount allocated to state deputies for their term, it is challenging to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, based on general knowledge and previous reports, it is common for state deputies to receive a significant amount of money for office expenses, but the exact figure of R$ 40 thousand may not be accurate without verification.

Given the lack of precise and current data, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not fully verifiable. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Without specific details such as the location, organizing entity, or date, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, based on general knowledge and the lack of widely recognized events with such a title, it is unlikely that such a seminar has been held, especially with the specific focus on children and LGBT topics.

1. **Fund Allocation**: The government setting aside €2 billion to cover a larger deficit is a factual statement that can be verified through official government announcements or budget documents.

2. **Impact on Sectors**: The claim that this will result in €2 billion in cuts to businesses, transportation, and universities is more speculative. While it's possible that budget cuts could affect these areas, the specific allocation of cuts would depend on government policy and may not be evenly distributed or solely targeted at these sectors.

3. **Public Awareness**: The statement that ""Italians have not yet realized"" is subjective and difficult to quantify. It suggests a lack of public awareness or understanding, which may or may not be accurate depending on various factors such as media coverage and public engagement.

4. **Timing and Control**: The mention of the Commission tightening control over Italian public accounts starting next July adds another layer of complexity. This would depend on the specifics of EU regulations and the Commission's timeline for such actions.

Given these considerations, the claim contains elements that are factual (fund allocation) and elements that are speculative or subjective (impacts on specific sectors and public awareness). Therefore, the claim is not entirely true but contains elements of truth.

2. The same left promotes abortion.

The first assertion is generally true; many individuals and groups on the political left express concern over gun violence and the death of innocent victims, including children.

The second assertion is also generally true; many individuals and groups on the political left support abortion rights.

However, the claim presents these two assertions as if they are contradictory or hypocritical, which is a matter of interpretation and opinion. The political left generally supports both reducing gun violence and protecting abortion rights, but these positions are not necessarily contradictory, as they involve different contexts, principles, and policy goals.

Therefore, while the individual assertions are mostly true, the overall claim is misleading and oversimplifies complex political positions.

1. **""In the year 2009, the H1N1 flu killed many more people than COVID-19""**: This is not accurate. As of the latest available data, COVID-19 has killed significantly more people globally than the H1N1 flu did in 2009. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused an estimated 151,700 to 575,400 deaths worldwide during its first year. In contrast, COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths globally since its emergence in late 2019.

2. **""Your government under Lula didn't give you a single cent""**: This is a specific claim about Brazil under the presidency of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Without specific data on financial aid provided during the H1N1 pandemic in Brazil, this claim cannot be definitively verified or refuted. However, it is important to note that governments often respond to pandemics with various measures, including financial aid, depending on the context and severity of the crisis.

3. **""The rotten media kept quiet, didn't talk about isolation or anything""**: This claim suggests that the media did not cover the H1N1 pandemic adequately. However, there was significant media coverage of the H1N1 pandemic globally, including discussions about isolation and other public health measures. The claim that the media ""kept quiet"" is not supported by the historical record.

Given the inaccuracies in the first and third points, and the lack of verifiable information on the second point, the overall claim is mostly false.

"Criação de uma Corregedoria externa, fora da estrutura da Secretaria de Segurança Pública",false,pt,"'Creation of an external Ombudsman's Office, outside the structure of the Secretariat of Public Security'.","To evaluate the claim ""Creation of an external Ombudsman's Office, outside the structure of the Secretariat of Public Security,"" we need context or additional information to determine its veracity. Without specific details about the jurisdiction, the time frame, or the source of the claim, it's challenging to provide an accurate assessment.

However, assuming the claim is about a specific proposal or action in a given context, and without any contradictory evidence, the statement appears to be a plausible policy or organizational change.

Estamos (...) com recorde de desemprego,false,pt,'We are (...) with a record of unemployment'.,"To evaluate the claim ""We are (...) with a record of unemployment,"" we need more context, such as the specific time period, location, and what ""record of unemployment"" means (e.g., highest, lowest, specific trend, etc.). Without this context, it's impossible to accurately determine the truthfulness of the statement.

However, based on the incomplete sentence and lack of specific details, the claim cannot be verified. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

O programa vai beneficiar 4 milhões de crianças entre 0 e 3 anos [até o final de 2018],false,pt,'The program will benefit 4 million children between 0 and 3 years old [by the end of 2018].',"To evaluate the claim, I would need additional context, such as the specific program being referred to, the source of the claim, and any available data or reports that could verify the numbers. Without this information, it's not possible to accurately determine the truthfulness of the statement.

However, if we are to assume that the claim is being made based on some official or credible source, and if there is data to back up the projected impact of the program, then it could potentially be considered 'Mostly True' or 'True'.

If the claim lacks supporting evidence or if there are significant discrepancies in the data, it could be considered 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

É inadmissível uma dívida – inclusive de bancos e de grandes empresas (...) – [com] a prefeitura de São Paulo que seja da ordem de mais de R$ 130 milhões,false,pt,It is unacceptable for a debt – including those of banks and large companies (...) – to the municipality of São Paulo to be in the order of more than R$ 130 million.,"To evaluate the claim that debts to the municipality of São Paulo, including those of banks and large companies, are unacceptable if they exceed R$ 130 million, we need to consider multiple factors such as the context, legal framework, and economic impacts.

1. **Context and Legal Framework**: In many jurisdictions, including Brazil, large debts owed to municipalities can be seen as problematic due to their potential impact on public services and the economy. The specific amount deemed unacceptable might vary based on local legislation and economic conditions.

2. **Economic Impact**: Large debts can strain municipal finances, affecting the provision of essential services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

3. **Enforcement and Collection**: The ability of the municipality to enforce and collect large debts is crucial. If debts from banks and large companies are not being adequately addressed, it could indicate issues with enforcement mechanisms.

Without specific data on the legal and economic context in São Paulo, it is challenging to definitively conclude whether a debt of over R$ 130 million is unacceptable. However, generally, large debts owed to municipalities are seen as detrimental due to their potential economic and social impacts.

"Há 56 anos, um violento confronto entre as forças policiais da RDA, e......",true,pt,"'56 years ago, a violent confrontation between the police forces of the GDR, and......'","To evaluate the claim, we need more context or a specific event to verify its accuracy. The claim mentions a ""violent confrontation between the police forces of the GDR (German Democratic Republic) and ..."" but does not specify the other party involved or provide enough details to pinpoint a particular incident.

However, historically, there were indeed several notable confrontations involving the police forces of the GDR, such as the uprising of 1953 or events leading up to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Without additional context, it's challenging to definitively classify the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Given the historical context of the GDR and known events, it is plausible that such a confrontation occurred. Therefore, a cautious evaluation would lean towards:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
(...) Nossa expectativa é que [as membranas e cortinas de contenção de rejeitos instaladas em Pará de Minas] seja o suficiente para conter esse rejeito e não permitir nenhum problema para a captação de água do Rio [Paraopeba],false,pt,'(...) Our expectation is that [the membranes and containment curtains for waste installed in Pará de Minas] will be sufficient to contain this waste and not allow any problems for the water capture from the [Paraopeba] River'.,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the effectiveness and reliability of membranes and containment curtains in preventing waste from contaminating water sources, specifically in the context of Pará de Minas and the Paraopeba River.

Membranes and containment curtains are designed to prevent the spread of contaminants, but their effectiveness can be influenced by various factors such as installation quality, maintenance, the nature of the waste, and environmental conditions. Without specific data on the quality and maintenance of these systems in Pará de Minas, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim.

However, generally speaking, well-maintained and properly installed membranes and containment curtains can significantly reduce the risk of contamination. Therefore, the claim that these measures will be sufficient to prevent problems with water capture from the Paraopeba River is likely overly optimistic but not entirely false.

“En ningún país del mundo un gobierno se rige con un presupuesto opositor”,half true,es,"""In no country in the world does a government operate with an opposition budget.""","The claim that ""In no country in the world does a government operate with an opposition budget"" is largely accurate because, in most parliamentary systems, the government in power is responsible for presenting the budget, and the opposition typically critiques rather than proposes an alternative budget. However, there are exceptions where opposition parties may present alternative budgets or proposals, even if these are not formally adopted.

1. **Specificity**: The claim mentions a specific amount (""more than 15 million reais in products"") and types of products (grocery bags, basic food baskets).
2. **Verifiability**: Without additional context or verification from a reputable source, it's difficult to confirm if the Extra group is indeed donating these products.
3. **Call to Action**: The request to comment ""OK"" to be contacted suggests a potential phishing or scam tactic, which is a common red flag.

Given the lack of verifiable information and the suspicious call to action, the claim appears dubious.

However, the claim suggests that BNDES is willing to redirect resources for reconstruction and restoration efforts. If this statement comes from an official BNDES announcement or a credible source quoting BNDES, it is likely to be true or mostly true.

In 2013, the Brazilian government, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, signed an agreement with Cuba to bring Cuban doctors to Brazil as part of the ""Mais Médicos"" (More Doctors) program. The number of doctors initially agreed upon was indeed around 10,000. However, the characterization of the Cuban government as a ""dictatorship"" adds a political perspective that may be subject to debate.

November 3, 2018, is a valid date, and 14:18:33 UTC is a valid time. Since there is no inherent falsity in the statement and it refers to a specific point in time that did occur, the claim is true.

Brasília (...) tem remuneração de policiais paga pelo governo federal,true,pt,'Brasília (...) has police officer remuneration paid by the federal government'.,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Brasília (...) has police officer remuneration paid by the federal government,"" we need to understand the administrative structure of Brasília and the funding of its police forces.

Brasília, as the capital of Brazil, is part of the Federal District, which has a unique status different from other states in the country. The Federal District has its own police forces, including the Military Police and the Civil Police, which are distinct from the federal police forces.

The funding for the police forces in the Federal District, including Brasília, typically comes from the budget of the Federal District government, not directly from the federal government. However, the federal government may provide additional funding or support for specific projects or initiatives related to public security.

Given this context, the claim that police officer remuneration in Brasília is paid by the federal government is not entirely accurate. While the federal government may provide some funding, the primary responsibility for police officer remuneration in Brasília lies with the Federal District government.

Without access to such details, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume Gentiloni made claims about Italy's industrial production and exports that contradict widely accepted data from reliable sources like the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) or international trade reports. If these sources show significant discrepancies with Gentiloni's statements, the claim could be considered accurate.

“[Entre 2010 y 2013] la cantidad invertida en Educación y Salud en Brasil fue de 212 veces más que la cantidad invertida en los estadios”,true,es,"""Between 2010 and 2013, the amount invested in Education and Health in Brazil was 212 times more than the amount invested in stadiums.""","To evaluate the claim that ""Between 2010 and 2013, the amount invested in Education and Health in Brazil was 212 times more than the amount invested in stadiums,"" we need to consider the available data and context.

First, it's important to note that investments in education and health typically constitute a significant portion of a country's budget, while investments in stadiums are usually much smaller and more specific. The claim suggests an extremely large disparity, which may seem implausible without specific data to support it.

Without precise figures, we can infer that:
1. Education and health are major areas of public spending.
2. Stadium investments, while significant for events like the World Cup or Olympics, are generally much smaller in comparison.

Given the typical scale of these investments, it's unlikely that the investment in education and health would be 212 times greater than that in stadiums. This number seems exaggerated.

Therefore, considering the context and the likely scale of investments, the claim appears to be an overstatement.

Explanation: The statement ""An article about an alleged vaccine conspiracy spread across social media"" could be Half True because while it's possible that an article discussing an alleged vaccine conspiracy did spread across social media, without specific details or verification of the content and extent of its spread, it's difficult to definitively label it as entirely true or false.",half true,False,False

Many of the bacteria in a dog's mouth are specific to dogs and may not cause disease in humans. However, there are some zoonotic diseases that can be transmitted from dogs to humans through saliva, such as ringworm, MRSA, and in rare cases, Capnocytophaga canimorsus. The risk is generally low for individuals with healthy immune systems. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but not entirely false either.

"‌ ‌“Cuando nosotros llegamos en diciembre nos encontramos un Banco Central lánguido, sin reservas, vacío”‌ ‌",false,es,"""When we arrived in December, we found a languid Central Bank, with no reserves, empty.""","To evaluate the claim ""When we arrived in December, we found a languid Central Bank, with no reserves, empty,"" we need to consider the context and available data regarding the Central Bank's reserves at the time of the arrival in December. Without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide an accurate assessment. However, claims about a central bank having ""no reserves"" and being ""empty"" are typically extreme and would require substantial evidence to be considered true.

Given the lack of specific data and the extreme nature of the claim, it is likely an exaggeration. Central banks usually maintain some level of reserves, even if they are low. Therefore, the claim is likely not entirely accurate.
