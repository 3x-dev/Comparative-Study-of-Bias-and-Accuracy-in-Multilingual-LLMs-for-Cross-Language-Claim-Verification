სახელმწიფო ბიუჯეტის ხარჯვით ნაწილს ლარის გაუფასურებაზე გავლენა არ ჰქონია,mostly false,ka,"""The expenditure of the state budget will have no impact on the devaluation of the lari.""","The claim that ""The expenditure of the state budget will have no impact on the devaluation of the lari"" is a complex one that requires economic analysis. Generally, a state's budget expenditure can have various effects on its currency's value, depending on factors such as fiscal policy, monetary policy, economic conditions, and market sentiment. If the state's expenditure leads to a significant fiscal deficit, it could potentially put downward pressure on the currency due to increased debt or inflationary expectations. Conversely, if the expenditure is part of a well-managed fiscal policy that stimulates economic growth, it might have a stabilizing or even appreciative effect on the currency.

Given the complexity and the need for context-specific analysis, it is not accurate to say that the expenditure of the state budget will have ""no impact"" on the devaluation of the lari. Therefore, the claim is oversimplified and likely not entirely accurate.

Without access to such data, it is impossible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on publicly available data, we can consider the following general approach to evaluate its accuracy:

1. **Check Voter Turnout Data**: Compare the voter turnout rates in Kutaisi with those in other cities or regions to see if Kutaisi indeed has the lowest participation rate.
2. **Analyze Trends**: Look at historical data to see if there is a consistent trend of lower voter turnout in Kutaisi.
3. **Consider Context**: Factor in any contextual information that might affect voter turnout, such as local issues, demographics, or political climate.

Without knowing the specific country or jurisdiction in question, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

However, in many democratic systems, there are laws or regulations that control the salaries of political office holders, and these often include provisions that restrict salary increases during specific periods or under certain conditions. For instance, in the United States, there are mechanisms in place to control the salaries of members of Congress, such as the 27th Amendment, which delays salary changes until the next term of office.

Given the general nature of the claim and the common practice of regulating political salaries, it is plausible that such a restriction could exist. However, without specific context or evidence, the claim cannot be fully verified.

1. **Duration of Elections**: The claim states that the Ministry of Education has been conducting director elections for 2 years. This part of the claim can be verified by checking official records or announcements from the Ministry of Education.

2. **Percentage of School Boards**: The claim states that these elections have been conducted in 80% of school boards of trustees. This part of the claim can be verified by checking data or reports from the Ministry of Education or other reputable sources.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general economic trends and typical patterns in agricultural GDP, we can make an educated assessment.

1. **Economic Context**: The period from 2004 to 2012 includes the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, which had significant impacts on various economic sectors, including agriculture.
2. **Agricultural Sector Trends**: Agricultural GDP can be influenced by numerous factors such as weather conditions, global commodity prices, trade policies, and technological advancements.

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{250}{60,000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{250}{60,000} \right) \times 100 \approx 0.4167\% \]

This means that approximately 93.3% (14 million out of 15 million) of the budget is allocated to salaries and various expenses. This is a significant majority of the budget.

Given this information, the claim appears to be largely accurate, as the vast majority of the budget is indeed allocated to salaries and various expenses.

In European and American academic institutions, academic freedom typically refers to the freedom of teachers and students to engage in intellectual debate and pursue research without fear of censorship or retaliation. Administrative heads, such as university presidents or deans, have significant responsibilities that may include overseeing academic programs, managing budgets, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. While they may have less freedom to engage in controversial academic pursuits compared to faculty members, they still enjoy a degree of academic freedom within their roles.

However, administrative heads are often constrained by institutional policies, legal requirements, and the need to maintain institutional stability and reputation. These constraints can limit their ability to engage in certain types of academic activities or express controversial opinions in the same way that faculty members might.

Considering these factors, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true. It is more accurate to say that administrative heads have some limitations on their academic freedom due to their roles and responsibilities, but they are not completely devoid of it.

2017 წლის პირველ კვარტალში ევროკავშირში ქართული ექსპორტი 44%-ით გაიზარდა,true,ka,"In the first quarter of 2017, Georgian exports to the European Union increased by 44%.","To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In the first quarter of 2017, Georgian exports to the European Union increased by 44%,"" we would typically need to consult reliable sources such as official trade statistics from the Georgian government, the European Union, or international trade organizations. Since I don't have real-time access to these databases, I'll provide a general approach to verifying this claim and then give an educated guess based on available information.

1. **Check Official Trade Statistics**: Look for reports from the Georgian National Statistics Office (Geostat) or the European Union's statistical office (Eurostat).
2. **Consult International Trade Reports**: Organizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the International Monetary Fund (IMF) often publish detailed trade reports.
3. **Review News Articles and Economic Reports**: Reputable news sources and economic analysis reports from the first quarter of 2017 might also contain relevant information.

Given that we are working with an assumption and not real-time data, the claim could be evaluated as follows:

- **True**: If multiple reliable sources confirm a 44% increase in Georgian exports to the EU in the first quarter of 2017.
- **Mostly True**: If there is a significant increase, close to but not exactly 44%, and the overall trend supports the claim.
- **Half True**: If there is an increase but it is substantially different from 44%, or if the data is mixed.
- **Mostly False**: If the increase is much lower than 44% or the data is inconclusive.
- **False**: If there is no significant increase or if the data contradicts the claim.

Without specific data, I can't definitively categorize the claim. However, based on typical economic reporting practices, claims of such specific increases are often examined closely and would likely fall into either ""Mostly True"" or ""Half True"" categories unless strongly supported or refuted by multiple sources.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False

As of the latest available data, Georgia has been experiencing economic growth, but whether it is higher than both its region (which might include countries like Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Russia) and the European Union requires specific comparative analysis.

Without access to real-time data and detailed economic reports, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general economic trends, Georgia's growth rate has been notable but not consistently higher than all regional countries or the entire EU. The EU, for example, has had varied growth rates among its member states, with some performing very strongly.

Given these considerations, a balanced assessment would likely be:

The North-South International Corridor is a multi-modal transport network connecting India, Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, and Europe, designed to facilitate the flow of goods between these regions. Georgia is a key transit country in this corridor, given its strategic location between Azerbaijan and Russia.

As of the latest available information, Georgia is actively involved in the North-South International Corridor project. The country has been enhancing its infrastructure, including railways and ports, to support the corridor's objectives. Therefore, the claim that Georgia has missed the chance to participate is inaccurate.

However, in many jurisdictions, there are often different approaches to handling illegal border crossings based on factors such as the reason for crossing, the status of the individual (e.g., asylum seeker vs. economic migrant), and the specific laws of the country in question.

These effects can include altered perception, mood changes, and impaired cognitive function, which are sometimes referred to as ""narcotic-like"" effects in a broader sense.

The term ""Nationals"" could refer to a specific event, such as a sports tournament, a political gathering, or another type of national event. The lack of specific details makes it difficult to confirm the accuracy of the arrests and their connection to the criminal world.

1. **Car Ownership Data**: We would need to compare the number of cars registered in Tbilisi before and after 2012 to verify if there was indeed a 2.5 times increase.

2. **Income Data**: We would need to examine economic indicators such as average income, GDP per capita, and other relevant economic metrics to determine if there was a corresponding increase in income.

Without access to specific data, it is challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, based on general economic principles, an increase in car ownership is often correlated with an increase in income levels, as people typically buy more cars when they have more disposable income.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim that the number of cars increased without a corresponding increase in income seems dubious but not entirely impossible. There could be other factors at play, such as changes in car financing options, government policies, or other economic dynamics.

However, the claim that they make up ""almost half"" of the unemployed is typically not supported by the data.

For example, according to the ILO, while youth unemployment rates are higher, the proportion of unemployed individuals in the 20-29 age group does not usually reach 50% of the total unemployed population.

2. **Retraction by the Individual**: The claim that the individual retracts their own vetoes implies a change of mind or acknowledgment of error. This would need to be supported by documentation or statements showing such retractions.

Without specific evidence or context, it's difficult to definitively categorize the claim.

2. **First Case**: Whether this was the ""first case"" depends on whether previous U.S. budget laws or other legislation had addressed the same issue. There is no widely known previous instance of a U.S. budget law specifically mentioning the occupation of Georgian territories in such a manner.

Given these points, the claim can be considered mostly accurate, as the signing of the 2018 budget law by Trump was a significant and notable instance where the occupation of Georgian territories was addressed in U.S. legislation.

While there could be some electronic manufacturing, it is not a major hub for these specific products.

Therefore, without specific evidence to support the claim that Rustavi manufactures all these items, it is likely that the claim is exaggerated.

Since I don't have access to the specific data or context that the claim refers to, I can't verify the numbers directly. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate such a claim:

1. **Check the Source**: Verify the source of the claim to ensure it is credible.
2. **Compare with Official Data**: Look for official reports or budget documents that detail the allocations for concerts and advertising expenses.
3. **Analyze the Increase**: Confirm whether the increases mentioned (2 million lari for concerts and 600 thousand lari for advertising) align with the official data.

If the increases match the official data, the claim would be 'True'. If there are slight discrepancies, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the increases partially match, it could be 'Half True'. If the discrepancies are significant, it would be 'Mostly False', and if the data is completely incorrect, it would be 'False'.

Without the actual data, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, based on the given information, here's a hypothetical evaluation:

- If the official data shows the increases are exactly 2 million lari for concerts and 600 thousand lari for advertising, the claim is 'True'.
- If there are minor discrepancies, the claim is 'Mostly True'.
- If the increases are only partially correct, the claim is 'Half True'.

If we assume the claim refers to the U.S. state of Georgia, we can look at historical economic data.

For example, in the early 1990s, Georgia's GDP was around $100 billion, and by 2020, it had grown to over $600 billion.

Given this context, the claim that Georgia's economy has grown from $4 billion to $16 billion is likely an exaggeration or a misstatement, as the actual figures are much higher. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but may contain a kernel of truth regarding economic growth.

The claim suggests that the President's Fund is exempt from audit, which is unlikely to be true in a system with robust accountability mechanisms.

However, without specific context or knowledge of the particular regulations governing ""The President's Fund"" in question, it is difficult to definitively say whether this claim is entirely false or if there might be some nuanced truth to it.

As of my last update in October 2023, there have been significant geopolitical tensions and conflicts between Russia and Ukraine, which have had various economic implications. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Geopolitical Impact**: The conflict has disrupted trade routes, leading to shifts in trade patterns. Countries like Georgia, which are geographically close, might see changes in their import and export dynamics.

2. **Trade Statistics**: To verify the claim, one would need to look at recent trade statistics between Georgia, Russia, and Ukraine. If there is a noticeable increase in exports from Russia and Ukraine to Georgia, the claim would be supported.

3. **Economic Sanctions and Embargoes**: The conflict has led to economic sanctions and embargoes, which could redirect trade flows. For example, if Russia and Ukraine face restrictions in exporting to certain markets, they might increase exports to other countries like Georgia.

4. **Logistical Considerations**: Georgia's geographical proximity makes it a potential alternative market for goods that cannot be exported elsewhere due to sanctions or logistical challenges.

Without specific and up-to-date trade data, it is challenging to definitively confirm the claim. However, given the known impacts of the conflict on trade patterns and the potential for redirected exports, it is plausible that there has been an increase in exports from Russia and Ukraine to Georgia.

1. **Loans to Commercial Banks**: When the National Bank (or any central bank) lends money to commercial banks, it increases the money supply in the economy. This can lead to inflation if not managed properly.

2. **Impact on Currency Value**: An increase in the money supply can put downward pressure on the value of the currency if it is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in economic productivity or demand for the currency. However, this is just one of many factors that can influence currency values.

3. **Other Factors**: Currency devaluation can also be caused by a variety of other factors, such as economic instability, trade deficits, political uncertainty, and global economic conditions.

Given these points, while it is possible that loans from the National Bank to commercial banks could contribute to the devaluation of the lari, it is unlikely to be the sole cause. The claim oversimplifies a complex economic issue.

However, the claim states that the monthly expenditure on pensions increased by only 28.3%. This disparity suggests that there might be other factors at play, such as a decrease in the number of pensioners or a change in the way pensions are calculated or distributed.

2. The claim mentions a maximum of 10% sports participation rate in an unspecified country. Without knowing which country this refers to, it's challenging to provide a precise comparison. However, sports participation rates can vary widely across different countries.

Given the general knowledge about Slovenia's active lifestyle and the lack of specific data for the unspecified country, the claim that Slovenia has a much higher sports participation rate (75%) compared to another country (maximum of 10%) is plausible but lacks concrete evidence to be fully verified.

1. **Initial Salary Expenditure**: 1.7 billion (assuming the currency is not specified, let's use a generic unit for calculation purposes).

2. **Reduction of Salary Expenditure by 20%**:
   \[
   \text{Reduction Amount} = 1.7 \text{ billion} \times 0.20 = 0.34 \text{ billion}

3. **Pension Increase**:
   - The claim states that reducing the salary expenditure by 20% means increasing the pension by 50 lari.
   - To determine if this is true, we need to compare the reduction amount with the pension increase.

4. **Conversion and Comparison**:
   - Assume 1 lari is the currency unit being referred to.
   - The reduction of 0.34 billion (340 million) should be compared to the pension increase of 50 lari.

Given that 340 million (0.34 billion) is significantly larger than 50 lari, the claim that reducing the salary expenditure by 20% (which amounts to 340 million) would only increase the pension by 50 lari seems highly disproportionate.

Given these points, while it is true that unemployment remains a problem and public debt has increased, the claim that the Georgian Dream has ""ruined the country"" is subjective and depends on broader context and additional factors not mentioned in the claim.

2. **Bonuses Received**: The claim mentions that these employees receive ""millions of lari in bonuses."" This would require financial records or reports from the Ministry to confirm the amounts paid in bonuses.

Without access to specific data or official records, it's challenging to verify the exact numbers. However, based on the information provided, we can make some logical inferences:

- If the claim about the number of off-payroll employees is accurate but the amount of bonuses is exaggerated, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True.'
- If both the number of employees and the bonuses are partially accurate but not entirely correct, the claim could be 'Half True.'
- If the number of employees is significantly less than 120 or the bonuses are not in the millions, the claim could be 'Mostly False.'
- If the statement is entirely inaccurate, it would be 'False.'

Without specific data or references, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, let's assume we have some context:

1. **Government Change**: If there was a change in the government around the time the claim suggests, we need to verify if this change led to any policy shifts or project halts.
2. **Coastal Protection Works**: We need to check if there were any ongoing coastal protection projects in Batumi and whether they continued, were paused, or stopped after the government change.
3. **Official Statements**: Any statements from government officials or project managers regarding the status of coastal protection works would be crucial.

A 180% increase from a certain value means that the value has nearly tripled (since 100% + 180% = 280%, or 2.8 times the original value).

Let's assume the number of bottles exported last year in April was \( X \).

A 180% increase would mean:
\[ X + 1.8X = 2.8X \]

If the current month's exports are 19 million bottles, then:
\[ 2.8X = 19 \text{ million bottles} \]
\[ X = \frac{19 \text{ million bottles}}{2.8} \]
\[ X \approx 6.79 \text{ million bottles} \]

So, if last year's exports were approximately 6.79 million bottles, and this year it increased to 19 million bottles, the claim of a 180% increase would be accurate.

Given that the new rate is 21%, we can set up the equation:

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 21 \times 3 \]

1. **Economic Principles:** High levels of foreign debt can indeed put pressure on a country's currency. This is because servicing the debt often requires the country to sell its currency to purchase foreign currency, which can lead to depreciation.

2. **Specific Context:** The impact of foreign debt on currency depreciation can vary depending on the specific economic conditions, policies, and external factors affecting the country at the time.

3. **Other Factors:** Currency depreciation can also be influenced by a range of other factors such as trade deficits, inflation, political instability, and global economic conditions.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively say whether foreign debts accumulated by the previous government are the primary or a significant reason for the depreciation of the lari. However, it is plausible that foreign debt could be one of the contributing factors.

Georgia has undergone significant economic changes since the early 2000s.

However, there have also been periods of slower growth and economic difficulties.

Without specific data, I can only provide a method to verify the claim rather than a definitive answer.

Here’s how you can verify the claim:

1. **Check Official Government Reports**: Look for budget reports or financial statements released by the government for the years 2012 and 2013.
2. **Consult International Organizations**: Organizations like the World Bank, IMF, or defense-related think tanks often publish data on national budgets, including defense spending.
3. **Review News Articles**: Reputable news outlets might have covered changes in the defense budget during those years.

If the data matches the claim (735 million Lari in 2012 and 660 million Lari in 2013), then the claim is 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies, it might be 'Mostly True'. Significant discrepancies would make it 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Since I don't have access to real-time data or specific sources, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, based on the method described, you can verify the claim yourself.

However, without specific data, we can consider general trends and information:

1. **Global Trends**: Many countries face electricity shortages, but the extent and growth rate of these deficits vary significantly. Some regions are improving their electricity infrastructure and production capacity, while others struggle with growing demand and insufficient supply.

2. **Regional Variations**: In some developing countries, electricity deficits are indeed large and growing annually due to factors like rapid urbanization, industrialization, and inadequate infrastructure investment. However, in developed countries, the situation is often more stable or improving.

3. **Renewable Energy**: The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources in many parts of the world is helping to mitigate electricity deficits, but the transition is not uniform and can be slow in some regions.

2. **Percentage of Crop Protected from Hail**: The claim states that 80-90% of the crop is protected from hail. This is a more specific and verifiable part of the claim. However, without access to detailed agricultural insurance data, we can't confirm the exact percentage.

Let's break it down:
- Total employment period: 3.5 years
- Time spent on business trips: 1 year

This means the director spent roughly 1/3.5 (or approximately 28.6%) of their time on business trips.

- As of the most recent data, there are 2,000 hotels in Georgia.
- Out of the current 2,000 hotels, 800 were built after 2012.

Based on this hypothetical data:
- 800 hotels were built under the rule of the 'Georgian Dream.'
- This accounts for 40% of the total number of hotels in Georgia (800 out of 2,000).

Given this hypothetical scenario, the claim that 'Almost half of the hotels in Georgia were created under the rule of the 'Georgian Dream'' would be mostly accurate, as 40% is close to, but not quite, half.

1. **Economic Theory**: Tax cuts can stimulate economic growth by increasing disposable income for consumers and businesses, which can lead to increased spending and investment. However, the impact on the budget is more complex. Tax cuts can reduce government revenue, potentially leading to budget deficits if spending is not reduced accordingly.

2. **Historical Evidence**: There are examples where tax cuts have led to economic growth, such as the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s in the United States. However, the impact on the budget varied; in some cases, the budget deficit increased.

3. **Conditions Matter**: The claim includes the phrase ""under these conditions,"" which suggests that specific circumstances might have contributed to the growth of both the budget and the economy. Without knowing these conditions, it is difficult to assess the claim accurately.

Given the mixed evidence and the need for specific conditions, the claim is not entirely true or false. It is more accurate to say that under certain conditions, tax cuts can contribute to economic growth, but the impact on the budget is less clear.

Per capita GDP (Gross Domestic Product per capita) is a measure of a country's economic output per person. Generally, many countries have seen an increase in per capita GDP over time due to economic growth and development. However, this growth is not always continuous and can be affected by various factors such as economic crises, pandemics, or other disruptions.

Given the general trend of economic growth in many countries, the claim that ""Per capita GDP is increasing and has not stopped"" is likely to be true in many cases. However, the claim that it has ""not stopped"" is a strong statement that would require specific data to verify for each country over a specified period.

Without specific data, the claim can be considered mostly true in a broad sense, as many countries do experience long-term increases in per capita GDP. However, there are periods of economic stagnation or decline that may contradict the claim of uninterrupted growth.

The phrase ""pounced on the taxpayers like a hawk"" suggests a predatory or aggressive increase in tax burdens or other financial impositions on taxpayers.

Without specific data or context, it is difficult to definitively categorize this claim. However, general trends in tax policy and public perception can provide some insight. If there has been a significant and widely criticized increase in taxes or new financial burdens imposed by the government, the claim might hold some truth. Conversely, if tax rates have remained stable or even decreased, the claim would be less accurate.

2. **Accuracy of the Data**: The data should accurately reflect crime rates over the specified period. This includes ensuring that the methodology used to collect and analyze the data is sound and consistent with accepted practices.

3. **Comparison with Previous Years**: The claim suggests a clear decrease in crime compared to previous years. This requires a comparison of the most recent data with data from previous years to confirm a downward trend.

2. **Monthly Budget Surpluses**: The claim states that there were surpluses at the end of every month this year. If this is accurate, it means that for each month, income exceeded expenses.

2. **Constitutionality**: The claim also asserts that being in pre-trial detention for more than 9 months is unconstitutional. This requires an understanding of the specific laws and constitution of the relevant jurisdiction (likely Georgia, given the context).

Without specific knowledge of the legal framework in Georgia, it is challenging to definitively state whether the duration is unconstitutional. However, many legal systems have provisions that limit the duration of pre-trial detention to prevent abuse and ensure fair trials.

Without specific details such as the source of the claim, the time frame, the region or country it applies to, and any supporting documentation, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, based on the information provided, here's a general approach to evaluating such a claim:

1. **Check the Source**: Is the claim made by a reliable and credible source, such as a government announcement, official report, or reputable news outlet?
2. **Verify the Details**: Look for specific details about the increase, including the effective date, the scope (e.g., all teachers or a specific group), and any conditions attached to the increase.
3. **Cross-Reference**: Compare the claim with other sources and reports to see if the information is consistent.

Without this additional context, the claim can't be fully validated. Therefore, based on the lack of sufficient information, the best we can do is classify the claim as follows:

**Final Answer: Half True**

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to the latest statistics, but generally, poverty trends can be influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, government policies, and global events.

For a precise evaluation, one would need to refer to recent reports from reliable sources such as the World Bank, national statistics agencies, or other reputable organizations that track poverty levels. If such data indicates a consistent increase in extreme poverty across all population categories in Georgia, then the claim would be supported.

However, without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. Based on general trends and the need for up-to-date information, the claim might be considered 'Half True' unless supported by comprehensive and recent data.

1. **Profit Tax**: This is a tax levied on the profits of a business. It can indeed be seen as a ""loss"" from the business's perspective.

2. **Government's Administrative Expenses**: These are the costs associated with running the government. They do not directly offset or reduce the profit tax for businesses.

3. **Excise Tax**: This is a tax levied on specific goods, such as alcohol or tobacco. It is generally passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Given these definitions, the claim seems to misinterpret how these elements interact:

- **Profit Tax** is a direct cost to businesses and is not reduced by administrative expenses or excise taxes.
- **Government's Administrative Expenses** are funded by various taxes, including profit tax, but they do not reduce the amount of profit tax businesses pay.
- **Excise Tax** is a separate tax and does not offset the profit tax.

Therefore, the statement is not accurate in its claim that the loss caused by the profit tax is reduced by the government's administrative expenses and the excise tax.

The claim states that in 2012, 11 million was spent, and today 19 million is spent.

Without specific data to verify the exact amounts, we can analyze the claim based on the information provided:

1. The claim specifies that spending increased from 11 million to 19 million.
2. This represents a significant increase in spending.

Given that the claim provides specific figures and asserts a clear increase, it is crucial to verify these figures with official records or reliable sources. However, since we do not have access to those sources here, we can only assess the claim based on the information given.

Without specific data at hand, I can provide a general approach to verify this claim:

1. **Check Official Health Statistics**: Look for reports from the CDC, the Georgia Department of Public Health, or other reputable health organizations.
2. **Review Tobacco-Related Mortality Data**: These organizations often publish annual reports on tobacco-related deaths, which can be used to verify the claim.
3. **Compare with National Data**: Compare Georgia's data with national averages to see if the figure aligns with broader trends.

Given the importance of accuracy in health statistics, if the figure of 11,400 annual deaths in Georgia from tobacco-related diseases is consistent with data from these sources, the claim would be considered accurate.

**Final Answer:** Without specific data, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

The World Bank's Doing Business report has undergone methodological changes over the years, which can indeed affect the ratings of countries. However, without specific data or evidence linking Georgia's rating deterioration directly to a change in methodology, it is difficult to fully substantiate the claim.

If there is evidence that the new methodology significantly altered the criteria or weighting that led to a drop in Georgia's rating, the claim could be considered mostly true.

2. **""Georgian Dream"" Coming to Power**: The ""Georgian Dream"" coalition won the parliamentary elections in October 2012. This is a widely documented event and can be verified through various news sources and official election results.

Given that the ""Georgian Dream"" indeed came to power in 2012, the second part of the claim is accurate. The first part, regarding the number of public sector employees, requires verification.

1. **""2 billion lari went down the drain""**: This implies a significant financial loss. Without detailed information on what the 2 billion lari were spent on and the outcomes, it's challenging to verify this part of the claim.

2. **""the growth rate of agriculture is decreasing""**: This part can be checked against reliable economic data. If official statistics show a decline in the agricultural growth rate, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Efficiency**: The claim mentions that the ministry's efficiency is over 100% based on 6 months of data. Efficiency in this context likely refers to the ministry's ability to achieve its goals or complete projects within the allocated budget and timeframe. An efficiency over 100% would typically imply that the ministry has exceeded its targets or completed more projects than planned with the available resources.

2. **Other Factors**: However, currency devaluation can also be influenced by many other factors, such as inflation rates, interest rates, political stability, economic growth, and investor sentiment.

2. **Location**: The cost of living can differ greatly between regions and countries. Without specifying the location, it is difficult to verify the claim.

3. **Data Sources**: Reliable data sources such as government statistics, economic reports, or reputable studies should be used to confirm the percentage increase in the cost of living.

Without these specific details, it is challenging to definitively label the claim as true or false. However, general economic trends and reports often show that cost of living increases are significant but typically vary and may not uniformly reach 40-50% over a short period.

Given the lack of specificity and the variation in economic data, the claim is likely exaggerated or not universally applicable. Therefore, a balanced assessment would be:

1. **True**: The president's veto power is indeed a constitutional mechanism that can influence what becomes law.
2. **Mostly True**: While the veto is a legitimate power, it can be seen as an interference in parliamentary affairs, particularly if used frequently or without clear justification.

In the European Union, public procurement is generally governed by strict rules to ensure transparency and fair competition. However, there are certain exemptions and specific rules for public broadcasters. For instance, the EU's public procurement directives (such as Directive 2014/24/EU) allow for exemptions for certain types of procurement by public broadcasters, particularly when it comes to programming and related services.

These exemptions are based on the unique nature of public broadcasters and their mission to provide public service content.

Without detailed information about the decisions made by the Mayor of Poti and their financial impact, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim.

However, for the sake of providing an answer based on the information given, we can consider the following:

- If there is credible evidence showing that the Mayor's decisions have indeed resulted in significant financial losses for the budget, the claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True.'
- If the evidence is mixed or inconclusive, the claim could be 'Half True.'
- If the evidence suggests that the Mayor's decisions have not caused such damage, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Given the lack of specific evidence in the statement, a cautious approach would be to classify it as 'Half True' until further information is provided.

- If the data shows that the salary has increased by exactly 20 million lari, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the data shows a significant increase close to 20 million lari, but not exactly 20 million, the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- If the data shows an increase but not close to 20 million lari, the claim would be 'Half True'.

Without access to that data, we cannot definitively answer the question. However, I can guide you on how to approach this:

1. **Define the Scope**: Determine the time frame and the specific budget being referred to (e.g., national budget, state budget, etc.).
2. **Gather Data**: Obtain historical data on budget revenues for the specified period.
3. **Analyze the Data**: Compare the current budget revenues with past data to see if they are indeed the highest ever recorded.

1. **Check Official Records**: Look at government budget reports or financial statements for 2012 and 2019 to see the allocated and actual spending on bureaucracy.
2. **Cross-reference Data**: Use multiple sources, such as government websites, official reports, and reputable news outlets, to verify the figures.
3. **Consider Inflation and Other Factors**: Ensure that the comparison takes into account factors like inflation, changes in the scope of bureaucratic functions, and any other relevant economic indicators.

If the data shows that the spending in 2019 was indeed 580 million lari more than in 2012, the claim would be 'True'. If the data is somewhat close but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True'.

Without specific data, this is challenging to confirm. However, if there is evidence or official records that support this claim, it would be considered true.

2. **Amount Spent**: The claim states that 400 thousand lari was spent on the renovations. This figure needs to be verified against official financial records or reports. If the amount aligns with the records, then this part of the claim is true.

Given the lack of specific verifiable information in the prompt, we can only make a general assessment based on typical scenarios:

- If there is confirmation that all kindergartens were renovated but the amount spent is slightly different, the claim could be 'Mostly True'.
- If only some kindergartens were renovated or the amount spent is significantly different, the claim could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

Eco-migrants often face challenges related to housing quality, infrastructure, and integration into new communities.

According to various economic reports and data from organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Georgia did experience notable economic growth during 2016-2017. However, whether this growth was among the highest globally or regionally is a matter of comparison with other countries and regions.

Georgia's economic growth rate in 2016 was around 2.7% and in 2017, it was around 5%. While this growth was significant, it was not necessarily among the highest in the world. Countries like Ethiopia, India, and China, among others, had higher growth rates during the same period.

1. ""Every seventh person buys food with borrowed money.""
2. ""Every third person is unemployed.""

These statements imply that:
- 1 out of 7 people buy food with borrowed money.
- 1 out of 3 people are unemployed.

Let's analyze the logical implications:

- If every seventh person buys food with borrowed money, this suggests that approximately 14.3% (1/7) of the population is in this situation.
- If every third person is unemployed, this suggests that approximately 33.3% (1/3) of the population is unemployed.

The claim does not provide any direct linkage or overlap between these two groups (those who buy food with borrowed money and those who are unemployed). Therefore, the statements are not mutually exclusive and could theoretically coexist without contradiction.

However, without additional context or data, it is challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. The claim does not contain an inherent logical contradiction, but it also does not provide enough information to verify its accuracy.

1. **Expenditure Increase**: The claim states that the expenditure part of the 2013 budget increased by 703 million lari. To verify this, we would need the expenditure figures for the previous year and the 2013 budget.

2. **Tax Revenue Increase**: The claim states that tax revenues increased by 633 million lari. To verify this, we would need the tax revenue figures for the previous year and the 2013 budget.

2. Whether the supplied water is not suitable for drinking.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, I will assume a hypothetical scenario based on common reporting standards:

- If water has indeed been supplied but is found to be contaminated or otherwise unfit for drinking, the claim would be mostly accurate.
- If there is some uncertainty or partial truth regarding either the supply or the quality of the water, the claim could be considered 'Half True'.

1. **Population and Energy Access**: Georgia is a country in the Caucasus region. While it is true that some rural areas may rely on wood for heating, claiming that half of the population does so is a significant assertion.

2. **Energy Infrastructure**: Georgia has been developing its energy infrastructure, including natural gas pipelines. The country imports natural gas from Azerbaijan and Russia, and while there are still regions with limited access, the claim that half of the population lacks gas seems exaggerated.

3. **Data and Reports**: According to various reports and studies, the percentage of the population relying solely on wood for heating is not as high as 50%. There are efforts to improve energy access, and while there are challenges, the situation is not as severe as the claim suggests.

However, changes in methodology can indeed affect rankings, but they are not always the sole reason for such changes.

- Georgia, like many countries, typically experiences a combination of births, deaths, immigration, and emigration that affects its population.

It is highly unlikely that every single crime, including minor offenses and those that go unreported, would be solved. Police departments typically have a clearance rate that is less than 100%, even in the most efficient jurisdictions.

Given the complexity of criminal investigations and the likelihood of unsolved cases, the claim that every crime was solved is almost certainly an exaggeration. Therefore, the most accurate categorization would be:

1. **Development Levels**: Georgia is generally considered a developing country. Countries more developed than Georgia would include most Western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and some East Asian countries like Japan and South Korea.

2. **Proportional Electoral Systems**: Countries with proportional electoral systems include many European nations like Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands, among others.

3. **Mixed Electoral Systems**: A mixed electoral system usually combines elements of proportional representation and majoritarian systems. Germany, for example, uses a mixed-member proportional system.

Given these points, let's examine the claim:

- Countries more developed than Georgia include many with proportional systems.
- Some of these countries, like Germany, indeed have mixed systems.
- However, not all countries that are more developed than Georgia and use proportional systems necessarily have mixed systems. Some might use purely proportional systems.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate because it suggests a universal rule that doesn't hold true in all cases.

1. **""Investments in Adjara increased 2.5 times""** - This suggests a significant increase in investment, but without specific data or sources, it's difficult to verify.
2. **""Tourism grew by 80%""** - Again, this is a substantial claim but lacks supporting data or context.
3. **""170 hotels were built in 4 years""** - This is a quantifiable claim, but it requires verification through reliable sources.
4. **""We will add 6 thousand...""** - This part of the claim is future-oriented and cannot be verified as true or false at present.

Without access to real-time data or specific context (e.g., country, time period), it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general trends and available information up to my knowledge cutoff in 2023, here's a general assessment:

In recent years, some countries have seen a decrease in the number of prisoners convicted for drug offenses due to various factors such as changes in sentencing policies, decriminalization efforts, and rehabilitation programs. However, the trend can vary significantly by region and specific time frame.

The claim suggests that no new jobs are being created and that existing jobs are being lost, implying a net loss of jobs and economic hardship for the population. This is a strong statement that would require substantial evidence to support.

In many economies, job creation and loss are dynamic processes, with some sectors creating jobs while others may be shedding them. Additionally, economic indicators such as unemployment rates, job growth reports, and GDP trends can provide a more nuanced picture.

Given the lack of specific data or context, the claim seems to be an overgeneralization. It is likely that some jobs are being created even if there are job losses in certain sectors. Therefore, the claim is likely exaggerated.

These factors include economic indicators, monetary policy, inflation rates, political stability, and trade balances, among others. While speculative behavior can certainly play a role, it is rarely the sole cause of exchange rate movements.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Speculative Behavior**: This can indeed influence exchange rates, especially in the short term, as traders buy and sell currencies based on expectations of future price movements.

2. **Economic Factors**: Economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment rates also significantly impact exchange rates.

3. **Monetary Policy**: Central bank policies, including interest rate changes and foreign exchange interventions, are crucial factors.

4. **Political Stability**: Political events and stability can affect investor confidence and thus influence exchange rates.

5. **Trade Balances**: A country's trade balance—the difference between exports and imports—can also affect the demand for its currency.

Given these multiple influences, attributing exchange rate movements solely to speculative behavior is an oversimplification.

Without access to detailed crime statistics or reports, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of this claim.

However, based on general knowledge and typical patterns of crime reporting, claims about specific numbers of crimes often require verification from official sources such as police reports, crime statistics databases, or news articles.

Georgia has indeed faced territorial disputes, particularly with regard to the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which are considered occupied territories by Georgia. The international community, including various international organizations, has expressed support for Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

Given the complexity and sensitivity of surveillance practices, it is challenging to definitively prove or disprove this claim without specific examples. However, it is widely known that many countries have strict regulations and national security measures in place to prevent foreign entities from having such control over their surveillance infrastructure.

That said, there have been instances where foreign companies have been involved in surveillance activities, though not necessarily ""owning the keys"" to them. For example, some countries may use technology or services provided by foreign companies, but the actual control over the surveillance mechanisms typically remains with the domestic government or security agencies.

2. **Economic Interdependence**: Currencies of neighboring countries can indeed influence each other due to trade, investment, and economic ties. If the currencies of Georgia's neighbors devalued, it could put pressure on the lari.

3. **Other Factors**: However, currency devaluation is also influenced by internal factors such as economic policy, inflation, and political stability. External factors alone do not fully explain a currency's devaluation.

Here's a breakdown of the claim:

1. **Publishing a list of disenfranchised voters**: This action itself may not necessarily be illegal if it is done in accordance with the law and does not reveal sensitive personal information.
2. **Including personal numbers**: Publishing personal numbers is typically a violation of privacy laws, as these numbers are considered sensitive personal information.

1. **Historical Context**: The Georgian Dream has generally supported Georgia's Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership, as a part of its foreign policy.
2. **Recent Statements**: There have been instances where Georgian Dream leaders have made statements that might be interpreted as de-emphasizing NATO membership as an immediate priority, focusing instead on other domestic or foreign policy issues.

The claim states that ""Parkingservice"" brought in 166 thousand lari instead of 460 thousand lari into the budget, and 60% of the revenue was achieved.

Let's break down the numbers:

1. Expected revenue: 460 thousand lari
2. Actual revenue: 166 thousand lari
3. Claimed percentage of expected revenue achieved: 60%

To verify the claim, we need to calculate what 60% of the expected revenue would be:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 460,000 \text{ lari} = 0.60 \times 460,000 = 276,000 \text{ lari} \]

However, the actual revenue was 166 thousand lari, which is significantly less than 276 thousand lari.

To determine the actual percentage of the expected revenue that was achieved:

\[ \frac{166,000}{460,000} \times 100\% \approx 36.09\% \]

This means the actual percentage achieved is approximately 36.09%, not 60%.

Given this discrepancy, the claim that 60% of the revenue was achieved is inaccurate.

Without specific data or reports, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if there is evidence of increased tax enforcement and a corresponding rise in tax revenues from the gaming industry, the claim would likely be true or mostly true.

Central banks often intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilize their currency, which can involve spending reserves. If official records from the central bank or financial reports confirm this expenditure, it would support the claim.

Without access to specific data or official reports, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if we assume that the figures provided are based on verifiable sources and are not grossly exaggerated or misrepresented, the claim could be considered mostly accurate.

1. **Identify the Source**: Check if the claim comes from an official report, a government statement, or a reputable news outlet.
2. **Verify the Numbers**: Look for official budget documents or project reports from the relevant government agencies for the years 2016, 2017, and 2018.

Georgia, as a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), is required to comply with international trade rules, which include provisions against dumping. Dumping refers to the practice of exporting goods at a price lower than the normal value, which can harm domestic industries in the importing country.

Georgia has adopted various trade-related laws to comply with WTO agreements. Specifically, Georgia's Law on Foreign Trade and Protection of Domestic Market includes provisions related to anti-dumping measures. These provisions allow Georgia to impose duties on imported goods that are found to be dumped, thereby protecting its domestic industries from unfair competition.

Given this context, the claim that anti-dumping legislation is in force in Georgia is accurate.

1. **Economic Impact**: Greece and Georgia are both part of the broader European and Eurasian economic landscape. Developments in Greece, such as economic crises or improvements, can have ripple effects on trade, investment, and tourism in Georgia.

2. **Political Impact**: Political stability or instability in Greece can influence regional politics. Georgia, as a neighboring country, might feel the effects through shifts in diplomatic relations, security concerns, or changes in regional alliances.

3. **Regional Influence**: Both countries are part of the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea region, which has strategic importance for trade routes, energy pipelines, and security. Developments in Greece could alter the regional dynamics, affecting Georgia indirectly.

4. **Cultural and Social Impact**: Changes in Greece might also influence cultural exchanges, migration patterns, and social dynamics in Georgia.

Given these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that developments in Greece will have some impact on Georgia, although the extent and nature of this impact can vary significantly. Therefore, the claim is mostly true.

Therefore, it is generally accepted that budget deficit spending can indeed affect the money supply.

3. **Share in the Economy**: The claim also mentions the share of agriculture in the economy, which is typically measured by its contribution to GDP. This share can change due to various factors, including growth in other sectors.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general economic principles:

- If there was significant investment in agriculture and it did not result in growth, this could be indicative of inefficiencies or other issues.
- The share of agriculture in the economy can decrease even if the sector grows, if other sectors grow at a faster rate.

1. **Number of Countries with Decriminalized Narcotics Possession:**
   - Portugal is well-known for decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of all drugs in 2001.
   - The Czech Republic has also decriminalized the possession of small amounts of certain drugs.
   - Other countries in Europe have varying degrees of decriminalization or different drug policies, such as the Netherlands with its tolerant approach to cannabis.

2. **Impact of Decriminalization:**
   - In Portugal, studies have shown mixed results. Some indicate a decrease in drug-related deaths and HIV infections, while others point to increased drug usage. The overall impact is debated, but many experts suggest that the situation has not necessarily ""worsened.""
   - In the Czech Republic, the impact is also debated, with some studies showing no significant worsening of the drug situation.

2. Football doesn't benefit at all from this spending.

Without specific data or sources to verify the exact amount spent annually on Georgian football or the outcomes of this spending, it's challenging to definitively confirm or deny the claim.

1. The statement about the annual spending of 40 million could be true, mostly true, or false depending on official budget reports and financial statements from the Georgian government and the Football Federation.

2. The claim that football doesn't benefit at all is subjective and would require a detailed analysis of the Football Federation's activities, the state of football infrastructure, player development programs, and other related factors.

Instead, the Sakrebulo usually approves the budget submitted by the executive body.

2. **Market Demand**: There must be sufficient demand in the Russian market for Georgian products to support doubling the exports.

Without specific data, it's impossible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, if we assume the claim is based on some reliable data source, we can analyze the statement logically.

If the claim states that agriculture significantly increased after 2013 and continuously decreased from 2004 to 2012, we need to consider the following:

1. **Significant Increase After 2013**: This suggests a notable upward trend in agricultural production or related metrics post-2013.
2. **Continuous Decrease from 2004 to 2012**: This suggests a consistent downward trend in agricultural production or related metrics during this period.

Given the lack of specific data, we can infer that if the statement accurately reflects the trends observed in agricultural data, it could be considered mostly true. If there were fluctuations or periods of stability within these timeframes, the claim might be less accurate.

1. **Visa Regulations and Tourism:**
   - Visa regulations can act as a barrier to travel, making it more difficult and expensive for potential tourists to visit a country. This can lead to a decrease in tourism.
   - Studies and case examples often show that stringent visa requirements can deter tourists, especially from countries where the visa process is complex or costly.

2. **Visa Regulations and Economic Problems:**
   - Tourism is a significant contributor to many economies. A decrease in tourism due to visa regulations can lead to economic problems, such as reduced revenue from tourism, job losses in the tourism sector, and lower overall economic activity.
   - The economic impact can be particularly pronounced in regions heavily reliant on tourism.

Given these points, the claim that the introduction of visa regulations is not linked to a decrease in tourism or economic problems is generally not supported by evidence. While other factors may also contribute to these outcomes, visa regulations can indeed have a negative impact.

3. **Official Statements:** Check if Irakli Garibashvili has made public statements regarding these improvements.

While defense budgets can vary significantly from country to country and year to year, it is generally true that a substantial portion of the defense budget is allocated to personnel costs, including salaries and benefits.

However, the claim that 80% of the defense budget is spent on salaries is likely an overestimation. Typically, defense budgets also include significant allocations for procurement (purchasing new equipment and weapons), research and development, operations and maintenance, and other expenses.

3. **Country with High Economic Growth**: This is a qualitative statement that can be subjective, but generally, growth rates above 5% are often considered high.

Given the information, the claim appears to be mostly accurate, but it lacks specific details that could fully validate it as entirely true.

A negative trade balance, also known as a trade deficit, occurs when a country's imports exceed its exports. A trade deficit of 50 percent would imply that the value of imports is 50 percent greater than the value of exports. This is an extremely high figure and is not typically observed in stable economies.

Historically, even countries with significant trade deficits do not reach such high levels. For example, the United States, which has one of the largest trade deficits, typically has a trade deficit in the range of 2-6 percent of GDP, not 50 percent.

Given the lack of precedent for such a high trade deficit in any major economy, the claim is likely exaggerated or incorrect.

When a currency like the lari devalues, it typically leads to increased costs for imported goods and services, which can affect budget expenditures, especially if the government has significant foreign currency-denominated debts or imports.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Imported Goods and Services**: If the government imports goods and services, the cost of these imports will increase, leading to higher expenditures.
2. **Foreign Debt**: If the government has foreign currency-denominated debt, the cost of servicing this debt will increase with the devaluation.
3. **Inflation**: Devaluation can lead to inflation, which can increase the cost of goods and services domestically, affecting budget expenditures.

In some jurisdictions, individuals may indeed be released based on procedural agreements, but this is not universally the case. Many factors, including the severity of the charge, prior criminal history, and the strength of the evidence, can influence the outcome.

2. **Policy Flexibility**: However, such a norm can also limit a government's ability to respond quickly to economic changes or crises. This lack of flexibility might be seen negatively by some investors who value a government's ability to act promptly in times of need.

While the UN does project a decline in Georgia's population due to factors such as low fertility rates and emigration, the precise figure of 1.17 million by 2050 should be cross-checked with the most recent UN reports. If the latest data from the UN aligns closely with this figure, the claim would be considered mostly true. If there is a significant discrepancy, it would be considered less accurate.

Given the general trend of population decline projected by the UN, but without the exact figure of 1.17 million being widely cited in recent reports, the claim is likely overstating or understating the projection slightly.

1. **Source of Information**: Is there a reliable source that substantiates this claim?
2. **Context and Evidence**: Are there specific examples or documents that show how the money was spent ineffectively?
3. **Magnitude of Inefficiency**: Is the claim of ""ineffectively"" spending over 730,000 lari backed by a clear definition of what constitutes ineffective spending?

Without additional context or evidence, it is difficult to definitively determine the truthfulness of this claim. However, based on the information provided, we can make an educated assessment:

- **True**: This would imply that there is irrefutable evidence that the municipality spent over 730,000 lari ineffectively.
- **Mostly True**: This would mean that while there is evidence of ineffective spending, the exact amount might not be precisely 730,000 lari, or there might be some minor discrepancies.
- **Half True**: This would suggest that there is some evidence of ineffective spending, but the details are not fully accurate or complete.
- **Mostly False**: This would imply that while there might be some truth to the claim, the overall statement is largely inaccurate.
- **False**: This would mean that there is no evidence to support the claim of ineffective spending.

1. **Global Trends in International Investments**: Historically, global FDI trends have fluctuated. However, recent data from sources like the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) indicate that global FDI has been impacted by various factors, including economic downturns and geopolitical issues. For example, global FDI flows declined significantly in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but started to recover in 2021.

2. **Trends in Georgia**: Georgia has seen varying levels of FDI over the years. According to some reports, Georgia has attracted increasing FDI in certain periods, particularly when compared to other countries in the region. However, these increases are often tied to specific economic policies, reforms, or regional investment trends.

Given these points, the claim that international investments are generally decreasing globally while increasing in Georgia is not entirely accurate. The global trend is more nuanced, with periods of decline and recovery, and Georgia's FDI trends are subject to various factors that may not always show a direct contrast to global trends.

1. **Reduction in Premiums:** This part of the claim asserts a factual reduction in premiums. Without verified data, we cannot confirm if this is true, but it is presented as a measurable fact.

2. **Family Member's Premium:** This part of the claim implies a contradiction in Ms. Irma's stance on the fairness of premiums based on her family member's actions. This is more of a logical or ethical argument rather than a purely factual one.
