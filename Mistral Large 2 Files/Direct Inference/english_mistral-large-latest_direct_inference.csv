"Says Andrew Gillum has a ""far left socialist platform.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim that Andrew Gillum has a ""far left socialist platform,"" we need to consider his stated policies and compare them to traditional definitions of socialism.

Andrew Gillum, who ran for Governor of Florida in 2018, advocated for policies such as Medicare for All, a higher minimum wage, and increased funding for education. While these policies are generally considered progressive or left-leaning, they do not necessarily constitute a ""far left socialist platform."" Socialism typically involves collective or government ownership of the means of production, which Gillum did not advocate for.

Gillum's policies are more aligned with progressive Democratic ideals rather than outright socialism. Therefore, labeling his platform as ""far left socialist"" is an exaggeration.

I don't do earmarks. I've never done one. I'm not going to do one.,true,en,"To accurately evaluate the claim, we need to know the context and the individual making the statement. Generally, a claim like ""I don't do earmarks. I've never done one. I'm not going to do one."" could be verified or refuted based on the person's known actions and history. Without specific context or evidence, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, if we assume the context involves a politician or public figure known for their stance on earmarks, and there is no evidence to contradict their claim, the statement could be considered true.

"Says Donald Trump’s proposed tax treatment of hedge fund managers ""makes the current loophole even worse.""",true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider Donald Trump's proposed tax treatment of hedge fund managers and compare it to the current loophole, often referred to as the ""carried interest loophole.""

1. **Current Loophole**: The carried interest loophole allows hedge fund managers to treat a significant portion of their income as capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Trump's Proposal**: During his presidency and campaigns, Donald Trump proposed various tax plans. One of his proposals was to eliminate the carried interest loophole, which would have meant taxing carried interest as ordinary income. However, the specifics of his proposals have varied, and not all have been implemented.

3. **Analysis**: If Trump's proposal aimed to eliminate the loophole, it would generally not make the loophole ""even worse."" However, if the proposal included provisions that introduced other favorable tax treatments or maintained favorable conditions for hedge fund managers, it could be seen as exacerbating the issue.

Without specific details on the proposal in question, it's challenging to definitively say whether it makes the loophole worse. However, based on the general intent to eliminate the loophole, the claim seems misleading.

"Says Senate Republicans are ""following a longstanding tradition of not filling vacancies on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year.""",false,en,"The claim that Senate Republicans are ""following a longstanding tradition of not filling vacancies on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year"" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that Senate Republicans cited this as a reason for not considering President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, in 2016, the notion of a ""longstanding tradition"" is disputed. Historically, Supreme Court vacancies have been filled in presidential election years on numerous occasions. For instance, Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed in 1988, a presidential election year. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

"The stimulus bill ""promised to keep unemployment under 8%.""",mostly false,en,"The claim that the stimulus bill ""promised to keep unemployment under 8%"" is often associated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. While the bill itself did not explicitly make such a promise, some projections and statements by the Obama administration suggested that the stimulus would help keep unemployment below 8%. However, these were economic forecasts rather than guarantees.

Given that the bill did not contain an explicit promise but that such projections were made, the claim is not entirely accurate but has some basis in projections. Therefore, the appropriate categorization would be:

"The labor market is weak because if you count the unemployed, underemployed, and those who’ve stopped looking for work, the unemployment rate ""actually went up last month to 13.5 percent.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the different measures of unemployment. The official unemployment rate, known as U-3, only counts people who are actively looking for work. However, there are broader measures of unemployment, such as U-6, which include the unemployed, underemployed (those working part-time for economic reasons), and marginally attached workers (those who have stopped looking for work but would like a job).

If the claim is that the U-6 rate went up to 13.5 percent, it is likely referring to a broader measure of unemployment that includes these additional groups. This rate can indeed be higher than the official unemployment rate and can go up even if the official rate goes down.

Without specific data for the month in question, we cannot definitively say if the 13.5 percent figure is accurate. However, the concept that including underemployed and those who have stopped looking for work can lead to a higher unemployment rate is generally correct.

"Says Hillary Clinton ""is the one that labeled African-American youth as ‘superpredators.’""",mostly true,en,"The claim that Hillary Clinton labeled African-American youth as 'superpredators' is often misunderstood and taken out of context. In a 1996 speech, Clinton used the term 'superpredators' to describe a subset of criminals, not specifically African-American youth. However, the term had been popularized by political scientist John Dilulio to describe a supposed new breed of violent youth, and it was later criticized for its racial undertones. Clinton has since apologized for using the term. Therefore, while she did use the term, it was not specifically aimed at African-American youth.

"Electric car sales in Georgia have dropped dramatically since a $5,000 tax credit was eliminated and a $200 annual registration fee was imposed July 1.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the impact of the changes in tax incentives and fees on electric car sales in Georgia.

1. **Tax Credit Elimination**: The $5,000 tax credit was a significant incentive for purchasing electric vehicles (EVs). Its elimination would likely reduce the attractiveness of buying an EV for many consumers.

2. **Annual Registration Fee**: The introduction of a $200 annual registration fee for electric vehicles adds a recurring cost that was not present before. This fee could further discourage potential buyers.

Given these changes, it is plausible that electric car sales in Georgia would decrease. However, without specific data on the extent of the drop, we cannot definitively say it was ""dramatic.""

"The party in the White House is responsible for ""a massive tax increase on the middle class.""",mostly false,en,"To accurately assess the claim that ""the party in the White House is responsible for 'a massive tax increase on the middle class,'"" we would need to consider specific policies, legislation, and economic impacts during the current administration. As of my last update in October 2023, there has been no definitive evidence or widely acknowledged policy that would classify as a ""massive tax increase on the middle class"" attributed to the current administration.

In recent years, various administrations have enacted tax reforms, but these have generally focused on tax cuts or adjustments rather than significant increases, particularly for the middle class. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, enacted under the previous administration, included tax cuts for many individuals and businesses.

Given the lack of clear evidence supporting a massive tax increase specifically targeting the middle class under the current administration, the claim appears to be exaggerated or unfounded.

"If we choose Obamacare expansion, 600,000 will lose eligibility for their subsidies, of which 257,000 would be forced into Medicaid.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the data provided. The statement suggests that if a certain policy decision is made (choosing Obamacare expansion), a specific number of people will lose their subsidies, and a subset of those will be forced into Medicaid.

Without additional context or specific data sources, it's challenging to definitively label the claim. However, such claims often involve complex policy implications and can be nuanced. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Subsidy Loss**: The claim that 600,000 people will lose eligibility for their subsidies is a specific and quantifiable statement. This would need to be backed by detailed analysis or data from a reputable source.

2. **Forced into Medicaid**: The claim that 257,000 of those would be forced into Medicaid is also specific. This would depend on the eligibility criteria for Medicaid and how the expansion affects those criteria.

Given the specific numbers and the potential for policy nuances, the claim could be partially true but might not capture the full complexity of the situation. Therefore, without additional context or data, the claim is likely **Half True**.

"Fifteen years ago, you couldn't even get a pizza delivered in that neighborhood.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Fifteen years ago, you couldn't even get a pizza delivered in that neighborhood,"" we would need specific information about the neighborhood in question. Without such context, it's impossible to accurately determine the truthfulness of the statement. Generally, the availability of pizza delivery services can vary greatly depending on the location and time period.

However, since we don't have the specific details needed to verify this claim, we must consider it in a general sense. Given the widespread availability of pizza delivery services in many areas over the past few decades, it's more likely that the claim is exaggerated or not entirely accurate for most urban and suburban areas.

"Says the reforms in state Issue 2 ""will save taxpayer dollars""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that the reforms in state Issue 2 ""will save taxpayer dollars,"" we would need to consider the specific details of the reforms, the reliability of the sources making the claim, and any available evidence or expert analysis. Without additional context or specific information about Issue 2, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I will outline a general approach to evaluating such a claim:

1. **Identify the Reforms**: Determine exactly what reforms are proposed in Issue 2.
2. **Expert Analysis**: Look for analyses from independent experts, economists, or fiscal policy analysts.
3. **Cost-Benefit Studies**: Check if there are any cost-benefit analyses or studies that have been conducted.
4. **Historical Precedent**: Consider if similar reforms in other states or jurisdictions have resulted in savings.
5. **Source Reliability**: Assess the credibility of the source making the claim.

Given the lack of specific information in the prompt, a balanced approach would be to consider the claim as 'Half True' until more definitive evidence is available.

Our welfare system now consumes 42 percent of our budget.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Our welfare system now consumes 42 percent of our budget,"" we need to consider the context and the specifics of the budget being referred to. Generally, welfare spending encompasses a variety of social safety net programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other assistance programs.

According to various sources, including the U.S. federal budget breakdowns, the total spending on social safety net programs (which could be broadly categorized under ""welfare"") typically accounts for a significant portion of the budget, but the exact percentage can vary. As of recent data, the combined spending on these programs is generally around 60% of the federal budget, with significant portions going to Social Security and Medicare.

However, the term ""welfare"" can be interpreted more narrowly to refer specifically to means-tested programs like TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), and others. In this narrower sense, the percentage of the budget allocated to these programs is much lower, typically around 10-15%.

Given this context, the claim that the welfare system consumes 42 percent of the budget is likely an overstatement if considering a narrow definition of welfare. If considering a broader definition, it might be closer to accurate but still not precise.

There has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of this great city.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we would need to review the historical records of elections in the city in question. Since I don't have access to real-time data or specific historical records, I can't definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to how you might assess such a claim:

1. **Research Historical Elections**: Look up the election results for mayoral races in the city.
2. **Identify Aldermen Candidates**: Check if any aldermen have run for the mayoral position.
3. **Compare Results**: Determine if any of these aldermen have defeated an incumbent mayor.

Without specific data, a general assessment based on typical political dynamics might suggest that incumbents often have an advantage due to name recognition and existing political networks. However, this is not a sufficient basis to confirm the claim as universally true or false.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim could be considered **Half True** as it might be accurate in many cases but could potentially be disproven with specific historical examples.

Says Charlie Crist could have expanded Medicaid after the health care law passed but didn't.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim that Charlie Crist could have expanded Medicaid after the health care law passed but didn't, it's crucial to understand the context and the historical timeline of events.

Charlie Crist served as the Governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as the health care law, was signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010. One of the key provisions of the ACA was the expansion of Medicaid, which would have allowed states to extend Medicaid coverage to more low-income individuals.

However, the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could choose whether or not to participate in the Medicaid expansion. This decision effectively made Medicaid expansion optional for states.

Charlie Crist was no longer the Governor of Florida by the time the Supreme Court ruling was made. Rick Scott, who succeeded Crist as Governor in 2011, was in office when the decision to expand Medicaid was up to the states. Therefore, while Crist was Governor during the passage of the ACA, he was not in a position to expand Medicaid after the Supreme Court ruling made it optional for states.

Given this context, the claim that Charlie Crist could have expanded Medicaid after the health care law passed but didn't is not entirely accurate because the decision point for states to expand Medicaid came after his tenure as Governor.

For example, a study published in the journal Criminology found that increases in the undocumented immigrant population are associated with decreases in violent crime.

However, it's important to note that crime rates can vary by specific locations and other factors. Therefore, while the claim is largely accurate, it's not universally true in every context.

Governor Scott Cut Taxes 40 Times For Florida Families,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Governor Scott Cut Taxes 40 Times For Florida Families,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of the tax cuts implemented by Governor Rick Scott during his tenure.

Governor Rick Scott, who served as the Governor of Florida from 2011 to 2019, did indeed implement numerous tax cuts during his time in office. The claim that he cut taxes 40 times is supported by various sources, including official records and statements from the governor's office. These tax cuts included reductions in property taxes, sales taxes, and business taxes, among others.

While the exact number and impact of these tax cuts can be debated, the overall assertion that Governor Scott implemented a significant number of tax cuts is generally accurate. However, the specific claim of ""40 times"" should be scrutinized for precision and context.

The claim suggests that the average number of mass shootings per year has tripled from about five (2000-2008) to fifteen (present).

According to various databases and research institutions that track mass shootings, such as the Gun Violence Archive, FBI reports, and academic studies, there has indeed been a significant increase in the frequency of mass shootings in the United States. While the exact numbers can vary depending on the definition of ""mass shooting"" used by different sources, the overall trend supports the claim that the number of such incidents has increased.

However, the specific numbers cited (about five per year from 2000 to 2008 and fifteen per year currently) may not be precise and can vary based on the methodology and definitions used. Nonetheless, the general trend of a substantial increase is consistent with available data.

Therefore, while the claim may not be perfectly accurate in terms of the exact numbers, it captures the essence of the trend correctly.

Without specific data at hand, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we were to rely on general trends and available public data, we can make an educated assessment.

1. **Data Collection**: Organizations like the Washington Post's ""Fatal Force"" database and the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program provide data on police use of deadly force. These sources can be used to compare rates across different cities.

2. **Comparison**: If Milwaukee's rate of police use of deadly force is indeed lower than most other major cities, this claim would be supported.

3. **Context**: The context of the claim is important. ""Among the lowest"" implies a comparison with a significant number of other cities, not just a few.

Given the general lack of specific data in this response, we can reasonably infer that without clear evidence to the contrary, the claim might be partially true but not definitively so without further data.

Without additional context or verification from reliable sources, it is challenging to definitively determine the accuracy of these numbers. However, the claim implies that a very small portion of the total jobs created are direct jobs in the auto industry, which could be a point of contention or clarification.

Marco Rubio has proposed various measures aimed at making college more affordable, including income-share agreements and greater flexibility in accreditation. These proposals could, in theory, benefit for-profit colleges by making it easier for them to receive federal funding and by providing alternative financing options for students.

However, the claim suggests that the overhaul is specifically designed to benefit for-profit colleges, which may not be entirely accurate. Rubio's proposals are aimed at addressing broader issues of college affordability and accessibility, and while they could incidentally benefit for-profit colleges, they are not exclusively targeted at this sector.

Historically, large-scale troop withdrawals have indeed taken significant time. For example, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 took several months and involved complex logistics, including the movement of personnel, equipment, and supplies. The scale of the operation mentioned in the claim (160,000 troops) is substantial, and such a withdrawal would require extensive planning and execution.

- A month with 31 days can have a fifth Wednesday.
- February, with 28 or 29 days, cannot have a fifth Wednesday.

Let's check the months in 2016:

"Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker ""slashed"" pensions and benefits for public employees.",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker ""slashed"" pensions and benefits for public employees, we need to examine the specific actions taken by Walker during his time as governor.

Gov. Scott Walker implemented significant changes to public employee benefits through Act 10, which was passed in 2011. This legislation required public employees to contribute more to their health insurance and pension plans. Specifically, it mandated that public employees pay at least 12.6% of their health insurance premiums and contribute 5.8% of their salary to their pension.

These changes effectively reduced the benefits package for public employees by increasing their out-of-pocket costs for health insurance and pensions. However, the term ""slashed"" might imply a more dramatic or sudden reduction than what actually occurred. The changes were substantial but were implemented as part of a broader effort to address budget issues and reduce the state's financial obligations.

Given the significant impact on public employee benefits, the claim that Gov. Scott Walker ""slashed"" pensions and benefits for public employees is largely accurate, though the term ""slashed"" may be seen as somewhat hyperbolic.

There are various factors that could contribute to a city being labeled as toxic, including air quality, water quality, hazardous waste, and industrial pollution.

According to several environmental reports and rankings, Houston often appears high on lists of polluted cities due to its significant industrial activity, particularly related to the oil and gas industry. However, the specific ranking as the ""third-most toxic"" can vary depending on the study and the year.

For instance, some reports might rank Houston higher or lower based on different metrics and time frames. Without a specific, recent, and widely recognized study that places Houston exactly as the third-most toxic city, it is difficult to confirm the claim as entirely true.

Given this context, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not definitively proven. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

"Between 2000 and 2006, ""health insurance company profits quadrupled.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""between 2000 and 2006, health insurance company profits quadrupled,"" we need to examine financial data from health insurance companies during this period.

1. **Data Collection**: Gather financial reports from major health insurance companies for the years 2000 to 2006. This can include companies like Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, Cigna, and others.

2. **Analysis of Profits**: Compare the profits reported by these companies in 2000 with those reported in 2006.

3. **Verification**: Check if the profits in 2006 are approximately four times the profits in 2000.

Without specific data, we can rely on historical reports and analyses. According to various sources, health insurance companies did experience significant profit growth during this period. For example:

- Aetna's net income grew from around $500 million in 2000 to over $1.8 billion in 2006.
- UnitedHealth Group's net income increased from approximately $1.2 billion in 2000 to over $3.6 billion in 2006.

These figures indicate substantial growth, but whether they quadrupled across the industry requires more comprehensive data.

**Conclusion**: Based on available data, the claim that ""health insurance company profits quadrupled"" between 2000 and 2006 is mostly supported but may not be entirely accurate for all companies. Therefore, the most accurate categorization would be:

However, this does not mean that the FBI categorically stated they ""cannot vet"" refugees, as the vetting process involves multiple agencies and layers of security checks.

Given the nuanced nature of the statement and the context provided by Comey's comments, the claim can be considered 'Half True'.

"In 2006, Arizona had four ballot issues that were ""very tough on illegal immigration... Forty-seven percent of the Hispanics in Arizona voted for them.""",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the facts surrounding the 2006 Arizona ballot issues related to immigration and the voting patterns of Hispanics.

In 2006, Arizona did have several ballot propositions that were tough on illegal immigration. These propositions included:

1. Proposition 100: Denial of bail to undocumented immigrants charged with serious felonies.
2. Proposition 102: Denial of punitive damages to undocumented immigrants in lawsuits.
3. Proposition 103: Making English the official language of Arizona.
4. Proposition 300: Denial of in-state tuition and financial aid to undocumented immigrants.

The claim suggests that 47% of Hispanics in Arizona voted for these propositions. While it is true that these propositions were on the ballot and were considered tough on illegal immigration, the specific statistic of 47% of Hispanics voting for them is more complex to verify without detailed voting data that breaks down by ethnicity.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm the exact percentage, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not fully verifiable. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true.

While there are some specific exemptions and unique situations, the claim oversimplifies and misrepresents the facts. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Congress**: Members of Congress and their staff are required to purchase health insurance through the exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but they receive employer contributions to help pay for their coverage, similar to other federal employees. They are not exempt from the law.

2. **Criminals**: Incarcerated individuals are generally not eligible for Medicaid or subsidies under Obamacare while they are in prison, but this is not an exemption unique to Obamacare; it's a standard practice related to government-funded healthcare programs. Upon release, they can enroll in health insurance.

3. **Scientologists**: There is no specific exemption for Scientologists or any other religious group from Obamacare. However, some religious groups may qualify for exemptions from the individual mandate based on religious beliefs, but this is not unique to Scientologists.

1. **Context**: Did The Washington Times provide data or examples to support this claim?
2. **Comparison**: How do the spending cuts of the current administration compare to those of previous administrations?
3. **Expert Analysis**: Have other reputable sources or experts corroborated this claim?

1. The speaker's belief in a carbon tax and aggressive climate change policies is a personal stance and cannot be fact-checked as true or false. It's a statement of opinion.

2. The claim about Hillary Clinton's position is more factually verifiable. Hillary Clinton has publicly supported action on climate change but has not explicitly endorsed a carbon tax. Instead, she has favored other market-based solutions and regulations.

In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated. We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to – or to the consulate, rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons, weapons that as you know in – in the wake of the revolution in Libya are – are quite common and accessible. And it then evolved from there.""

In her statement, Rice did mention the involvement of extremists but did not specifically mention al-Qaida or its affiliates. Instead, she referred to ""individual clusters of extremists.""

"Says that as Wisconsin governor he ""never raised taxes.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim that as Wisconsin governor, he ""never raised taxes,"" we need to examine the governor's record on tax policy during his tenure.

1. **Tax Cuts**: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who served from 2011 to 2019, is known for implementing significant tax cuts, including income and property tax reductions. These actions support the claim that he did not raise taxes.

2. **Fees and Other Revenue**: However, it is important to consider other forms of revenue increases, such as fees. For example, Governor Walker proposed increases in certain fees, like those for state parks. These increases, while not technically ""taxes,"" could be seen as a form of revenue generation that impacts citizens similarly to a tax.

3. **Gas Tax Proposal**: There were proposals during his tenure to raise the gas tax, although these were not implemented under his administration. The mere proposal of such increases could be seen as an attempt to raise taxes, even if it did not ultimately happen.

Given these points, the claim that he ""never raised taxes"" is not entirely accurate due to the proposed fee increases and the consideration of other revenue-generating measures. However, the significant tax cuts implemented during his tenure do support the overall spirit of the claim.

"Arizona is spending ""less on a per-capita basis than every single state in this country in higher education.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that Arizona is spending ""less on a per-capita basis than every single state in this country in higher education,"" we need to look at data on state spending on higher education per capita.

According to various sources such as the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association (SHEEO) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), states are ranked based on their per-capita spending on higher education. As of recent data, Arizona has consistently ranked low in per-capita spending on higher education.

However, claiming that Arizona spends less than ""every single state"" is a strong assertion. While Arizona is indeed among the lowest, there can be slight variations year-to-year and depending on the specific dataset used. Without the most current and exact figures, it is difficult to assert with absolute certainty that Arizona is the very lowest.

Given the available data and typical rankings, it is likely that Arizona is among the lowest, but not definitively the lowest every year. Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate but may not be entirely precise.

"Says Gina Raimondo's ""venture capital firm secured a secret no-bid contract funded by taxpayers.""",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Says Gina Raimondo's 'venture capital firm secured a secret no-bid contract funded by taxpayers,'"" we need to consider the available evidence and context surrounding Gina Raimondo and her involvement with venture capital firms.

Gina Raimondo was a co-founder of Point Judith Capital, a venture capital firm, before entering politics. During her tenure as Governor of Rhode Island, she was involved in various economic development initiatives, including the Rhode Island Innovation Institute.

The claim suggests that her venture capital firm secured a secret no-bid contract funded by taxpayers. To determine the accuracy of this claim, we would need to look at specific details such as:

1. Whether Point Judith Capital actually secured a contract with the state or any government entity.
2. Whether the contract was awarded through a no-bid process.
3. Whether the contract was funded by taxpayers.
4. Whether the contract was kept secret.

Without specific evidence pointing to a secret no-bid contract funded by taxpayers, the claim lacks substantiation. While there have been controversies surrounding Raimondo's economic policies, no widely reported or verified evidence supports the specific claim about a secret no-bid contract.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to support the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is not entirely accurate.

"If you're earning under $100,000 a year and you commute to New York every day you pay more to the Port Authority in tolls than you pay to the state of New Jersey in income tax.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the annual cost of tolls for commuting to New York City with the annual New Jersey state income tax for someone earning under $100,000.

1. **Port Authority Tolls:**
   - As of the latest information, the toll for crossing bridges and tunnels managed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey can vary, but let's assume a typical round-trip toll cost. For example, the cash toll for the George Washington Bridge is $16 per trip. If a commuter uses E-ZPass, the toll might be lower, around $12.50 per trip.
   - Assuming 250 workdays a year (5 days a week for 50 weeks), the annual cost of tolls would be:
     - With cash: $16 * 2 trips/day * 250 days/year = $8,000/year
     - With E-ZPass: $12.50 * 2 trips/day * 250 days/year = $6,250/year

2. **New Jersey State Income Tax:**
   - New Jersey has a progressive income tax system. For an individual earning under $100,000, the tax rate ranges from 1.4% to 5.525%.
   - For simplicity, let's consider an income of $75,000, which falls into the 5.525% tax bracket.
   - The annual state income tax would be approximately: $75,000 * 5.525% = $4,143.75

Comparing the annual toll cost to the annual state income tax:
- Tolls with cash: $8,000/year
- Tolls with E-ZPass: $6,250/year
- State income tax: $4,143.75/year

It is clear that the toll costs are higher than the state income tax for someone earning under $100,000 and commuting daily to New York.

When you look at 'all the money state and local governments bring in' from residents, 'we're more in the middle,'"" we need to consider the state's overall tax burden relative to other states.

Wisconsin's tax burden can be assessed using various metrics, such as per capita tax collections, tax revenue as a percentage of personal income, and specific tax rates (e.g., property taxes, sales taxes, income taxes).

According to recent data from sources like the Tax Foundation and the U.S. Census Bureau:
- Wisconsin's overall tax burden is generally considered to be around the median when compared to other states.
- The state ranks in the middle range for various tax categories, neither at the very top nor the very bottom.

2. **Data Collection:** Gather monthly unemployment rates for Georgia and the United States from a reliable source such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
3. **Comparison:** Compare the unemployment rates for each month within the identified period.
4. **Analysis:** Count the number of months where Georgia's unemployment rate exceeded the national rate.

Without access to specific data, I can provide a general framework for assessing the claim:

- If Georgia's unemployment rate was higher than the national rate for all 50 months, the claim is 'True.'
- If Georgia's unemployment rate was higher for most but not all of the 50 months, the claim is 'Mostly True.'
- If Georgia's unemployment rate was higher for roughly half of the months, the claim is 'Half True.'
- If Georgia's unemployment rate was higher for a minority of the months, the claim is 'Mostly False.'
- If Georgia's unemployment rate was not higher for any of the months, the claim is 'False.'

"Freshman Rep. Bob Gibbs ""is spending his one year anniversary on vacation — only working 6 days in all of January.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Vacation during the anniversary**: Whether Rep. Bob Gibbs is indeed on vacation during his one-year anniversary.
2. **Working days in January**: Whether he worked only 6 days in January.

Without specific evidence or data to confirm these points, we can't definitively say whether the claim is entirely true or false. However, it's important to note that representatives often have schedules that include both work in their district and in Washington, D.C., and ""vacation"" might not accurately describe all time spent away from Capitol Hill.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim seems to make a strong assertion without sufficient context or evidence. Therefore, the claim is likely not entirely accurate but may contain some elements of truth.

This rating was not the lowest among presidents at the end of their first year. For instance, President Trump had an approval rating of around 38% at the end of his first year, which is lower than Obama's.

Given this information, the claim that President Obama had the worst ratings of any president at the end of his first year is inaccurate.

"Hospitals have already begun layoffs, a direct result of Republican inaction on Medicaid expansion.",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Hospitals have already begun layoffs, a direct result of Republican inaction on Medicaid expansion,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Evidence of Layoffs**: Are there documented cases of hospitals laying off staff?
2. **Causal Link to Medicaid Expansion**: Is there a direct link between these layoffs and the lack of Medicaid expansion?
3. **Role of Republican Inaction**: Is the lack of Medicaid expansion specifically due to Republican inaction?

Without specific data or reports, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, based on general knowledge and trends:

1. **Layoffs**: There have been reports of hospitals facing financial difficulties and laying off staff, particularly during times of economic stress or changes in healthcare policy.
2. **Medicaid Expansion**: The expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act has been a contentious issue, with some states opting not to expand coverage, often due to political opposition.
3. **Causal Link**: While it is plausible that the lack of Medicaid expansion could contribute to financial strain on hospitals, it is not the sole factor. Other issues such as declining reimbursement rates, changes in healthcare regulations, and broader economic conditions also play a role.

Given these points, the claim that layoffs are a direct result of Republican inaction on Medicaid expansion oversimplifies a complex issue and attributes all causality to a single factor, which is not entirely accurate.

"There are fewer wars, there are fewer people dying in wars ""now than there have been in quite some time.""",mostly true,en,"The claim that ""There are fewer wars, there are fewer people dying in wars 'now than there have been in quite some time.'"" is generally supported by data from various sources, including the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP). While there are still ongoing conflicts and the nature of warfare has changed, the overall number of armed conflicts and battle-related deaths has been declining since the end of the Cold War and particularly since the peak in the mid-1990s.

However, it's important to note that:
- The claim does not specify a exact time frame for ""quite some time,"" which could lead to different interpretations.
- While the overall trend shows a decrease, there are still significant conflicts and fluctuations in the number of battle-related deaths from year to year.

"Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar,"" we need to consider the rate of solar installations in the United States.

As of recent data, the rate of solar installations in the U.S. has been increasing significantly. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the U.S. has seen a rapid growth in solar installations, with millions of homes and businesses now utilizing solar power.

While the specific claim of ""every four minutes"" may not be an exact figure, it is indicative of the rapid pace of solar adoption. Given the substantial growth in the solar industry and the increasing number of installations, the claim is likely rooted in factual trends, even if it may not be precisely accurate down to the minute.

Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly true, reflecting the rapid expansion of solar power in the United States.

Some studies suggest that certain gun laws can reduce violent crime, while others find no significant correlation or even an increase in crime.

Given the complexity of the issue and the lack of specific data to support the exact claim of a 23 percent reduction, it is likely that this claim is not entirely accurate or may be oversimplifying the issue. Therefore, the claim could be considered:

1. The claim states that a gas tax holiday would save 30 cents a day.
2. Over three months (approximately 90 days), the total savings would be \( 30 \text{ cents/day} \times 90 \text{ days} \).

Calculating the total savings:
\[ 30 \text{ cents/day} \times 90 \text{ days} = 2700 \text{ cents} \]

Converting cents to dollars:
\[ 2700 \text{ cents} = 27 \text{ dollars} \]

The claim states a total of $28, but the calculation shows $27. This is close but not exact.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but is close to the calculated value.

"Recommendations for a major tax overhaul for Georgia are an ""overall tax hike.""",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Recommendations for a major tax overhaul for Georgia are an 'overall tax hike,'"" we need to consider the details and context of the proposed tax changes. Without specific information about the recommendations, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, generally, tax overhauls can include a mix of tax increases and decreases, targeting different segments of the population and economy.

If the recommendations indeed propose a net increase in the overall tax burden for the majority of taxpayers or for the state as a whole, then the claim could be considered true or mostly true. Conversely, if the overhaul aims to be revenue-neutral or even result in a net decrease in taxes for most taxpayers, the claim would be false or mostly false.

Given the lack of specific details about the recommendations, a balanced approach would be to consider the claim as needing more context to be fully accurate. Therefore, the claim could be seen as potentially misleading without further information.

"As executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia there were ""300 people on my payroll in 2008.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the role and typical responsibilities of an executive director of a state political party, such as the Democratic Party of Virginia.

The executive director of a state political party typically oversees the day-to-day operations, including staff management, fundraising, and coordinating campaigns. However, having 300 people on the payroll directly under the executive director in 2008 seems unusually high for a state-level political party.

State political parties usually have a more modest staff size, often in the range of dozens rather than hundreds. Additionally, in 2008, which was an election year, there might have been an increase in staff due to campaign activities, but 300 people still seems exceptionally high.

Given the typical structure and staffing levels of state political parties, it is unlikely that the executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia had 300 people on their payroll in 2008. Therefore, the claim is likely an exaggeration or incorrect.

Scott Walker, who served as Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019, implemented significant changes to the state's education budget. One of the most notable actions was the 2011-2013 biennial budget, which included substantial cuts to K-12 education funding. This budget reduced state aid to schools by approximately $792 million, which was a significant reduction compared to previous years.

However, it is important to note that while these cuts were large, they were not necessarily the ""biggest"" in the state's history in terms of percentage or impact. The claim does not account for other historical contexts or adjustments for inflation and population growth.

### Data Analysis:
1. **Gun-Related Deaths Since 1968:**
   - According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other sources, the number of gun-related deaths in the U.S. since 1968 can be estimated by summing annual figures. As of recent data, this number exceeds 1.5 million deaths.

2. **American War Casualties:**

The combined number of these casualties is approximately 1.3 million.

### Comparison:
- **Gun-Related Deaths:** Over 1.5 million since 1968.
- **War Casualties:** Approximately 1.3 million in total.

Based on these figures, the claim that more Americans have died from gunfire since 1968 than in all the wars of the country's history appears to be accurate.

2. **Verification**: Without access to specific budget documents or reports, we cannot perform a direct verification. However, we can consider the plausibility based on typical budget figures and trends.

3. **Plausibility Check**: If the total government budget was around $70 billion, a 10 percent reduction would indeed be $7 billion. This is a plausible scenario, but it requires confirmation from official sources.

4. **Fact-Checking Standards**: In the absence of direct evidence, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is entirely true or false. However, the provided details make it reasonable to assume that there may be some truth to the claim, but further verification is needed.

Given these considerations, the claim can be preliminarily classified as 'Half True' until further evidence is provided.

However, generally speaking, claims about taxes being lower for the average middle-class family can be complex and depend on various factors such as changes in tax brackets, deductions, credits, and other economic policies.

In the mid-20th century, homicide rates in many U.S. cities, including Milwaukee, were generally lower than they are today. However, the claim that an average of 4 homicides per year would be a ""record number"" is likely an exaggeration. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, homicide numbers were typically higher than that in most cities.

However, this figure can vary by state and by the specific methodology used to calculate the wage gap.

In Texas, the gender wage gap has been reported to be similar to the national average, but it can fluctuate slightly. As of recent data, the figure of 82 cents to the dollar is a commonly cited statistic that aligns with broader national trends.

Therefore, based on available data and reports, the claim can be considered accurate within the context of general wage gap statistics.

Without access to specific data sources or reports that provide this information, it's not possible to definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim.

However, based on general knowledge and trends in stadium financing, it is common for a significant portion of the funding for such projects to come from public sources. Whether the figure is precisely 47% is harder to verify without specific data.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact percentage, the claim could be considered 'Half True' as it aligns with general trends but cannot be confirmed with precision.

Since I don't have real-time access to specific newspaper articles or endorsements, I'll provide a framework for how one might evaluate this claim.

1. **Identify Major Newspapers in Texas**: These might include The Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle, San Antonio Express-News, Austin American-Statesman, and others.

2. **Review Editorial Content**: Check the editorial sections and endorsements of these newspapers to see how they have characterized David Dewhurst.

3. **Consistency of Characterization**: Determine if each of these newspapers consistently refers to Dewhurst as a ""moderate.""

Given that this is a hypothetical evaluation, and assuming a thorough review of the major newspapers' content, if even one major newspaper does not refer to Dewhurst as a moderate, the claim would not hold as ""True."" If most but not all newspapers do, it might be considered ""Mostly True."" If there is significant variation, it might be ""Half True"" or even ""Mostly False"" if only a few do.

1. **Context of the Stimulus Program**: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) was passed in 2009 to stimulate the economy during the Great Recession.

2. **Job Numbers**: The claim states a specific decrease in jobs by July 2011. To validate this, we would need to look at employment data from reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

3. **Economic Conditions**: The effectiveness of the stimulus program should also consider the broader economic context, including whether the program prevented a more severe economic downturn.

Without specific data from July 2011, it's challenging to confirm the exact number of job losses. However, numerous economic analyses have shown that the stimulus program did help mitigate job losses and contributed to economic recovery.

Given the complexity of economic data and the potential for misinterpretation, the claim that the stimulus program was ineffective based solely on a job loss figure is likely an oversimplification. It does not account for the broader economic impact and the counterfactual scenario of what might have happened without the stimulus.

1. **Historical Context**: State spending typically fluctuates with economic conditions, policy changes, and the need for public services. A claim that state spending was cut in real terms for the first time in 150 years is a strong assertion that would require robust historical data to support.

2. **Economic Conditions in 2009**: The year 2009 was marked by the global financial crisis, which led to significant budget cuts in many countries. It is plausible that state spending was reduced in real terms during this period due to economic constraints.

3. **Real Terms**: ""Real terms"" refers to adjusting for inflation. To verify the claim, one would need to examine inflation-adjusted state spending data over the past 150 years.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data, a thorough fact-check would require access to detailed historical spending records adjusted for inflation. Without such data, a definitive conclusion cannot be made. However, the claim suggests a level of precision that is challenging to verify without extensive research.

"There is ""a constitutional issue"" that affects ""the paychecks of members of Congress"" during a shutdown.",true,en,"The claim that there is ""a constitutional issue"" affecting ""the paychecks of members of Congress"" during a shutdown is complex and requires context. The 27th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1992, prohibits any law that varies the compensation of members of Congress from taking effect until after the next election of Representatives. This means that Congress cannot give itself an immediate pay raise or cut. However, during a government shutdown, the paychecks of members of Congress can be affected as the funding for their salaries may be interrupted. This does not violate the Constitution per se, but it does highlight a constitutional consideration regarding their pay. Therefore, while there is a constitutional dimension to the discussion of Congressional pay, it is not a straightforward ""constitutional issue"" that would prevent or mandate the halting of paychecks during a shutdown.

Senator Jeff Plale saved my job -- and some 300 others at Bucyrus International.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Senator Jeff Plale saved my job -- and some 300 others at Bucyrus International,"" we need context and specific details about Senator Jeff Plale's actions and their impact on Bucyrus International. Without additional information, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, I can provide a framework for how this claim might be evaluated:

1. **True**: If there is clear and verifiable evidence that Senator Jeff Plale took specific actions that directly resulted in saving 300 jobs at Bucyrus International.
2. **Mostly True**: If the actions taken by Senator Jeff Plale significantly contributed to saving a large number of jobs at Bucyrus International, but the exact number or the direct impact might be slightly exaggerated or not fully substantiated.
3. **Half True**: If Senator Jeff Plale took some actions that had a positive impact on job retention at Bucyrus International, but the claim overstates the impact or the number of jobs saved.
4. **Mostly False**: If the actions taken by Senator Jeff Plale had minimal impact on job retention at Bucyrus International, or if the claim greatly exaggerates the number of jobs saved.
5. **False**: If there is no evidence that Senator Jeff Plale took any actions that saved jobs at Bucyrus International.

Without specific evidence, it is not possible to determine the exact truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the general framework:

**Final Answer: Half True**

The GOP health care proposal would slash more than $135 million in federal funding available to PA schools.,false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""The GOP health care proposal would slash more than $135 million in federal funding available to PA schools,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Is the claim based on a reputable source or analysis?
2. **Specific Details**: Does the claim specify which GOP health care proposal it refers to, and does it provide details about how the funding for schools would be affected?
3. **Factual Basis**: Is there data or analysis that supports the $135 million figure?

Without specific details or a credible source, it's challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, if we assume the claim is based on a reputable analysis or widely accepted report, we can consider it as follows:

- If the claim is backed by a detailed analysis from a reputable source that outlines how a specific GOP health care proposal would lead to a $135 million cut in federal funding for PA schools, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True.'
- If the claim is based on partial information or speculative analysis, it might be considered 'Half True.'
- If the claim lacks substantial evidence or is based on misinterpreted data, it could be considered 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Given the lack of specific details provided in the claim and the need for further context and data, a cautious evaluation would be:

"Says a 9-year-old girl was recently raped in Austin, Texas, by a guy previously ""caught four times and released.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the following points:
1. A 9-year-old girl was recently raped in Austin, Texas.
2. The perpetrator was previously caught four times and released.

Without specific details or sources to corroborate these points, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of the claim. Generally, such claims should be verified through credible news sources, police reports, or official statements.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided, the claim cannot be confirmed as entirely true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Half True.",half true,True,False
"Over 10 years, (extending tax cuts for the wealthy) would add less to the deficit than Obama added with the stimulus in one year.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the cost of extending tax cuts for the wealthy over 10 years with the cost of the Obama stimulus package in one year.

1. **Obama Stimulus Package (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009)**: The estimated cost of the stimulus package was approximately $831 billion over the 2009-2019 period, with a significant portion spent in the first few years.

2. **Extending Tax Cuts for the Wealthy**: The tax cuts in question are typically the Bush-era tax cuts. Extending these tax cuts for the wealthy was estimated to cost about $700 billion over 10 years, according to various analyses, including those by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

Given these figures:
- The Obama stimulus package added about $831 billion to the deficit, primarily in the first few years.
- Extending tax cuts for the wealthy would add about $700 billion to the deficit over 10 years.

While the cost of extending tax cuts for the wealthy over 10 years is indeed less than the total cost of the Obama stimulus package, the stimulus package's spending was concentrated in the early years, making a direct year-to-year comparison less straightforward.

Gun legislation is a complex and evolving area, but such a specific and restrictive measure would likely attract significant attention and debate.

Without more context or a direct reference to a specific bill, it is difficult to verify the claim. However, given the lack of widespread reporting or public awareness of such a provision, it is likely that the claim is either 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

The bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon — other than these drug gangs taking on one another — end up being shot with their own weapon.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider available data and research on gun violence. While it's true that a significant number of gun-related injuries and deaths involve the victim's own weapon, such as in cases of suicide or accidental shootings, the claim that the ""bulk"" of people who are shot are shot with their own weapon is an overstatement. Many shootings involve a separate perpetrator using their own weapon, including incidents of domestic violence, robberies, and mass shootings.

According to studies, a substantial portion of gun violence involves a weapon owned by someone other than the victim. Therefore, while there is some truth to the claim, it is not accurate to say that the ""bulk"" of shootings involve the victim's own weapon.

"Right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years,"" we need to refer to recent data on U.S. oil production.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. crude oil production has been increasing steadily over the past decade. As of recent reports, U.S. oil production has indeed reached levels not seen in many years, including surpassing historical highs from the past eight years.

Given this information, the claim is accurate based on the available data.

"More than 10 years of free trade ""has brought a $2 billion per day trade deficit.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context of ""more than 10 years of free trade"" and the resulting ""$2 billion per day trade deficit."" The claim is likely referring to the impact of free trade agreements, such as NAFTA, on the U.S. trade balance.

1. **Context of Free Trade Agreements**: Free trade agreements like NAFTA have been in place for over 25 years. The impact on trade deficits is complex and influenced by numerous factors, including global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and domestic policies.

2. **Trade Deficit Data**: The U.S. has indeed run significant trade deficits, but the magnitude and attribution to free trade agreements can vary widely. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. trade deficit has fluctuated over the years but has often been substantial.

3. **Daily Trade Deficit**: Calculating the daily trade deficit involves dividing the annual deficit by the number of days in a year. Historical data shows that the U.S. trade deficit has sometimes exceeded $2 billion per day, but this is not a consistent figure and can vary significantly year to year.

Given these points, the claim that ""more than 10 years of free trade 'has brought a $2 billion per day trade deficit'"" is oversimplified and not universally accurate. While there have been periods where the daily trade deficit reached or exceeded $2 billion, this is not a consistent outcome solely attributable to free trade agreements.

Scott Walker and a dozen members of his administration talk about jobs and the economy at Lambeau Field"" is not specific enough to determine its complete accuracy without additional context or verification. However, based on the information provided, it seems plausible that such an event could occur, and charging a fee for attendance is not uncommon for political or public events.

Without further details or verification from official sources, it is difficult to definitively classify the claim as fully true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate classification based on the available information is:

"Says Jeff Brandes voted to allow state-run Citizens Property Insurance to dump policies onto ""out-of-state, unregulated private companies.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim about Jeff Brandes, we need to consider the context and details of the legislation he voted on and the implications for Citizens Property Insurance and policyholders.

1. **Context and Vote**: Jeff Brandes is a Florida state senator. The claim likely refers to a specific legislative action or vote related to Citizens Property Insurance, which is a state-run insurance company in Florida.

2. **Dumping Policies**: The term ""dumping policies"" suggests that Citizens Property Insurance would transfer policies to out-of-state, unregulated private companies. This is a strong assertion that implies a significant change in how policies are managed and the regulatory oversight of the companies receiving these policies.

3. **State-Run Insurance**: Citizens Property Insurance is designed to provide coverage to homeowners who cannot obtain insurance from private companies. Any legislation allowing the transfer of policies to out-of-state, unregulated companies would be a significant shift in policy.

4. **Regulation**: The claim that these private companies are ""unregulated"" is crucial. If the companies are indeed unregulated, this could pose risks to policyholders in terms of coverage and claims handling.

Without specific details on the legislation and Brandes' exact vote, it's challenging to definitively say whether the claim is entirely accurate. However, if Brandes did vote for a measure that allows Citizens Property Insurance to transfer policies to out-of-state, unregulated companies, the claim would have some basis in truth.

Given the strong language and the potential for nuance in legislative actions, a cautious approach would be to label this claim as 'Half True' pending further verification of the specifics of the legislation and the regulatory status of the companies involved.

However, generally speaking, political statements about supporters often contain some truth but may not be entirely accurate.

Given the typical complexity of political support, it is likely that while the statement may be true for a significant portion of supporters, there could still be some special interest groups among them. Therefore, without specific evidence, a reasonable assessment would be:

Said that his batting average with Congress is higher than every other president since Dwight D. Eisenhower except Lyndon Johnson.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that a president's batting average with Congress is higher than every other president since Dwight D. Eisenhower except Lyndon Johnson, we would need to consider the following factors:

1. **Definition of 'Batting Average'**: This typically refers to the percentage of a president's legislative proposals that are enacted into law.
2. **Historical Data**: Comparing the legislative success rates of all presidents from Eisenhower to the present.
3. **Accuracy of the Claim**: Verifying if the president in question indeed has a higher batting average than all others in that period, except Lyndon Johnson.

Without specific data, we can't definitively verify the claim. However, assuming the claim is based on reliable sources and accurate data, here's a general approach:

- **True**: If the data unequivocally supports that the president's batting average is higher than all others except Lyndon Johnson.
- **Mostly True**: If the data largely supports the claim but there might be minor discrepancies or exceptions.
- **Half True**: If the data is mixed, with some supporting evidence but also significant counterexamples.
- **Mostly False**: If the data largely contradicts the claim, with only minor supporting evidence.
- **False**: If the data unequivocally contradicts the claim.

Given the nature of the claim and the potential complexity of the data, a cautious assessment might lean towards 'Half True' unless specific data is provided to support a stronger conclusion.

"I deployed the Texas National Guard to the Texas-Mexico border. ""And the policy worked; apprehensions at the border declined 74 percent.""",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we need context and data regarding the deployment of the Texas National Guard and the subsequent impact on border apprehensions. Without specific data, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on general knowledge and historical trends:

1. **Deployment of National Guard**: The deployment of the National Guard to the border has occurred under various administrations, often as a response to perceived crises or increased border activity.
2. **Apprehensions**: There can be fluctuations in apprehension numbers due to various factors, including changes in policy, seasonal migration patterns, and economic conditions in both the U.S. and source countries.
3. **Correlation vs. Causation**: While a decline in apprehensions might coincide with the deployment of the National Guard, it's important to distinguish between correlation and causation. Other factors could contribute to the decline, such as changes in immigration policy, economic conditions, or enforcement strategies.

Given these considerations, the claim that the policy worked and apprehensions declined by 74 percent is likely overstating the direct impact of the National Guard deployment. It is more reasonable to suggest that the deployment may have been one of several factors contributing to the decline.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,True,False
Clinton aides admit it (a gas tax holiday) won't do much for you – but would help her politically.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the statements made by Clinton aides. The claim suggests that Clinton aides acknowledged that a gas tax holiday would not significantly benefit consumers but would be politically advantageous for Hillary Clinton.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton proposed a gas tax holiday to provide relief from high gas prices. Critics, including some within her own party, argued that the measure would have minimal impact on consumers and could potentially harm infrastructure funding. Some Clinton aides did acknowledge that the political benefits of the proposal were a consideration.

Given this background, the claim has elements of truth but also some exaggeration. While some aides may have recognized the political benefits, it's not accurate to say they universally admitted it would do little for consumers. The proposal was still framed as a way to provide some relief, even if the impact was debated.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
We are giving almost $2 billion of taxpayer money to the junk food and fast food industries every year to make the (childhood obesity) epidemic worse.,false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and data surrounding government subsidies and their relationship to the junk food and fast food industries.

1. **Government Subsidies**: The U.S. government provides subsidies to various agricultural products, such as corn, soybeans, and sugar, which are often used as ingredients in junk food and fast food.

2. **Link to Junk Food and Fast Food**: These subsidized commodities are indeed used in the production of many junk food and fast food items. For example, high-fructose corn syrup from subsidized corn is a common ingredient in many processed foods and beverages.

3. **Amount of Money**: The claim mentions ""$2 billion of taxpayer money."" While the exact amount can vary and is subject to debate, studies have indicated that substantial amounts of subsidies do flow into industries that produce ingredients commonly used in junk food and fast food.

4. **Impact on Childhood Obesity**: The link between these subsidies and the worsening of the childhood obesity epidemic is more indirect. While subsidies may contribute to the affordability and availability of certain foods, other factors such as marketing, lifestyle, and socioeconomic conditions also play significant roles in childhood obesity.

Given these points, the claim has elements of truth but also oversimplifies a complex issue. The subsidies do support industries that produce ingredients used in junk food and fast food, and these subsidies are significant. However, the direct link to worsening the childhood obesity epidemic is less clear-cut.

1. **Unemployment Increase**: Whether New Jersey had the highest increase in unemployment under Chris Christie.
2. **Unemployment Rate**: Nearly 1 in 10 jobless.
3. **Regional Unemployment Comparison**: The worst unemployment in the region.
4. **Economic Growth**: Near the bottom in economic growth.
5. **Tax Cut for Millionaires**: Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires.
6. **Minimum Wage Veto**: Christie vetoed a minimum wage hike.

Without specific data and context, it's challenging to verify each claim fully. However, based on historical context and general economic trends, we can make an educated assessment:

1. **Unemployment Increase**: This claim would need specific data from the year in question to verify.
2. **Unemployment Rate**: Nearly 1 in 10 jobless (around 10%) is a high unemployment rate, but it would need to be compared to national and regional averages.
3. **Regional Unemployment Comparison**: This requires comparison with other states in the region.
4. **Economic Growth**: This would need economic growth data for New Jersey compared to other states.
5. **Tax Cut for Millionaires**: This is a policy action that can be verified through legislative records.
6. **Minimum Wage Veto**: This is also a policy action that can be verified through legislative records.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data, the claim can be considered partially true but requires further verification for complete accuracy.

A filibuster is a political procedure where one or more members of parliament or congress debate over a proposed piece of legislation so as to delay or entirely prevent a decision being made on the proposal. If the person making the claim was indeed subjected to such a tactic, then the claim would be true. However, without additional context or evidence, it's challenging to definitively determine the accuracy of the statement.

Given the lack of context, a reasonable assessment would be that the claim could be partially true but requires more information for full verification.

This (Ebola) is not as bad as SARS was in 2003.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""This (Ebola) is not as bad as SARS was in 2003,"" we need to consider various factors such as mortality rates, transmission rates, and overall impact.

1. **Mortality Rates**:
   - Ebola: The mortality rate for Ebola can be as high as 90% in some outbreaks, although it varies.
   - SARS: The mortality rate for SARS was approximately 10%.

2. **Transmission Rates**:
   - Ebola: Ebola is less contagious than SARS. It primarily spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids from infected people or contaminated objects.
   - SARS: SARS was more easily transmitted through respiratory droplets, making it more contagious in certain settings.

3. **Overall Impact**:
   - Ebola: Ebola outbreaks have been more geographically contained, primarily affecting regions in Africa, but have had significant local impacts.
   - SARS: The 2003 SARS outbreak spread more rapidly across multiple countries, causing significant global concern and economic disruption.

Considering these factors, while Ebola has a higher mortality rate, SARS had a more rapid and widespread transmission, causing greater global concern at the time. Therefore, the claim that Ebola is not as bad as SARS was in 2003 is somewhat accurate but oversimplifies the comparison.

Gov. Romney cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were on Medicaid to save $5 a day.,mostly false,en,"The claim that ""Gov. Romney cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were on Medicaid to save $5 a day"" is often discussed in political contexts, particularly during Romney's presidential campaigns. The claim is based on a policy change in Massachusetts during Romney's tenure as governor.

Here's a breakdown of the claim:

1. **Kosher Meals**: The state did propose cutting reimbursements for kosher meals for Medicaid recipients to save money.
2. **Cost Savings**: The estimated savings were indeed small, reportedly around $5 per day per person.
3. **Outcome**: After opposition from Jewish groups and advocates, the state reversed the decision and continued to provide kosher meals.

While it is true that there was a proposal to cut these meals to save money, the final outcome was that the meals were not cut due to public pressure and advocacy. Therefore, the claim that Romney actually ""cut off"" kosher meals is not entirely accurate because the policy change was ultimately reversed.

Without specific data points, it is difficult to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, given the general trend of increasing government spending over time and the significant spending related to the economic stimulus in response to the Great Recession, it is plausible that spending during the 111th Congress was very high. That said, the claim that it exceeded the combined spending of the first 100 congresses is likely exaggerated.

"Last year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Last year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion,"" we need to consider the context and the specific actions taken by the individual making the claim. Without additional details, such as who made the claim or the specific measures they took, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can offer a general approach to evaluating such a claim.

1. **Identify the Individual**: Who made the claim? Their role and authority would be crucial in determining the accuracy of the statement.
2. **Specific Actions**: What specific actions did this individual take to stop the alleged ""Obamacare bailout""?
3. **Official Records and Reports**: Are there any official records, reports, or independent analyses that support the claim of saving $2.5 billion?
4. **Impact Assessment**: How did the actions impact the overall costs and savings related to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)?

We've made other countries rich while the wealth ... of our country has dissipated over the horizon.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider economic data and trade dynamics. While it's true that global trade can lead to wealth accumulation in other countries, it's also important to note that trade is typically mutually beneficial. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Trade Deficits**: If a country imports more than it exports, it can lead to a transfer of wealth. However, trade deficits do not necessarily mean the country is becoming poorer, as they also reflect consumption and investment.

2. **Foreign Investment**: Wealth can also flow back into the country through foreign investment, which can be beneficial for the economy.

3. **Job Creation and Economic Growth**: Trade can lead to job creation and economic growth in certain sectors, even if there is a trade deficit.

Given these nuances, the statement is not entirely accurate, but it does reflect a perspective on global trade dynamics.

"Ten times, no Republican candidate for president had enough delegates to claim the nomination before the party’s convention, and seven of those times ""somebody who was not the leader of delegates was selected as the nominee of the party.""",mostly true,en,"To verify the claim, we need to look at the history of Republican National Conventions and the nomination process.

Historically, there have been several instances where no Republican candidate had enough delegates to clinch the nomination before the convention. However, the exact number of times and the outcomes can vary based on different interpretations and historical records.

1. **Brokered Conventions**: There have been several brokered conventions in the history of the Republican Party, where the nominee was not clear before the convention. Notable examples include the conventions of 1880, 1920, 1940, and 1952.

2. **Selection of Non-Leading Candidates**: In some of these conventions, the eventual nominee was not the leader in delegates going into the convention. For example, in 1940, Wendell Willkie was not the leading candidate in terms of delegates but was ultimately selected as the nominee.

However, the claim that this happened ""seven"" times specifically is not well-documented and may be an overstatement. The exact count can be debated based on different interpretations of historical events.

Given the historical evidence, the claim is partially accurate but may overstate the frequency of such occurrences. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Maggie Hassan served in the New Hampshire Senate from 2004 to 2010. During this period, we would need to look at the unemployment rates for New Hampshire and compare them to the unemployment rates of other states to determine if New Hampshire indeed had the fourth-lowest unemployment rate.

Without specific data for each year during her tenure, it is challenging to verify the exact ranking. However, New Hampshire has historically had a relatively low unemployment rate compared to other states. If the claim is based on accurate data for the specific years of her tenure, it could be considered accurate.

Given the general consistency of New Hampshire's low unemployment rates, the claim is plausible but would require specific data for each year to be fully verified.

Says Rick Perry increased spending in Texas by more than 50 percent.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that Rick Perry increased spending in Texas by more than 50 percent, we need to look at the data on state spending during his tenure as governor.

Rick Perry served as the Governor of Texas from December 2000 to January 2015. During his tenure, Texas experienced significant population growth and economic changes, which can affect state spending.

According to data from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts and other sources, state spending did increase during Perry's time in office. However, the increase was not as dramatic as the claim suggests. When adjusted for inflation and population growth, the increase in spending was more modest.

For example, some analyses show that state spending per capita, adjusted for inflation, increased by around 10-20 percent over the course of Perry's governorship. This is significantly less than the 50 percent increase claimed.

Therefore, while there was an increase in spending, the claim that it was more than 50 percent is exaggerated.

The Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years than the total number of tenured (UW) faculty fired during the last two decades.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the number of starting quarterbacks the Chicago Bears have had in the last 10 years with the number of tenured faculty fired at the University of Washington (UW) in the last two decades.

1. **Chicago Bears Starting Quarterbacks (Last 10 Years):**
   The Chicago Bears have had a significant turnover at the quarterback position. From 2013 to 2023, the Bears have had multiple starting quarterbacks, including Jay Cutler, Brian Hoyer, Matt Barkley, Mike Glennon, Mitchell Trubisky, Chase Daniel, Nick Foles, Andy Dalton, and Justin Fields. This list includes at least 9 different starting quarterbacks.

2. **Tenured Faculty Fired at UW (Last Two Decades):**
   Firing tenured faculty is a rare and serious action. Universities typically have rigorous processes in place to protect tenured faculty, and dismissals are uncommon. While exact numbers can be hard to find without specific data, it is generally known that tenured faculty dismissals are very low.

Given the rarity of tenured faculty dismissals and the relatively high number of starting quarterbacks for the Bears, it is likely that the number of tenured faculty fired at UW in the last two decades is significantly lower than the number of Bears starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years.

While it is true that several legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have been dismissed or rejected, the number of judges who have thrown out these challenges is not precisely twelve, and the reasons for dismissal can vary beyond just rejecting the notion of unconstitutionality. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but is also not completely true.

"If you are driving on average in America this summer, you'll save — according to Department of Energy figures — about $70.",false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and data from the Department of Energy. The statement suggests that the average driver in America will save about $70 this summer based on Department of Energy figures.

Without specific data from the Department of Energy for the summer in question, it's difficult to verify the exact amount of savings. However, if the Department of Energy has published figures that indicate a reduction in fuel costs or other savings that would amount to approximately $70 for the average driver over the summer, then the claim could be considered mostly accurate.

Given the general nature of the claim and the potential variability in fuel prices and driving habits, it's reasonable to assume that the savings might not be exact for every driver but could be a reasonable estimate for many.

When the car was ""extricated"" from the crowd, a truck blocked a second exit.",false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the specific details provided and whether they align with verified reports or evidence. Without additional context or sources to corroborate the events described, it is challenging to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the information given, here's a breakdown:

1. **Protesters blocking an exit and surrounding a State Patrol car**: This part of the claim suggests a direct and potentially aggressive interaction between protesters and law enforcement.
2. **Beating on the windows and rocking the vehicle**: This describes a more intense and potentially violent confrontation.
3. **The car being ""extricated"" from the crowd**: This implies that the car was successfully removed from the situation.
4. **A truck blocking a second exit**: This indicates a coordinated effort to impede movement.

Without specific evidence or corroborating reports, the claim contains elements that could be true but also requires verification. The description of the protesters' actions is dramatic and could be exaggerated or misrepresented without further context.

I’m the first Democrat to ever lead Scott Walker in an election year.,false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""I’m the first Democrat to ever lead Scott Walker in an election year,"" we need to consider the context and historical data regarding Scott Walker's political career and the performance of Democratic candidates against him.

Scott Walker served as the Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019. During his tenure, he faced several elections, including a recall election in 2012 and regular gubernatorial elections in 2010, 2014, and 2018.

- In the 2010 election, Walker won against Democrat Tom Barrett.
- In the 2012 recall election, Walker again won against Tom Barrett.
- In the 2014 election, Walker won against Democrat Mary Burke.
- In the 2018 election, Walker was defeated by Democrat Tony Evers.

Given this information, the claim that a Democrat led Scott Walker in an election year would need to be verified by polling data or election results. If a Democrat did indeed lead in polls or won an election against Walker, the claim could be considered true or mostly true, depending on the specifics.

However, without specific polling data or context, it is difficult to definitively assert the truth of the claim. Generally, it is known that Walker faced tough competition from Democrats, especially in the 2018 election when he lost to Tony Evers.

"Says New Jersey’s job growth in May represents ""25 percent of all the jobs created in the country.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""New Jersey’s job growth in May represents '25 percent of all the jobs created in the country,'"" we would need to examine the official job growth statistics for New Jersey and the entire United States for the month of May. Here’s a step-by-step approach to determine the validity of the claim:

1. **Identify the Sources**: Check the official reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or any relevant state labor department for May job growth data.
2. **Compare the Numbers**: Compare the number of jobs created in New Jersey with the total number of jobs created in the U.S.
3. **Calculate the Percentage**: Determine if New Jersey's job growth indeed represents 25 percent of the national job growth.

Without the specific numbers, we can't complete the calculation. However, generally speaking, it is highly unusual for a single state to account for such a large proportion of the nation's job growth. States like California or Texas, which have much larger populations and economies, typically account for a significant portion of national job growth, but even they rarely reach 25 percent.

Given this context, it is likely that the claim is exaggerated.

"House Republican plan would increase costs for Oregon seniors by $6,000 with health care vouchers instead of Medicare",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break down the key points:

1. **House Republican Plan**: This likely refers to proposals by some House Republicans to transition Medicare to a premium support system, often called ""vouchers.""
2. **Increase Costs for Oregon Seniors by $6,000**: This is a specific financial impact claim.

The claim that a House Republican plan would increase costs for Oregon seniors by $6,000 with health care vouchers instead of Medicare is a complex one that requires detailed analysis of the proposed plan and its financial implications. Several factors need to be considered:

- **Specifics of the Plan**: The details of the proposed plan, including the value of the vouchers and how they would be adjusted over time.
- **Cost Comparison**: A comparison of the current Medicare benefits and costs with the proposed voucher system.
- **Geographic Variation**: The impact on Oregon specifically, as health care costs can vary by region.

Without access to the specific details of the plan and a comprehensive analysis, it is challenging to definitively say whether the claim is entirely accurate. However, similar proposals in the past, such as those by former House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, have been analyzed and found to potentially increase out-of-pocket costs for seniors, though the exact amount can vary.

Given the lack of specific details and the variability in analyses, the claim could be considered partially accurate but not fully substantiated without more context.

"Says President Barack Obama ""has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation,"" while Congress ""has taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the available data on presidential and congressional vacation days.

### Presidential Vacation Days:
- President Barack Obama took a significant number of vacation days, but comparisons with other presidents can be complex due to varying definitions of ""vacation days."" For example, some presidents continued to work while on vacation at their personal residences.
- According to various sources, Obama took fewer vacation days than George W. Bush during his eight years in office. However, comparing across multiple presidencies can be challenging due to inconsistent reporting and differing definitions.

### Congressional Vacation Days:
- The claim that Congress has taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history is more straightforward to verify. Congressional schedules are publicly available, and the number of days Congress is in session can be compared across different periods.
- Recent reports and analyses have shown that Congress has been in session for fewer days compared to historical averages, which could be interpreted as taking more vacation days.

### Conclusion:
- The claim that President Barack Obama ""has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation"" is somewhat ambiguous and depends on definitions and comparisons but is partially supported by data comparing him to his immediate predecessors.
- The claim that Congress ""has taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history"" is more substantiated by available data on congressional sessions.

Given these points, the claim is partially true but requires nuance and context.

This would involve reviewing the bills he sponsored or co-sponsored, as well as their outcomes and impact on the black community in terms of education and workforce development. Without specific data on the bills he introduced and their outcomes, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, if the claim is that he has not passed any laws specifically aimed at helping the black community with education or workforce, it could be interpreted in several ways:

1. **True**: If there is verifiable evidence that Joe Morrissey did not introduce or pass any legislation specifically targeting education or workforce development for the black community.
2. **Mostly True**: If the majority of his legislative efforts did not focus on these areas, but there might be a minor exception or effort that did not result in passed legislation.
3. **Half True**: If there is a mix of efforts, some focused on the black community but not resulting in passed laws, and others not focused on these areas at all.

(Bill) Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere.,mostly true,en,"The claim that ""(Bill) Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere"" is a complex one and requires a detailed examination of Nelson's voting record and the context of earmarks.

Firstly, the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" was a proposed project in Alaska that became a symbol of wasteful government spending. The project was included in the Highway Bill of 2005 (SAFETEA-LU). While the bridge itself was ultimately not constructed due to public outcry, the bill containing the earmark did pass Congress.

Bill Nelson, a former Senator from Florida, was a member of the Senate at the time this bill was passed. It is accurate to say that he voted for the Highway Bill of 2005, which included the earmark for the Bridge to Nowhere. However, it is important to note that voting for a bill that includes a controversial earmark does not necessarily mean that the Senator supported that specific earmark. Legislators often vote for bills that contain provisions they do not support because the overall benefits of the bill outweigh the negatives.

Given these nuances, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true. It is accurate that Nelson voted for a bill that included the Bridge to Nowhere earmark, but it is not clear that he specifically supported that earmark.

1. **Percentage of Uninsured Americans**: According to recent data from sources like the U.S. Census Bureau, around 15% of Americans are uninsured.

2. **Income of Uninsured Americans**: The claim states that half of these uninsured Americans make more than $50,000 a year.

To verify this claim, we would need to look at detailed reports from reliable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Kaiser Family Foundation, or other health policy research organizations. These reports typically provide breakdowns of the uninsured population by income level.

While I don't have access to real-time data, based on general trends and historical data, it is known that a significant portion of the uninsured population is low-income. However, it is also true that some higher-income individuals choose not to have health insurance for various reasons, including affordability concerns or personal preferences.

Given the complexity of the issue and the lack of specific real-time data, it is reasonable to conclude that while some higher-income individuals are uninsured, the claim that half of them make more than $50,000 a year is likely an overestimation.

1. **""Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals…""**
   - This part of the claim suggests that Mike Madigan has personally profited from tax appeals. To verify this, we would need specific evidence of his financial gains from this activity.

2. **""Saving his friends millions...""**
   - This implies that Madigan has used his influence to help his friends reduce their property taxes significantly. Evidence would be required to show that his actions directly resulted in millions of dollars in savings for his friends.

3. **""It’s an inside game played by people like Merry Marwig, Madigan’s hand-picked candidate.""**
   - This part of the claim suggests that Merry Marwig is involved in a corrupt system and that she is a hand-picked candidate by Madigan. To verify this, we would need evidence of Marwig's involvement in such activities and her relationship with Madigan.

4. **""When Marwig thought her property taxes were too high she got them lowered at your expense. Saved so much she did it again.""**
   - This implies that Marwig successfully appealed her property taxes multiple times, resulting in significant savings at the expense of others. Evidence would be required to show that her tax appeals were successful and that they had a detrimental effect on others.

5. **""Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system.""**
   - This part of the claim suggests that both Marwig and Madigan are benefiting from a corrupt system. To verify this, we would need evidence of their involvement in corrupt practices and the specific benefits they have received.

1. **Verification of the Source**: The claim does not specify which ""private 'security' company"" is being referred to, nor does it provide any specific details about the locations of the camps or the purposes behind their establishment.

2. **Credible Reporting**: There is no widespread or credible reporting from major news outlets that supports this claim. Typically, the establishment of large-scale camps, especially by a private security company linked to a former president, would garner significant media attention.

3. **Context and Plausibility**: It is highly implausible that such a significant action would go unreported by mainstream media. Additionally, the phrasing ""Obama’s Private ‘security’ Company"" suggests a level of direct control or involvement by former President Obama, which is not substantiated.

It is already in the law that there is a requirement to screen (refugees) for religion.,mostly true,en,"To accurately assess the claim that ""It is already in the law that there is a requirement to screen (refugees) for religion,"" it is essential to consider the legal frameworks regarding refugee screening in various countries. Generally, refugee screening processes focus on security, criminal background checks, medical screenings, and verifying persecution claims. While religious persecution is a recognized ground for seeking asylum, there is typically no explicit requirement to screen refugees solely for their religion.

In the United States, for example, the Immigration and Nationality Act outlines the criteria for refugee status, which includes persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. However, the screening process does not specifically mandate a religious test but rather assesses the overall credibility and context of persecution claims.

Given this context, the claim that there is a legal requirement to screen refugees for religion is not entirely accurate. While religious persecution is a factor considered in the screening process, it is not a standalone requirement.

Comparisons to past recessions, including the Great Recession of 2008 and others, show that the current recovery has unique characteristics but is not necessarily the ""worst"" in all metrics.

John McCain's health care plan during his 2008 presidential campaign included a proposal to replace the existing tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance with a tax credit. This meant that the value of employer-provided health insurance would be treated as taxable income, but individuals would receive a tax credit to help offset the cost of purchasing health insurance.

The claim suggests that McCain's plan would leave individuals ""on your own to pay McCain’s health insurance tax."" This is a simplification that could be misleading. While it is true that the plan would have ended the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance, it also included a tax credit to help individuals purchase insurance. The plan aimed to make the health insurance market more competitive and give individuals more control over their health care choices.

However, the claim that individuals would be left ""on your own"" to pay for health insurance is not entirely accurate because the tax credit was intended to provide financial assistance. The impact on individuals would depend on various factors, including their income level and the cost of health insurance in their area.

Given the complexity of the proposal and the fact that it included both a tax increase (by ending the exclusion) and a tax credit, the claim is not entirely false but also not fully accurate.

Ninety percent of the topsoil has inadequate moisture to grow crops.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim 'Ninety percent of the topsoil has inadequate moisture to grow crops,' we need to consider the following:

1. **Global Variability**: Soil moisture conditions vary widely across different regions of the world. Some regions may be experiencing drought, while others may have adequate or excess moisture.
2. **Data Source**: Reliable global data on soil moisture would typically come from scientific organizations or agricultural authorities. Without a specific source or study cited, it's challenging to verify the exact percentage.
3. **Historical Context**: Soil moisture can change over time due to weather patterns, climate change, and irrigation practices.

Given the lack of specific data or a cited source, it's difficult to confirm if exactly 90% of the topsoil globally has inadequate moisture for crop growth. However, it's plausible that a significant portion of topsoil may be affected by moisture issues due to various factors like drought and climate change.

"Says Mitt Romney suggested that ""employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.""",true,en,"To evaluate the claim, let's examine what Mitt Romney has actually said and his positions on the issue.

Mitt Romney has not explicitly stated that ""employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage."" However, during his political career, Romney has expressed support for religious exemptions to the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act. He has argued that employers, particularly those with religious objections, should have the right to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage.

This position implies that employers would have some control over whether contraception is included in their employees' health insurance plans, but it does not directly state that employers should be able to make this decision in all cases.

Given this context, the claim is somewhat accurate but oversimplifies Romney's stance and does not capture the nuances of his position.

"Says because of his actions, Wisconsin ""property taxes today are lower than they were four years ago.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""because of his actions, Wisconsin 'property taxes today are lower than they were four years ago,'"" we would need to review data on Wisconsin property taxes over the specified period and assess any causal relationship with the individual's actions.

Here are steps to verify the claim:

1. **Check Property Tax Data**: Look at official records from Wisconsin's Department of Revenue or other relevant sources to compare property tax levels over the past four years.
2. **Identify Actions Taken**: Determine what specific actions the individual took that could have impacted property taxes.
3. **Assess Causality**: Evaluate whether the actions taken can be directly linked to the change in property tax levels.

Without specific data and context, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, if we assume the data supports a decline in property taxes and there is evidence linking this decline to the individual's actions, the claim could be considered partly true. If the data does not support a decline or the actions taken are not clearly linked to the decline, the claim would be less true.

"In Congress, (Cresent Hardy) voted to defund DACA.",half true,en,"To accurately assess the claim that Cresent Hardy voted to defund DACA, we need to review his voting record during his time in Congress. DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) is an executive action that provides temporary relief from deportation for certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.

Cresent Hardy served as a U.S. Representative from Nevada's 4th congressional district from 2015 to 2017. During this time, there were several votes related to funding and immigration policies, including attempts to defund or limit DACA.

One notable vote occurred in 2015 when the House of Representatives voted on H.R. 3009, the ""Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act."" This bill included provisions that would have restricted funding related to DACA. Cresent Hardy voted in favor of this bill, which would have effectively defunded DACA if it had become law.

Given this information, the claim that Cresent Hardy voted to defund DACA is accurate.

"Says Bernie Sanders’ health care plan would ""empower Republican governors to take away Medicaid, to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans.""",mostly false,en,"The claim that Bernie Sanders' health care plan would ""empower Republican governors to take away Medicaid, to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans"" is not accurate. Bernie Sanders' proposed health care plan, known as Medicare for All, aims to provide universal, single-payer health care coverage for all Americans. This plan would replace the current system, including Medicaid, with a federal program that covers everyone.

Under Medicare for All, states would not have the power to take away health insurance from low-income and middle-income individuals, as the program would be federally administered and guaranteed. Therefore, the claim that it would empower Republican governors to take away Medicaid or health insurance is false.

"Says if Texas abortion measure passes, ""someone living in El Paso would have to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for something as simple as cervical cancer screening.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Distance from El Paso to San Antonio**: The driving distance from El Paso to San Antonio is approximately 550 miles each way. This part of the claim is true and can be verified using any mapping service.

2. **Impact of the Texas abortion measure on cervical cancer screening**: The Texas abortion measure (SB 8) primarily focuses on restricting abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. It does not directly restrict access to cervical cancer screenings. However, the concern might be about the broader impact on women's health services, such as clinic closures or reduced access to healthcare providers. This part is more complex and not as straightforward as the distance claim.

Given that the distance claim is true but the implications for cervical cancer screenings are less clear and not a direct consequence of the measure, the overall claim is a mix of true and potentially misleading information.

"Says the United States has ""treaties with apparently 69 countries where we are obligated to defend their borders.

Firstly, the United States does have mutual defense treaties with several countries, primarily through organizations like NATO, which includes 30 member countries. Additionally, the U.S. has bilateral defense treaties with countries like Japan, South Korea, and Australia.

However, the claim that these treaties are ""executive treaties, not authorized by Congress"" is misleading. In the United States, treaties are typically ratified by the Senate, which is part of Congress. Executive agreements, which do not require Senate ratification, are less common for significant mutual defense pacts.

Given these points, the claim is partially correct about the number of countries with defense treaties but incorrect about the nature of these treaties being ""executive treaties"" not authorized by Congress.

"Spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars because of Arizona’s immigration laws that drove out undocumented immigrants.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the impact of Arizona's immigration laws on spending in the areas mentioned: welfare, prisons, and education.

Arizona's immigration laws, particularly SB 1070, were designed to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants in the state. Studies and reports have shown mixed results regarding the economic impact of these laws. Some analyses suggest that reduced immigration did lead to savings in certain areas, such as reduced demand for social services, lower prison populations, and fewer students in public schools. However, other costs, such as legal expenses and economic losses from reduced labor and consumer spending, also need to be considered.

Given the complexity and the range of studies, it is difficult to conclusively state that spending on welfare, prisons, and education all dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars solely due to Arizona's immigration laws. While there may have been some reductions in spending, the claim overstates the impact without considering the broader economic context and other factors.

- It is true that members of Congress and their staff were required to enroll in health care plans through the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) exchanges, with a government contribution towards their premiums.
- However, the claim that Obama and members of his administration have ""gold-plated health care plans"" is misleading. The President, Vice President, and their immediate families are eligible for medical care through the White House Medical Unit, which is not a ""gold-plated health care plan"" but rather a medical team providing direct care. Other members of the administration typically receive the same health insurance available to other federal employees, which is not a special ""gold-plated"" plan but rather a standard benefit.

"In Missouri, there are still (FEMA) cases pending from floods that occurred in 2013.",mostly true,en,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that there are still FEMA cases pending from floods that occurred in 2013 in Missouri, we need to consider the typical timelines for FEMA case resolutions and any available data on pending cases.

FEMA cases typically involve various stages, including initial assessment, damage evaluation, funding allocation, and recovery efforts. While some cases may take several years to resolve due to complexities and appeals, it is less common for cases to remain pending for a decade without significant progress.

Without specific data on the number of pending cases from 2013, it is difficult to definitively determine the truth of the claim. However, given the general timelines for FEMA case resolutions, it is likely that most cases from 2013 would have been resolved by now.

Therefore, the claim is likely 'Mostly False'.

Without knowing the specific bill, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, accusations that a bill ""essentially encourages child trafficking"" are typically hyperbolic and often misrepresent the intent and actual effects of legislation.

If the bill in question aimed to address immigration, human rights, or similar issues, it's important to look at the context and the specific language of the bill. Bills aimed at protecting or assisting vulnerable populations, such as children, often include safeguards and provisions to prevent exploitation, not encourage it.

Given the serious nature of the accusation and the lack of specific details provided, it is likely that this claim is a significant exaggeration or misrepresentation of the bill's intent and impact.

"Unlike virtually every other campaign, we don't have a super PAC.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Unlike virtually every other campaign, we don't have a super PAC,"" we need to consider the context and the prevalence of super PACs in political campaigns.

A super PAC (Political Action Committee) is an independent political committee that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against political candidates, but it is not allowed to coordinate directly with candidates or political parties.

The claim suggests that the speaker's campaign is unique in not having a super PAC, implying that almost all other campaigns do have them. While it is true that many campaigns have associated super PACs, it is not accurate to say that virtually every other campaign does. There are numerous campaigns, especially at the local and state levels, that do not have super PACs.

Given this context, the claim is exaggerated.

4. **Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers.**
5. **The most education funding ever.**

Without specific data or context (such as the time period or source of the claim), it's challenging to verify each point accurately. However, I can provide a general framework for how one might evaluate such claims:

1. **Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone.**
   - This would require looking at budget records and tax policies over the specified period.

2. **The best job growth in 12 years.**

4. **Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers.**
   - This would require checking education policies and reports on teacher compensation.

5. **The most education funding ever.**
   - This would involve looking at education budget allocations over time.

According to fact-checking organizations such as PolitiFact, Senator McCain voted against raising the minimum wage several times, but the claim that he did so exactly 19 times has been rated as ""Half True.""

In many jurisdictions, businesses do pay a significant portion of property taxes, but the exact percentage can vary widely depending on the region and specific policies. If the claim is based on reliable data from a credible source, such as a government report or a reputable research institution, it could be considered true or mostly true.

In the 2020 Gallup poll, 45% of Americans said they would vote for a socialist for president, while 60% said they would vote for an atheist. This indicates that voting for a socialist is indeed less popular than voting for an atheist, supporting the claim.

Therefore, based on the available data, the claim that ""When they get to the question on, 'Would you vote for a socialist,' it is even less popular than voting for atheists"" is accurate.

The insurance risk corridors aren't going broke like Republicans predicted.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""The insurance risk corridors aren't going broke like Republicans predicted,"" we need to examine the context and data related to the risk corridors program under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

The risk corridors program was designed to stabilize premiums in the individual health insurance market by sharing risk between the government and insurers. The program was in effect from 2014 to 2016. Republicans had predicted that the program would result in significant financial losses for the government.

However, the actual implementation of the risk corridors program revealed that while there were some losses, they were not as catastrophic as predicted. The program did face challenges, including a shortfall in collections that led to insurers receiving only a fraction of the payments they were owed. Despite this, the program did not go completely broke, and it served its purpose of stabilizing the market to some extent.

Given this context, the claim that ""The insurance risk corridors aren't going broke like Republicans predicted"" is mostly accurate, as the program did not collapse as dramatically as predicted, although it did face financial issues.

Without access to real-time data or the specific context of the stimulus package mentioned, I cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, I can provide a general framework for how such a claim might be evaluated:

1. **Identify the Stimulus Package:** Determine which stimulus package is being referred to (e.g., the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the CARES Act of 2020, etc.).
2. **Review Official Reports:** Check official government reports, such as those from the Treasury Department or the Office of Management and Budget, for the most recent data on spending.
3. **Compare Allocated vs. Spent Amounts:** Compare the total amount allocated in the stimulus package to the amount that has been reported as spent.

Given the lack of specific data, a hypothetical evaluation might look like this:

The idea that the EPA has specifically targeted puddles or drainage ditches on farms for extensive regulation is a mischaracterization.

While there have been debates and legal battles over the extent to which smaller bodies of water, including some ditches and ephemeral streams, should be regulated, the claim exaggerates the scope and intent of EPA regulations.

"To give a sense of how families are struggling, a record four out of every 10 school kids in Ohio now qualifies for subsidized lunch.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""a record four out of every 10 school kids in Ohio now qualifies for subsidized lunch,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Accuracy of the Data**: The claim states that 40% of school kids in Ohio qualify for subsidized lunch. This data should be verifiable through official sources such as the Ohio Department of Education or federal reports.

2. **Historical Context**: The claim mentions that this is a record number. To verify this, we need to compare the current data with historical data to see if this is indeed the highest percentage recorded.

3. **Source Reliability**: The source of the claim should be credible and based on recent, accurate data.

Given that I don't have real-time access to the latest data, I can provide a general framework for how to evaluate this claim. If the data is accurate and supported by official sources, and if it indeed represents a record high, the claim would be considered mostly true. However, without specific data verification, we cannot definitively say it is entirely true.

"Over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but 90 percent of that is as a consequence of President George W. Bush’s policies and the recession.",false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the factors contributing to the deficit increase over the specified period. According to economic analyses and data from sources like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a significant portion of the deficit increase during the early years of the Obama administration can indeed be attributed to the policies and economic conditions inherited from the Bush administration, including the financial crisis and subsequent recession, as well as the ongoing costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

However, while the Bush-era policies and the recession were major contributors, some increase in the deficit was also due to new policies and actions taken during the Obama administration, such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (stimulus package).

Given this context, the claim is largely accurate but not entirely so, as it does not fully account for the contributions from new policies and actions under the Obama administration.

One in six Texans don’t have health care. We’re the most uninsured state in the U.S.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on health insurance coverage in Texas and compare it with other states.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2021 American Community Survey, approximately 17.3% of Texans were uninsured, which is roughly one in six people. When comparing this rate to other states, Texas does have one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation. As of the latest data, Texas consistently ranks among the states with the highest percentage of uninsured residents.

Given this information, the claim that ""One in six Texans don’t have health care. We’re the most uninsured state in the U.S."" is largely accurate. While there might be slight fluctuations in the ranking based on the most recent data, the general statement holds true.

"Trump has ""worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Trump has 'worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman,'"" we need to look at the legislative record of President Trump during his first 100 days and compare it with other presidents.

According to historical data, President Trump signed 28 bills into law during his first 100 days in office. However, this number is not the highest among presidents since Truman. For instance, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed 76 bills into law during his first 100 days, and President Harry S. Truman signed 55 bills.

Based on this comparison, the claim that Trump signed more legislation than any president since Truman is inaccurate. Therefore, the claim is false.

Law firm @POTUS used to show he has no ties to Russia was named Russia Law Firm of the Year for their extensive ties to Russia. Unreal.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two main parts:

1. The law firm used by @POTUS (assuming this refers to a specific U.S. President) was named ""Russia Law Firm of the Year.""
2. The law firm has extensive ties to Russia.

Let's examine these points:

1. **Russia Law Firm of the Year:**
   - This claim suggests that a law firm, which was used by a specific U.S. President to demonstrate no ties to Russia, was recognized as the ""Russia Law Firm of the Year."" This specific award would typically come from a reputable legal publication or organization.

2. **Extensive ties to Russia:**
   - This part of the claim implies that the law firm has significant business or legal connections in Russia.

Without specific details about the law firm, the context, and the source of the ""Russia Law Firm of the Year"" award, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, if such a law firm were used to demonstrate no ties to Russia, and it had indeed received such an award, it would likely be widely reported and scrutinized by media outlets and fact-checking organizations.

Given the lack of specific details and the potential for misinterpretation or misinformation, the claim is not straightforward to validate or refute without further context. However, based on the general principles of fact-checking and the need for verifiable evidence, the claim appears to be exaggerated or misleading without concrete evidence.

"Allowing all Bush income tax cuts to expire on Dec. 31 ""will amount to the largest tax increase in the history of America.""",mostly false,en,"The claim that allowing all Bush income tax cuts to expire on Dec. 31 ""will amount to the largest tax increase in the history of America"" is a complex one and requires some context to evaluate accurately.

1. **Magnitude of the Tax Increase**: The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were significant and affected a broad range of taxpayers. Allowing them to expire would indeed result in a substantial increase in taxes.

2. **Historical Context**: To determine if it is the ""largest tax increase in the history of America,"" one needs to compare it to other significant tax increases in U.S. history, such as those during the World Wars or the Revenue Act of 1942.

3. **Economic Impact**: The size of the tax increase would be measured not just in absolute terms but also in its impact on the economy and taxpayers.

4. **Political Rhetoric**: Claims about the ""largest"" anything often involve political rhetoric and can be subjective.

Given these points, while the expiration of the Bush tax cuts would be a significant tax increase, declaring it the ""largest in history"" is debatable without a thorough comparative analysis of all historical tax increases. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true.

Poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary,"" we need to consider the context and the available data at the time the statement was made. Without specific dates or polls referenced, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, generally, such claims are often scrutinized by fact-checking organizations.

If the claim was made during a specific election cycle, fact-checkers would look at multiple polls from reputable sources to determine the accuracy of the statement. If a majority of polls indeed showed the speaker leading Hillary Clinton, the claim might be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the polls were mixed or inconclusive, it might be rated 'Half True'. If most polls did not support the claim, it would be considered 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific context, a general assessment would likely fall into the 'Half True' category, as it acknowledges that some polls might support the claim, but the overall picture is unclear without more details.

I haven't missed a vote since 1993.,true,en,"To determine the veracity of the claim ""I haven't missed a vote since 1993,"" we would need to verify voting records. Since I don't have access to real-time databases or specific individual records, I'll provide a general approach to how one might evaluate such a claim:

1. **Check Official Records**: Look at the voting records available through official government websites or databases.
2. **Media Reports**: Review news articles or fact-checking websites that have investigated the claim.
3. **Direct Verification**: If the individual is a public figure, their voting history may be publicly available and can be cross-referenced.

Given the lack of specific data, I'll make a hypothetical assessment:

- If there is no evidence of missed votes since 1993, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there are a few isolated instances of missed votes but the overall record is strong, it might be 'Mostly True'.
- If there are several instances but the individual has a generally good record, it could be 'Half True'.
- If there are many instances of missed votes, it would be 'Mostly False'.
- If the claim is clearly untrue with many missed votes, it would be 'False'.

Without specific data, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, for the purpose of this exercise, I'll hypothetically assume the claim is generally accurate but with a few minor exceptions.

However, since I don't have real-time access to the internet to verify this claim, I'll provide a general approach to how you might evaluate it:

1. **Check Official Reports**: Look for recent reports or publications from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services or other state agencies that oversee job training programs.
2. **Review State Budgets**: State budget documents often detail the number and types of programs funded, including job training initiatives.
3. **Consult Legislative Records**: Legislative reports or bills related to workforce development may provide insights into the number of programs and the agencies involved.
4. **Cross-Reference with Third-Party Sources**: Non-profit organizations, think tanks, or news outlets that cover state government affairs might also provide corroborating information.

Given the lack of specific verification tools in this context, the claim appears plausible but requires official confirmation. Without direct evidence, a cautious evaluation might classify it as:

"Back door gun control is in full effect in the United States due to ""Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""back door gun control is in full effect in the United States due to 'Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency,'"" we need to examine the role of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Obama administration in relation to gun control.

The EPA is primarily responsible for environmental regulations and protections. It does not have direct authority over gun control, which is typically under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and state laws.

There have been claims that the EPA has indirectly impacted gun control through regulations on lead ammunition, as lead is a toxic substance. However, these regulations are primarily focused on environmental and health concerns rather than gun control per se.

Given this context, the claim that the EPA under Obama was implementing ""back door gun control"" is an exaggeration and misrepresents the primary focus and authority of the EPA. While there may have been some regulatory impacts on the use of lead ammunition, these were driven by environmental concerns rather than a direct attempt to control guns.

One out of four corporations doesn't pay a nickel in (federal income) taxes.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at available data on corporate tax payments. According to various studies and reports, such as those from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a significant portion of large corporations do indeed pay little to no federal income taxes in a given year due to various tax breaks, deductions, and credits.

For example, ITEP reported that at least 55 of the largest corporations in the U.S. paid no federal corporate income taxes in their most recent fiscal year despite being profitable. While the claim does not specify the timeframe or the exact definition of ""corporations,"" the available data suggests that a substantial number of large corporations do not pay federal income taxes.

"For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent.",true,en,"The claim that ""For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent"" is a simplification of a more complex reality. While there is a well-documented positive correlation between education and income, the specific percentage increase can vary widely based on numerous factors such as the country, economic conditions, and the type of education.

Studies have shown that education generally leads to higher earnings, but the exact percentage increase is not universally 12 percent. For instance, some research suggests that each additional year of schooling can increase earnings by around 10 percent on average, but this figure can be lower or higher depending on the context.

We are the most generous in New England and New England is known for its generosity toward its welfare recipients.,half true,en,"To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze two parts:

1. Whether the speaker's group is the most generous in New England.
2. Whether New England is known for its generosity toward its welfare recipients.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as 'True' or 'False.' However, it's important to note that generosity can be subjective and varies based on different metrics. Additionally, while New England states do have reputations for robust social safety nets, there is variation among them, and compared to other regions, the generosity may not always stand out as the most significant.

Given these considerations, the claim could be seen as overly broad and lacking specific evidence to fully support it.

1. **Cost of Shooting and Murder Rate in 2016**: The claim states that the cost was about $9.6 billion. This figure would likely include direct costs (medical, police, etc.) and indirect costs (loss of productivity, emotional distress, etc.). While specific studies might provide such estimates, verifying this exact figure would require access to those studies.

2. **City Budget for 2018**: The claim states that the entire city budget for 2018 was $8.6 billion. This is a more straightforward figure to verify through publicly available budget documents.

Assuming the figures are accurate based on the provided context, the claim suggests that the cost of shootings and murders exceeded the city's entire budget, which is a significant financial burden.

**Evaluation**:
- If the cost of shootings and murders is indeed $9.6 billion and the city budget is $8.6 billion, the claim that this financial burden is ""killing our city"" is plausible.
- However, without verification of the exact figures from reliable sources, the claim's accuracy is somewhat uncertain.

1. **Source Verification:** The claim should ideally be backed by data from a reputable source, such as a government report, a credible study, or a recognized institution in the field of education or agriculture.

2. **Comparative Data:** To assert that this is the ""highest percentage in the country,"" there needs to be comparative data from other states to support this claim.

3. **Timeliness:** The data should be recent to ensure the claim reflects the current situation.

Without access to specific reports or studies that verify these details, it's challenging to definitively confirm the claim.

1. **Current Debt and Interest Rates**: As of my last update in October 2023, the U.S. national debt is substantial, and interest payments on this debt have been increasing. Interest rates can fluctuate, and any significant rise in rates would increase the cost of servicing the debt.

2. **National Defense Budget**: The U.S. national defense budget is one of the largest components of federal spending. For the fiscal year 2023, the defense budget was approximately $700 billion.

3. **Projections**: Economic projections suggest that interest payments on the national debt could indeed rise significantly over the next few years, especially if interest rates increase or the debt continues to grow.

Given these factors, while it is plausible that interest payments could approach the level of defense spending, the exact timing and magnitude of this convergence are uncertain and depend on various economic and policy factors.

"Every 1 percent increase in the cost of health insurance today causes about 30,000 Georgians to be uninsured.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the data sources that might support or refute it. The claim suggests a direct correlation between a 1 percent increase in health insurance costs and the number of uninsured individuals in Georgia.

Here are some factors to consider:

1. **Data Source**: The claim should be backed by credible data from reputable sources such as government reports, academic studies, or reliable surveys.
2. **Correlation vs Causation**: The claim implies a causal relationship. We need to ensure that the correlation is not coincidental and that there is a clear mechanism explaining how the increase in cost leads to a specific number of uninsured individuals.
3. **Magnitude of Impact**: The claim specifies that a 1 percent increase leads to 30,000 more uninsured individuals. This specificity requires precise data to support it.

Without specific data or studies to verify the exact numbers, it's challenging to definitively say whether the claim is entirely true or false. However, it is plausible that higher health insurance costs could lead to more people being uninsured, but the exact numbers might vary.

Given these considerations, the claim is likely 'Half True'. It acknowledges a real phenomenon but may not be precise in its quantification.

Her plan would cost $400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs"" is a complex one that needs to be broken down for verification.

1. **620,000 Refugees**: Hillary Clinton proposed increasing the number of refugees the U.S. would accept, but the figure of 620,000 over her first term is an extrapolation that assumes a continuous rate of increase. The actual number proposed was to accept 65,000 refugees in the fiscal year 2016, with a goal of increasing that number. The 620,000 figure is a high-end estimate and not a confirmed plan.

2. **Screening and Vetting**: The claim that there would be ""no effective way to screen or vet them"" is misleading. The U.S. has a multi-step vetting process for refugees that includes background checks, interviews, and biometric screenings. While no system is foolproof, stating there is ""no effective way"" is an overstatement.

3. **Cost of $400 Billion**: The cost estimate of $400 billion for lifetime welfare and entitlement costs is highly speculative and not based on widely accepted economic analyses. The actual costs would depend on numerous factors, including the demographics of the refugees, their integration into the workforce, and the types of assistance they receive.

Given these points, the claim is a mix of speculation, extrapolation, and misleading information.

1. **President Bill Clinton's Tax Policy**: In 1993, President Clinton signed into law the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which raised the top marginal income tax rate from 31% to 39.6%.

2. **Economic Impact**: Following the tax increase, the U.S. economy experienced significant job growth. From 1993 to 2000, the U.S. economy added approximately 22.7 million jobs, and the unemployment rate decreased from around 7% to around 4%.

3. **Comparison to Obama's Proposal**: President Obama proposed raising the top tax rates back to the levels seen under Clinton, which were 39.6% for the highest income bracket.

Given the historical data, it is accurate to say that when President Clinton raised the top tax rates, the country did experience significant job growth. However, it's important to note that job growth can be influenced by a multitude of factors, not just tax rates.

1. **Percentage of Minimum Wage Earners**: The claim specifies that 4.7% of Virginians are minimum wage earners. This data point would need to be verified against reliable sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or other credible economic reports.

2. **Age Group**: The claim specifies that these minimum wage earners are over 25 years of age. This detail also needs verification to ensure that the percentage accurately reflects this age demographic.

3. **Full-Time Work**: The claim states that these individuals are working full-time, which is another point that requires validation.

4. **Raising a Family**: The claim includes the condition that these individuals are trying to raise a family. This is a more subjective criterion and harder to quantify, but it would still need to be substantiated by relevant data or surveys.

Without specific data to verify each of these points, the claim cannot be definitively classified as 'True' or 'False'.

In 2011, an investigation revealed widespread cheating on standardized tests, with teachers and administrators changing answers to inflate test scores. This scandal cast a shadow over the reported academic gains and led to numerous convictions, including several high-ranking officials within the district.

Given the mixed legacy of Beverly Hall's tenure, with both significant improvements in academic metrics and the serious ethical breach of the cheating scandal, the claim that she left the school district ""significantly better than she found it"" is partially true but significantly complicated by the scandal.

The poverty rates in America today aren’t much better than when we started the War on Poverty.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the poverty rates in America when the ""War on Poverty"" began in the 1960s with the poverty rates today.

The War on Poverty was initiated in 1964 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the official poverty rate in 1964 was around 19%. As of the most recent data available, the poverty rate in the United States has fluctuated but generally remained in the range of 10% to 15%. For example, in 2020, the official poverty rate was 11.4%.

While the poverty rate has decreased significantly from the 19% in 1964, it has not been eradicated and has shown fluctuations over the years. Therefore, the claim that poverty rates today aren't much better than when the War on Poverty started is not entirely accurate but also not entirely false.

Four million women have fallen into poverty in the last six years.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Four million women have fallen into poverty in the last six years,"" we would need to examine data from reliable sources such as government reports, economic studies, or reputable international organizations. Without specific data to reference, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can outline the general approach to verify such a claim:

1. **Check Official Reports**: Look at reports from government agencies, such as the Census Bureau or the Department of Labor in the United States, or similar organizations in other countries.
2. **Review Economic Studies**: Consult studies from think tanks, academic institutions, or international organizations like the World Bank or the United Nations.
3. **Analyze Trends**: Compare poverty rates and trends over the specified period to see if there has been a significant increase in the number of women living in poverty.

Given the lack of specific data in this interaction, I cannot provide a precise rating. However, if we were to consider the hypothetical scenario where such data is available and it shows a significant but not exact increase, the claim might be rated as 'Mostly True' or 'Half True' depending on the extent of the discrepancy.

Three in four low-income workers don’t have any paid sick days available.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Three in four low-income workers don’t have any paid sick days available,"" we need to consider data and research on this topic.

According to various studies and reports, such as those from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other reputable sources, a significant portion of low-income workers in the United States do not have access to paid sick leave. While the exact percentage can vary, multiple studies have indicated that around 75% of low-income workers lack paid sick days.

Given this background, the claim that ""Three in four low-income workers don’t have any paid sick days available"" is generally supported by available data.

"Donald Trump is ""against marriage equality. He wants to go back.""",true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Donald Trump is 'against marriage equality. He wants to go back,'"" we need to consider Trump's public statements and actions regarding same-sex marriage and LGBTQ+ rights.

### Background on Trump's Stance:
1. **Public Statements**: During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump made statements that were somewhat supportive of LGBTQ+ rights, though not consistently. For example, he stated that the issue of same-sex marriage was ""settled"" by the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.

2. **Policy and Actions**:
   - **Appointment of Judges**: Trump appointed several conservative judges, including Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, who have generally been viewed as more conservative on social issues, including LGBTQ+ rights.
   - **Transgender Military Ban**: Trump's administration implemented a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, which was seen as a setback for LGBTQ+ rights.
   - **Religious Freedom**: Trump has supported ""religious freedom"" measures that critics argue could be used to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals.

3. **Post-Presidency**: Since leaving office, Trump has not made significant public statements altering his previous stance on marriage equality.

### Analysis:
- **Support for Marriage Equality**: Trump has not explicitly called for the reversal of the Obergefell v. Hodges decision. He has generally acknowledged it as settled law.
- **Actions Against LGBTQ+ Rights**: His administration's policies, such as the transgender military ban and support for religious freedom measures, have been seen as anti-LGBTQ+.

### Conclusion:
The claim that ""Donald Trump is 'against marriage equality. He wants to go back'"" is not entirely accurate. While his administration's policies have been criticized for being anti-LGBTQ+, Trump has not explicitly advocated for reversing the legalization of same-sex marriage.

In 2011, a federal judge in San Antonio did issue a ruling that prohibited public prayer at a graduation ceremony. The judge warned that if the school district allowed prayers or religious messages, it could face contempt of court charges. However, the claim that the judge specifically threatened to put the superintendent in jail for using certain words or asking for a moment of silence is an exaggeration. The judge's warning was about the consequences of violating the court order, not about specific words or actions.

The median income in America has dropped by 10 percent in the last four years.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""The median income in America has dropped by 10 percent in the last four years,"" we need reliable data sources such as government statistics or economic reports. Without specific data, we cannot definitively label the claim as true or false. However, generally, median income trends are closely monitored, and significant drops like 10 percent over four years would be widely reported and analyzed.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, a cautious approach is to consider the claim as potentially exaggerated or inaccurate without verification. Therefore, the claim is likely not entirely true but not entirely false either.

Louie Gohmert, a Republican Representative from Texas, has made various public statements and has been known for making controversial comparisons. However, without a specific quote or context, it is challenging to verify the exact comparison mentioned in the claim.

Let's assume that the claim is based on a reported statement or interview where Gohmert made this comparison. If there is documented evidence from a reliable source that Gohmert explicitly compared the current general-in-charge in Egypt to George Washington, then the claim would be considered accurate.

However, without specific evidence or context, the claim cannot be fully verified. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be to consider it ""Half True"" unless further evidence is provided to confirm the exact comparison.

The Lincoln Memorial is a national monument operated by the National Park Service, which is a federal agency. The government can implement restrictions or closures for various reasons, including preservation, security, or public health concerns. However, without specific details on the current policies or regulations, it is challenging to definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known ... corporate profits are up.,true,en,"The claim ""Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known ... corporate profits are up"" can be evaluated based on economic data and trends. Generally, after a recession, especially a significant one, there is often a period of recovery where corporate profits rebound. This pattern has been observed in various economic cycles, including the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recovery.

While specific data would be needed to confirm the exact timing and extent of the increase in corporate profits, historical trends suggest that corporate profits do tend to recover and increase after a recession. Therefore, the claim is likely accurate but may require specific data to be fully verified.

"Gov. Rick Scott ""is trying to get a waiver under the federal health care law that would deny consumers in Florida the right to the $60 million in rebates they have from their own HMOs.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at the context and actions taken by Governor Rick Scott regarding the federal health care law and the rebates for consumers in Florida.

Governor Rick Scott has been known for his opposition to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. One of the provisions of the ACA is the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) rule, which requires insurance companies to spend a certain percentage of premium dollars on medical care and quality improvement activities. If insurers do not meet these standards, they must provide rebates to consumers.

The claim suggests that Governor Scott sought a waiver to deny consumers the rebates they were entitled to under the ACA. However, the specific details of such a waiver request and its impact on the $60 million in rebates are not provided in the claim itself.

Without concrete evidence that Governor Scott explicitly sought a waiver to deny these rebates, the claim cannot be fully substantiated. It is possible that Scott's opposition to the ACA and his actions could be interpreted in a way that aligns with the claim, but without direct evidence, the accuracy of the claim is uncertain.

Without specific information about the poll or survey that produced this figure, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, claims of such high consensus on politically contentious issues like DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) are often met with skepticism due to the polarized nature of the topic.

Given the lack of specific context or supporting data, it is reasonable to classify this claim as potentially overstated or misleading. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Sixty percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Sixty percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana,"" we need to look at recent and reliable polling data on the subject.

According to various reputable sources such as Gallup and Pew Research Center, support for legalizing marijuana has been steadily increasing over the years. For instance, a 2021 Gallup poll found that 68% of Americans supported legalizing marijuana, which is higher than the 60% mentioned in the claim. Similarly, a 2021 Pew Research Center survey indicated that 60% of Americans favored legalizing marijuana.

Given this data, the claim that ""Sixty percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana"" is accurate based on recent polls.

While it is true that many of these technologies have significant roots in American innovation, they are also the result of global contributions and international collaboration.

For example:
- **Mobile Phones**: While the first mobile phone call was made in the U.S., the technology has been developed and advanced through global efforts.
- **E-mail**: The concept and early implementations of e-mail have roots in U.S. research and development, but its widespread adoption and improvement have been global.
- **The Internet**: The foundation of the internet, ARPANET, was developed in the U.S., but its growth and development into the global network we know today have been driven by international contributions.
- **GPS**: The Global Positioning System was indeed developed by the U.S. military and is a significant American innovation.

While these technologies have strong ties to the U.S., their development and impact are global. Therefore, the claim is mostly true but not entirely accurate without acknowledging the global contributions.

"The federal ""limousine fleet has increased by 42 percent since Barack Obama took office.""",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""the federal 'limousine fleet has increased by 42 percent since Barack Obama took office,"" we need to consider several factors, including the source of the data, the definition of ""limousine fleet,"" and the timeframe covered.

1. **Source and Data**: The claim should be backed by reliable data, typically from government records or credible third-party analyses. Without specific data, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim.

2. **Definition of ""Limousine Fleet""**: The term ""limousine fleet"" could be interpreted differently. It might refer to luxury vehicles used by high-ranking officials, or it could include a broader range of government vehicles. Clarifying this definition is crucial for accurate assessment.

3. **Timeframe**: The claim refers to the period since Barack Obama took office, which spans from January 2009 to January 2017. Any increase in the fleet should be measured within this timeframe.

Without access to specific data and clarification on the definition of ""limousine fleet,"" it's difficult to definitively categorize the claim.

Let's assume the claim is based on reliable sources such as government reports, economic analyses, or independent studies.

If the overall tax burden in Wisconsin indeed decreased during the governor's tenure, the claim would be true or mostly true.

"Compact fluorescent light bulbs are ""toxic"" and ""not environmentally friendly.""",half true,en,"Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) contain a small amount of mercury, which is a toxic substance. This mercury can pose a health risk if the bulb is broken and the mercury vapor is inhaled or if it contaminates the environment. However, the amount of mercury in CFLs is quite small, typically around 4 milligrams or less.

On the other hand, CFLs are more energy-efficient than traditional incandescent bulbs, which means they use less electricity and thus contribute less to greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Additionally, the use of mercury in CFLs is regulated, and many countries have recycling programs to safely dispose of these bulbs.

Given these points, the claim that CFLs are ""toxic"" is true to an extent due to the presence of mercury, but the claim that they are ""not environmentally friendly"" is mostly false because their energy efficiency outweighs the environmental impact of the small amount of mercury they contain, especially when properly recycled.

2. **Verify Actions**: Look into official records or news reports to confirm whether Knopp did not join PERS after taking office.

Without this specific information, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it can be verified through the methods mentioned, it could fall into one of the following categories:

- **True**: If there is clear evidence that Knopp made the promise and upheld it.

2. **Emergency Waivers**: Have these districts indeed requested emergency waivers specifically for increasing elementary school class sizes?
3. **Fiscal Challenges**: Is the reason for these requests cited as ""unprecedented fiscal challenges""?

Without specific data or sources to verify each of these points, we can make an educated guess based on typical scenarios and reporting trends. However, for a precise evaluation, we would need to consult official reports, statements from the Texas Education Agency, or other credible sources.

3. **The changed law allowed offenders to be kicked out of the classroom.**

Let's analyze each part:

1. **Tony Evers was unable to revoke a teacher's license for viewing pornography due to the law.**
   - This part of the claim suggests that there was a legal limitation preventing Evers from revoking the teacher's license. This is a specific factual claim that can be verified by checking the relevant laws and regulatory frameworks in place at the time.

2. **Tony Evers worked with lawmakers from both parties to change the law.**
   - This part of the claim suggests bipartisan cooperation to change the law. This can be verified by looking at legislative records, statements from lawmakers, and news reports from the time.

3. **The changed law allowed offenders to be kicked out of the classroom.**
   - This part of the claim suggests that the law was successfully changed to allow for the removal of offending teachers. This can be verified by examining the new legislation and its impact.

Without specific evidence or sources to corroborate each part of the claim, it is difficult to assign a definitive truth value.

- Reduce staffing ratios for nurses,
- Increase workload without adequate support,
- Cut funding for nursing education or training,
- Impose burdensome regulations that hinder nurses' ability to provide care,

then the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

If the bill includes mixed provisions, some of which support nursing care and others that hinder it, the claim might be 'Half True'.

If the bill primarily includes provisions that support or do not significantly impact nursing care, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend.,mostly true,en,"The claim that ""3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend"" is a complex one that requires examination of relevant data. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other sources, intimate partner violence is a significant issue in the United States. However, the exact number of women murdered by their partners each day can vary.

Based on available data, it is estimated that a significant number of women are indeed murdered by their intimate partners each year. The number can fluctuate, but it is generally in the range that supports the claim of around 3 women per day.

Given this information, the claim is not entirely false but may not be perfectly accurate every single day. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

"Says he ""made St. Petersburg the state's best maintained large sewer system in 2007.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that someone ""made St. Petersburg the state's best maintained large sewer system in 2007,"" we would need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Who is making the claim and what is their role or authority in the matter?
2. **Evidence**: What evidence supports the claim? Are there independent studies, reports, or awards that validate this achievement?
3. **Comparison**: How does St. Petersburg's sewer system compare to other large sewer systems in the state in 2007?
4. **Timeline**: Was the improvement specifically due to the actions of the individual making the claim during the specified time frame?

Without specific evidence or data to support the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that there is some evidence but it is not overwhelmingly conclusive or widely recognized, a reasonable assessment might be:

"His new running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a plan that would let Governor Romney pay less than 1 percent in taxes each year.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the context and details of Congressman Ryan's tax plan and how it would affect Governor Romney's taxes.

Congressman Paul Ryan proposed a tax reform plan that included significant changes to the tax code. One of the key elements of his plan was to consolidate the existing six tax brackets into two brackets with rates of 10% and 25%. Additionally, the plan proposed to eliminate many tax deductions and credits, which could potentially lower the effective tax rate for high-income individuals.

However, the claim that Governor Romney would pay less than 1 percent in taxes each year under Ryan's plan is likely an exaggeration. While the plan could lower Romney's effective tax rate, it is unlikely that it would drop to less than 1 percent. The specific details of Romney's income and the application of Ryan's plan would be necessary to make an exact determination, but based on available information, the claim seems to overstate the impact.

"The Obama White House recognizes a ""baby that has not been born"" for security purposes.",mostly false,en,"The claim that 'The Obama White House recognizes a ""baby that has not been born"" for security purposes' seems to be addressing a specific context, which is likely related to policies or statements made regarding the protection of unborn children or fetuses. To evaluate the truthfulness of this claim, we would need to examine specific policies, statements, or actions taken by the Obama administration.

Without specific evidence or context, it is difficult to definitively categorize this claim. However, generally, the Obama administration did not have explicit policies that recognized unborn babies for security purposes in the same way they recognized born individuals. The administration's stance on issues related to unborn children was more aligned with supporting reproductive rights and access to healthcare rather than recognizing unborn babies for security purposes.

Therefore, based on the general understanding of the Obama administration's policies, the claim is likely exaggerated or misleading.

"The 2009 stimulus bill ""failed to get people back to work.""",false,en,"The 2009 stimulus bill, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), was designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs during the Great Recession. The effectiveness of the ARRA in getting people back to work has been a subject of debate among economists and policymakers.

According to various studies, including those by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and independent economists, the ARRA did have a positive impact on job creation and helped mitigate the effects of the recession. However, it is also acknowledged that the recovery was slower than anticipated, and unemployment rates remained high for an extended period.

Given the mixed outcomes and the complex nature of economic recovery, it is fair to say that the claim that the 2009 stimulus bill ""failed to get people back to work"" is not entirely accurate but does capture some of the criticisms leveled against it.

U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2005 to 2013. During his tenure, he sponsored several bills, but the claim focuses on the number of bills that were actually passed into law. According to legislative records, Mack sponsored a total of 51 bills during his time in Congress. Of these, only one bill was enacted into law: H.R. 4118, the ""United States-Israel Rocket and Missile Defense Cooperation and Support Act,"" which was signed into law in 2012.

Given this information, the claim that Connie Mack IV passed ""only one bill"" in seven years is accurate.

"Since being elected, (Tom Barrett) has dumped 8.2 billion gallons of raw sewage into Lake Michigan.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim that Tom Barrett has dumped 8.2 billion gallons of raw sewage into Lake Michigan since being elected, we need to consider multiple factors, including the accuracy of the volume cited, the specific timeframe during his tenure, and the context of sewage management in the region.

Without specific data and context, it is difficult to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false. However, it is important to note that sewage overflows are often a result of infrastructure issues and heavy rainfall, and they occur in many cities with combined sewer systems. The claim may be exaggerating or misrepresenting the role of a single individual in a complex system governed by multiple factors.

Given the lack of specific data and the potential for misrepresentation, a reasonable assessment would be:

The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) did include a temporary fee to help fund the Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) and other provisions related to covering individuals with pre-existing conditions. This fee was indeed implemented, but it was not a flat $63 charge for every American. Instead, it was a fee assessed on health insurance plans, which could potentially be passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums. The fee was in effect from 2014 to 2016 and varied based on the type of health plan.

Given the nuances and the fact that the fee was not a direct charge to every American, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Says Newt Gingrich is responsible for the gridlocked politics of Washington.,half true,en,"Evaluating the claim that ""Newt Gingrich is responsible for the gridlocked politics of Washington"" requires considering the historical context and Gingrich's influence on political dynamics. Newt Gingrich, who served as Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999, is often credited with introducing more partisan and confrontational tactics into U.S. politics. His ""Contract with America"" and his approach to governing contributed to a more divisive political environment.

However, attributing all gridlock in Washington solely to Gingrich oversimplifies a complex issue. Political gridlock is influenced by numerous factors, including partisan polarization, the structure of the U.S. political system, and the actions of many other politicians and institutions over time. While Gingrich's actions certainly played a role, it would be inaccurate to claim he is solely responsible.

"The White House staff risks violating federal ethics rules if they participate in Donald Trump’s ""fake news awards.""",true,en,"The claim that White House staff risks violating federal ethics rules if they participate in Donald Trump’s ""fake news awards"" is complex and depends on specific ethics regulations and the nature of their participation. However, generally speaking, federal ethics rules prohibit government employees from using their official positions for partisan political purposes or activities that could be seen as endorsing or participating in political events.

Given that the ""fake news awards"" were a political activity initiated by a political figure, involvement by White House staff could potentially be seen as a violation of these ethics rules. Therefore, the claim has a significant basis in the ethical guidelines that apply to federal employees.

The seed of Muslim is passed through the father.,mostly false,en,"The statement ""The seed of Muslim is passed through the father"" is a complex one that involves both cultural and religious interpretations. In Islam, religious identity is typically passed down through the father, meaning that if the father is Muslim, the children are generally considered Muslim as well. However, this is not a universally accepted or strictly enforced rule, and there are varying interpretations and practices among different Muslim communities.

Given this nuance, the claim can be considered mostly true but not absolutely true in all cases.

We cut property taxes by one-third.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""We cut property taxes by one-third,"" we would need to examine the specific context and evidence supporting this assertion. Without additional information or data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume we have access to relevant data and analysis.

If the data shows that property taxes were indeed reduced by approximately 33.3%, then the claim would be considered accurate. If the reduction was significant but not exactly one-third, it might be labeled as ""Mostly True."" If the reduction was only minor or not widespread, it could be ""Half True"" or ""Mostly False."" If there was no reduction at all, the claim would be ""False.""

Without specific data, I'll provide a hypothetical evaluation based on common scenarios:

1. **True**: If credible sources confirm a reduction of exactly one-third.
2. **Mostly True**: If the reduction was close to one-third but not exactly.
3. **Half True**: If there was a reduction, but it was significantly less than one-third.
4. **Mostly False**: If the reduction was minimal or applied to a very small portion of properties.
5. **False**: If there was no reduction in property taxes.

Final Answer: Without specific data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on common evaluations, it could range from 'Mostly True' to 'False' depending on the actual reduction and its scope.",,False,True
Withheld union dues fund half of Dem (Democratic) campaigns in Florida.,false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Withheld union dues fund half of Dem (Democratic) campaigns in Florida,"" we need to consider the following points:

1. **Union Dues and Political Contributions:** Union dues are typically used for various purposes, including administrative costs, member services, and political activities. However, the proportion of dues that goes directly to political campaigns is not usually half.

2. **Transparency and Reporting:** Political contributions from unions are subject to disclosure laws, and detailed reports are available from sources like the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and state campaign finance agencies.

3. **Campaign Funding Sources:** Democratic campaigns in Florida, like any political campaigns, receive funding from multiple sources, including individual donors, political action committees (PACs), and party committees. It is unlikely that union dues alone would account for half of the funding.

4. **Fact-Checking Resources:** Reputable fact-checking organizations, such as PolitiFact or FactCheck.org, often review claims about campaign funding and can provide more specific data on the percentages of funding from different sources.

Given these points, the claim that withheld union dues fund half of Democratic campaigns in Florida is highly unlikely to be accurate. The proportion of funding from union dues is likely to be significantly lower than half.

"Under the Affordable Care Act, ""some people were gaming the system"" by paying ""for nine months of insurance, get 12 -- the other three for free.""",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Paying for nine months of insurance, getting three months free**: This refers to a feature of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) where individuals could enroll in health insurance during a specific open enrollment period and then cancel their plan before the end of the year, effectively paying for only a part of the year while still having coverage for the entire year if they timed it right.

2. **Gaming the system**: The term ""gaming the system"" suggests that people were taking advantage of a loophole in the ACA to avoid paying for a full year of insurance.

The claim is partially true because the ACA did allow for open enrollment periods and special enrollment periods, which could be used strategically to minimize premium payments. However, it's important to note that the ACA included provisions to discourage this behavior, such as penalties for not having continuous coverage.

Georgia’s civil forfeiture laws are among the worst in the country and the very worst in the South.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Georgia’s civil forfeiture laws are among the worst in the country and the very worst in the South,"" we need to consider the standards and criteria used to assess civil forfeiture laws. Organizations like the Institute for Justice (IJ) often rank states based on factors such as the ease of forfeiture, the standard of proof required, and the incentives for law enforcement to seize property.

According to the Institute for Justice's report on civil forfeiture laws, Georgia's laws are indeed considered some of the worst in the country. Factors contributing to this include:

1. **Ease of Forfeiture**: Georgia requires a lower standard of proof for forfeiture compared to many other states.
2. **Incentives for Law Enforcement**: Law enforcement agencies in Georgia often receive a significant portion of the proceeds from forfeited property, creating an incentive for seizures.
3. **Burden of Proof**: The burden of proof often falls on the property owner to prove their innocence, rather than on the government to prove guilt.

Given these factors, the claim that Georgia's civil forfeiture laws are among the worst in the country and the very worst in the South is substantiated by reputable sources and analyses.

"After Arizona banned smoking in ""all public places"" in 2007, ""admissions for acute myocardial infarction … stroke, asthma, [and] angina decreased following the implementation of the ban.""",half true,en,"The claim that after Arizona banned smoking in ""all public places"" in 2007, ""admissions for acute myocardial infarction … stroke, asthma, [and] angina decreased following the implementation of the ban"" is generally supported by research on the impacts of smoking bans. Studies have shown that such bans can lead to reductions in hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases due to decreased exposure to secondhand smoke.

For example, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that comprehensive smoking bans, like the one implemented in Arizona, were associated with significant reductions in hospital admissions for heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory diseases.

However, without specific data on Arizona's exact outcomes, it is challenging to confirm the claim with absolute certainty. Nonetheless, the general trend observed in similar situations supports the claim.

"Richard Cordray’s nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau marks the first time in Senate history ""that a political party has blocked a nomination of someone because they didn't like the construction of the agency.""",true,en,"The claim that Richard Cordray's nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau marks the first time in Senate history ""that a political party has blocked a nomination of someone because they didn't like the construction of the agency"" is mostly accurate but requires some context for full clarity.

The Republican Party did indeed block Cordray's nomination, primarily due to their opposition to the structure and powers of the CFPB itself, rather than Cordray's personal qualifications. This was a significant and notable instance of a nomination being blocked due to disagreements over the agency's construction. However, it is important to note that such actions, while rare, are part of the broader political dynamic in the Senate, where nominations can be held up for various reasons, including objections to the agency's structure or policies.

"We spent approximately $20-billion of that money on pork barrel, earmark projects.

To evaluate the claim accurately, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of Terms**:
   - **Pork Barrel Projects**: These are government spending projects intended to benefit a politician's constituents in return for their political support.
   - **Earmarks**: These are provisions in legislation that allocate funds to specific projects or programs.

2. **Fact Checking**:
   - The claim mentions a specific amount of money, $20 billion, being spent on pork barrel and earmark projects.
   - The implication is that some of this money could have been used to inspect bridges and other infrastructure.

3. **Verification**:
   - Verifying the exact amount spent on pork barrel and earmark projects requires access to government budget documents and reports.
   - Determining whether this money could have been better used for infrastructure inspections involves assessing the priorities and effectiveness of government spending.

Without specific data to verify the $20 billion figure and the potential reallocation of funds, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, the general premise that funds allocated to pork barrel projects could be better used for infrastructure is a common argument in discussions about government spending.

**Final Answer: Half True**

The claim has elements of truth in that government spending on pork barrel and earmark projects is a known issue, and there is a valid argument that funds could be redirected to infrastructure needs. However, without specific data to verify the $20 billion figure and the potential impact on infrastructure inspections, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.",half true,False,False
"Says Donald Trump ""wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Donald Trump 'wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare,'"" we need to consider the context and any available evidence. BadgerCare is a healthcare program in Wisconsin that provides coverage to low-income families and children.

The claim likely refers to policy proposals or actions by the Trump administration that could affect healthcare programs like BadgerCare. However, without specific evidence or policy documents that explicitly state Trump's intent to remove thousands of kids from BadgerCare, the claim is difficult to verify as entirely true.

Given the lack of direct evidence and the potential for misinterpretation or exaggeration, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true. It falls somewhere in between, suggesting that there may be some basis for the claim but not enough to confirm it outright.

"Savannah is home to ""the fastest-growing port in the nation.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that Savannah is home to ""the fastest-growing port in the nation,"" we would need to consider recent data on port growth rates, including metrics such as cargo volume, container throughput, and infrastructure expansion.

According to various reports, the Port of Savannah has indeed seen significant growth in recent years. The Georgia Ports Authority, which manages the Port of Savannah, has reported substantial increases in container volumes and investments in infrastructure. However, determining if it is truly the ""fastest-growing"" requires a comparison with other major ports in the U.S., such as the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach.

While the Port of Savannah has shown impressive growth, it is not consistently ranked as the fastest-growing port in the nation across all metrics and time frames. Therefore, while the claim has some truth to it, it may not be entirely accurate without qualification.

"Says Sen. Mark Begich is ineffective because he has only ""passed one bill, the naming of a building.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that Sen. Mark Begich is ineffective because he has only ""passed one bill, the naming of a building,"" we need to consider the context and the typical work of a senator.

1. **Context of Bill Passage**: Senators often introduce many bills, but the passage of a bill into law depends on various factors, including bipartisan support, committee processes, and the political climate.

2. **Types of Bills**: Naming buildings is a common and relatively straightforward type of bill. However, it does not necessarily reflect the totality of a senator's work or effectiveness. Senators also work on amendments, co-sponsorships, and behind-the-scenes negotiations that may not result in their name being directly attached to passed legislation.

3. **Effectiveness**: Effectiveness in the Senate can be measured by various metrics, including committee work, constituent services, and advocacy for state interests, not solely by the number of bills passed.

Given these points, the claim oversimplifies the role and effectiveness of a senator by focusing narrowly on the passage of bills. While it may be true that Sen. Begich had only one bill passed that specifically named a building, this does not provide a complete picture of his effectiveness.

We have 650 people who move to Texas every day.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""650 people move to Texas every day,"" we need to consider recent data on population growth and migration patterns in Texas.

According to various sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau and other demographic studies, Texas has been experiencing significant population growth, with a substantial number of people moving to the state each day. While the exact number can vary, recent estimates often place the daily influx of new residents in the range of several hundred to over a thousand.

Given this context, the claim of 650 people moving to Texas every day is within a plausible range based on available data. Therefore, while it may not be exactly 650 every single day, the claim is generally supported by the overall trend of high migration to Texas.

"Says Donald Trump wants to deport ""our Dreamers.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Donald Trump wants to deport 'our Dreamers,'"" we need to consider Trump's statements and policies regarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, often referred to as ""Dreamers.""

1. **Statements and Actions**: Trump has made various statements about DACA and Dreamers. At times, he has expressed sympathy for Dreamers and indicated a willingness to find a legislative solution for them. However, his administration also attempted to end the DACA program in 2017, which was blocked by the courts.

2. **Policy Intentions**: While Trump's administration sought to end DACA, the primary stated goal was to use it as a bargaining chip to secure funding for a border wall and other immigration reforms, rather than a direct intent to deport all Dreamers.

3. **Context**: The claim that Trump ""wants to deport 'our Dreamers'"" suggests a specific intent to remove Dreamers from the country, which is not fully supported by the range of his statements and actions. While his policies have put Dreamers at risk, they do not unequivocally demonstrate a singular desire to deport them.

Given these factors, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

1. **Empowerment of State Insurance Commissioners**: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) did give state insurance commissioners the authority to review and potentially reject unreasonable rate increases. This part of the claim is generally accurate.

2. **Specific Example of North Carolina**: The claim states that North Carolina has used this authority to roll back premium increases by 25 percent. This specific assertion needs to be verified with actual data or reports from North Carolina's insurance commissioner or relevant regulatory bodies.

Without specific data to confirm the 25 percent rollback in North Carolina, we can only partially verify the claim. The empowerment of state insurance commissioners is true, but the specific example provided lacks sufficient evidence to be fully validated.

To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the official unemployment rate and the broader measures of unemployment that include discouraged workers, marginally attached workers, and those working part-time for economic reasons (often referred to as the U-6 rate).

As of the time this claim was likely made, the official unemployment rate (U-3) was indeed around 5.6 percent. The U-6 rate, which includes a broader range of unemployment and underemployment, was typically higher but not as high as 18 to 20 percent. It usually hovers around 10 to 12 percent during periods when the official rate is around 5.6 percent.

Given this context, the claim that real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent is an exaggeration and not supported by standard economic measures.

"Says ""at the state level we're spending more on tax expenditures than we are on public safety, health care and education combined.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we would need specific data on the state's budget allocations for tax expenditures, public safety, healthcare, and education. Without this data, we cannot definitively determine the truthfulness of the statement. However, based on general knowledge and trends, it is plausible that tax expenditures could be significant, but it is less likely that they exceed the combined spending on public safety, healthcare, and education. Therefore, without concrete data, a reasonable assumption would be that the claim is exaggerated.

We actually made history in 2010. We came the closest in 24 years to defeating Frank Pallone.,false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two key points: whether an election in 2010 came close to defeating Frank Pallone and whether this was the closest such attempt in 24 years.

1. **2010 Election Results**: In the 2010 election for New Jersey's 6th congressional district, Frank Pallone won with 55% of the vote, while his Republican challenger, Anna Little, received 43.5% of the vote. This was indeed a closer margin than in previous elections.

2. **Historical Context**: To determine if this was the closest in 24 years (since 1986), we need to look at the margins of victory in previous elections. Frank Pallone has been in office since 1988, and his margins of victory have typically been larger than the 11.5% margin in 2010.

Given these points, the claim that the 2010 election was the closest in 24 years to defeating Frank Pallone is generally accurate, though it's important to note the specific margins and historical context for full accuracy.

"In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping (the Islamic State’s) advance.",half true,en,"The claim that ""In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping (the Islamic State’s) advance"" is a complex one to evaluate without specific context or timeframe. However, based on historical events and general consensus:

- The U.S. played a significant role in the coalition efforts against the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria.
- The U.S. military provided air support, training, and advisory roles, which contributed to halting and reversing ISIS territorial gains.
- However, the success was also due to the efforts of local forces and international allies.

Given these points, the claim is largely accurate but overstates the sole role of the U.S., as the effort was a multinational one.

"Every single one of the 41 Republican senators who just blocked a raise in the minimum wage will receive a $2,800 cost-of-living adjustment on January 1, 2015.",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Minimum Wage Block**: The claim suggests that 41 Republican senators blocked a minimum wage increase. This part of the claim can be verified by checking Senate voting records.

2. **Cost-of-Living Adjustment**: The claim states that these senators will receive a $2,800 cost-of-living adjustment on January 1, 2015. This can be verified by checking the Senate's salary and benefits information for that year.

Without specific details on the vote and the cost-of-living adjustment for that year, a general understanding can be inferred:

- **Vote on Minimum Wage**: It is plausible that a vote on increasing the minimum wage was blocked by Republican senators, as such votes are publicly recorded.
- **Cost-of-Living Adjustment**: Members of Congress do receive annual cost-of-living adjustments, but the specific amount and timing would need to be confirmed.

Given these considerations, the claim likely has elements of truth but requires specific verification for precise accuracy. Therefore, without explicit data, the claim can be considered:

**Final Answer: Mostly True**",mostly true,False,False
Today almost half our debt is owned by foreigners.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Today almost half our debt is owned by foreigners,"" we need to examine the current data on U.S. debt ownership. As of recent data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, foreign investors hold a significant portion of U.S. debt, but it is not quite half. According to the most recent figures, foreign investors hold approximately 30-40% of U.S. public debt.

Given this information, the claim that ""almost half our debt is owned by foreigners"" is not entirely accurate but has some truth to it.

"Voter turnout in 2016 was reduced by approx. 200,000 votes because of WI’s photo ID laws.",mostly false,en,"The claim that ""Voter turnout in 2016 was reduced by approx. 200,000 votes because of WI’s photo ID laws"" is a complex one and has been the subject of various studies and debates. Several analyses suggest that Wisconsin's photo ID laws may have had an impact on voter turnout, but the exact number of votes affected is difficult to pinpoint and is not universally agreed upon.

Some studies have indicated that the photo ID laws may have deterred a significant number of voters, potentially in the range of tens of thousands, but the figure of 200,000 is not widely accepted as definitive. The lack of consensus and the variability in findings across different studies suggest that while there may have been an impact, the precise extent is uncertain.

Given the available evidence and the ongoing debate, the most accurate categorization of this claim would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the current legal and social landscape regarding gay marriage and civil unions in the United States. As of recent data, all 50 states in the U.S. recognize same-sex marriage due to the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015.

Given this context, the claim that ""Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions"" is somewhat misleading because it suggests that only a portion of the country is tolerant or supportive of these rights. In reality, same-sex marriage is legally recognized nationwide, indicating a broader acceptance than the claim implies.

Therefore, the claim is somewhat accurate in that it reflects a historical perspective before the legalization of same-sex marriage across all states, but it is not fully accurate given the current legal status.

"The truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop.",half true,en,"The claim that any oil drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, and thus would not reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil, is a complex one. While it's true that oil is a globally traded commodity and can be sold anywhere, increasing domestic oil production in the U.S. can lead to a decrease in net imports of oil. This is because refineries would have more domestic oil to process, which could reduce the need for foreign oil. However, the claim is also correct in noting that the oil could be exported.

Given these nuances, the claim is not entirely accurate, but it's not entirely false either. Therefore, the most fitting category would be:

"Sixteen thousand new Internal Revenue Service agents will be ""empowered to enforce"" the new health care legislation.",mostly false,en,"The claim that ""Sixteen thousand new Internal Revenue Service agents will be 'empowered to enforce' the new health care legislation"" is inaccurate and misleading. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) did not specifically hire 16,000 new IRS agents for enforcement. The number likely comes from a misinterpretation of a report that estimated the IRS might need to hire additional staff to manage new responsibilities related to the ACA, but the actual hiring was much lower and not exclusively for enforcement.

Salaries for URI faculty are second to last among New England land grant universities and in lowest 20 percent of major U.S. research institutions,half true,en,"To assess the claim accurately, we would need current and verifiable data on the salaries of faculty at the University of Rhode Island (URI) compared to other New England land grant universities and major U.S. research institutions. However, without specific data, we can make a general assessment based on typical trends and available public information.

Faculty salaries can vary widely based on several factors, including the specific field, the rank of the faculty member, and the funding available to the institution. Generally, claims about institutional rankings should be supported by comprehensive studies or reports from reputable sources.

If the claim is based on a credible study or report that provides detailed comparisons, it could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'True'. However, if the claim lacks specific data or if the data is outdated or not from a reliable source, it could be considered 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

Without access to the specific data, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the need for specific and reliable data to substantiate such a claim, a cautious approach would be to consider it 'Half True' until more concrete evidence is provided.

Our pension system is the only one in the country that’s 100 percent funded.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Our pension system is the only one in the country that’s 100 percent funded,"" we need to consider the following points:

1. **Verifiability**: The claim implies that the pension system in question is fully funded and that no other pension system in the country has this status.
2. **Context and Data**: Without specific data or context (e.g., the name of the country, the specific pension system being referred to, and current funding levels of other pension systems), it is difficult to verify the claim.
3. **General Knowledge**: In many countries, it is rare for a pension system to be 100% funded due to various financial and demographic challenges.

Given the lack of specific data and the general rarity of fully funded pension systems, the claim is likely exaggerated or inaccurate without further evidence.

"I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere.",half true,en,"The claim ""I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere"" is often associated with former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. However, the accuracy of this statement has been widely debated. Initially, Palin supported the Bridge to Nowhere project, but later she did express opposition to it. Therefore, while she did eventually oppose the project, the claim that she outright rejected it from the start is not entirely accurate.

Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island’s sales tax.,false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island’s sales tax,"" we need to consider the types of goods and services that are typically subject to sales tax and those that are exempt.

In Rhode Island, as in many other states, certain essential items such as groceries, prescription medications, and some services are often exempt from sales tax. However, the exact percentage of purchases that are subject to sales tax can vary based on consumer spending habits and the specific exemptions in the state's tax code.

Without specific data from a reliable source, it is challenging to definitively say whether exactly 25 percent of purchases are subject to sales tax. However, it is reasonable to assume that a significant portion of consumer spending is not subject to sales tax due to exemptions.

Given this context, the claim that ""Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island’s sales tax"" is likely an oversimplification and may not be entirely accurate without supporting data. Therefore, the claim can be considered:

Final Answer: Mostly False.",mostly false,False,False
"Gov. Roy Cooper has ""filed nearly one lawsuit a month, with every single one of them an attempt to extend his own power.""",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Gov. Roy Cooper has filed nearly one lawsuit a month, with every single one of them an attempt to extend his own power,"" we need to consider the frequency of lawsuits filed by Gov. Cooper and the motives behind them.

Firstly, the claim suggests a very high frequency of lawsuits, nearly one per month. This would imply a significant number of legal actions over a given period. Without specific data on the number of lawsuits filed by Gov. Cooper, it is challenging to verify the frequency aspect of the claim.

Secondly, the claim asserts that every lawsuit was an attempt to extend his own power. This is a subjective assessment that would require analyzing the nature and intent of each lawsuit. Governors may file lawsuits for a variety of reasons, including defending state laws, challenging federal actions, or addressing constitutional issues.

Without detailed information on the number and nature of the lawsuits filed by Gov. Cooper, it is difficult to conclusively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, the sweeping assertion that every lawsuit was solely to extend his own power is likely an oversimplification.

Given the lack of specific data and the subjective nature of the claim, a balanced assessment would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**

This acknowledges that while there may have been a notable number of lawsuits, the motives behind them are likely more complex than simply extending personal power.",half true,False,False
Says Texas Department of Public Safety numbers show that 1.6 percent of crime is committed by unauthorized immigrants.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Texas Department of Public Safety numbers show that 1.6 percent of crime is committed by unauthorized immigrants,"" we need to consider the accuracy and context of the statement.

1. **Source Verification**: The claim references the Texas Department of Public Safety, which is a credible source for crime statistics in Texas.

2. **Specificity of Data**: The claim specifies a percentage (1.6 percent) and a particular group (unauthorized immigrants).

3. **Context and Interpretation**: The accuracy of the claim depends on whether the 1.6 percent figure is correctly cited from the Texas Department of Public Safety and whether it is interpreted in the proper context.

Without access to the specific report or data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, we cannot definitively verify the exact percentage. However, assuming the claim accurately reflects the data provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety, it would likely be considered accurate.

Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:

1. **Identify the Source**: Determine where the claim originated and whether it comes from a credible source.
2. **Check Factual Information**: Verify if Richard Cordray indeed directed an Ohio commission to permit an armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds.
3. **Look for Official Statements**: Check for official statements or records that confirm or deny the action taken by Richard Cordray.
4. **Cross-Reference with Other Sources**: Compare the claim with reports from multiple reliable news outlets or official documents.
5. **Assess the Action**: Determine if Cordray personally waived an insurance requirement and assumed responsibility.

Without specific evidence or context, it's challenging to definitively classify the claim. However, based on the typical procedures for verifying such claims:

- **True**: If multiple credible sources confirm that Richard Cordray took these actions.
- **Mostly True**: If the claim is largely accurate but may have minor inaccuracies or omissions.
- **Half True**: If the claim contains significant elements of truth but also has significant errors or omissions.
- **Mostly False**: If the claim contains some element of truth but is mostly inaccurate.
- **False**: If the claim is entirely inaccurate or fabricated.

Given the limited information provided, a general assessment would lean towards 'Half True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the specific details and context that can be verified.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government cannot withhold funding unrelated to a state or local government's noncompliance with federal law. Specifically, in cases like South Dakota v. Dole (1987) and NFIB v. Sebelius (2012), the Court has established that federal funding conditions must be related to the purpose of the funding and cannot be unduly coercive.

Therefore, while a president might be able to withhold specific grants related to immigration enforcement, they cannot cut off all federal funding to sanctuary cities.

"Says Jeanne Shaheen ""voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax.""",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim that Jeanne Shaheen ""voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax,"" we need to examine her voting record and the specifics of the measure in question. Without additional context or specific details about the vote, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we are referring to a well-known vote on a cap-and-trade bill or a similar energy policy that could be construed as a ""national energy tax.""

If Jeanne Shaheen did indeed vote for such a measure, the claim would likely be considered accurate, although the interpretation of the measure as a ""tax"" could be debated. Cap-and-trade systems, for example, are often described by opponents as a tax, while proponents may argue it is a market-based solution to reduce emissions.

Given the complexity and the potential for differing interpretations, a reasonable assessment might be:

"Says Charlie Crist ""is embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim that Charlie Crist ""is embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Legal Involvement**: Is Charlie Crist currently involved in a legal case related to fraud?
2. **Role in the Scheme**: Did Charlie Crist steer taxpayer money to a scheme that is considered a Ponzi scheme?
3. **Evidence and Context**: What is the evidence supporting these claims, and what is the context surrounding them?

Without specific details or evidence to support the claim, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the general principles of truth evaluation in journalism and fact-checking:

- If there is clear evidence that Charlie Crist is involved in a legal case related to fraud and that he steered taxpayer money to a Ponzi scheme, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the claim is partially accurate but exaggerated or lacking in key details, it would be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.
- If the claim is mostly inaccurate or misleading, it would be 'Mostly False'.

While the Cash for Clunkers program and the first-time home buyer tax credit did have an impact on GDP growth, they were not the sole contributors. Other factors, such as increased consumer spending and business investment, also played a role. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but has some truth to it.

Without specific details or quotes, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is about a political figure who has made contradictory statements about leaving residual forces in Iraq, we can analyze it based on typical patterns of political speech.

If the individual initially stated that they would leave residual forces in Iraq and later stated that they wouldn't, this would indicate a clear contradiction in their position. Such a reversal could be due to various factors, such as a change in circumstances, new information, or political expediency.

Given the information provided, the claim seems to suggest a significant change in stance, which could be considered a substantial shift rather than a minor adjustment.

"George Allen voted for budgets that increased the national debt by $16,400 for every second he served in the U.S. Senate.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""George Allen voted for budgets that increased the national debt by $16,400 for every second he served in the U.S. Senate,"" we need to break down the statement and analyze the available data.

1. **Term of Service**: George Allen served in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2007, which is a total of 6 years.

2. **National Debt Increase**: During his term, the national debt increased significantly. According to historical data, the national debt rose from approximately $5.8 trillion at the beginning of 2001 to about $9 trillion by the end of 2006. This is an increase of roughly $3.2 trillion over 6 years.

3. **Calculation per Second**:
   - There are 31,536,000 seconds in a year (365 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds).
   - Over 6 years, there are 189,216,000 seconds.
   - The increase in national debt per second would be $3.2 trillion / 189,216,000 seconds.

4. **Actual Increase per Second**:
   - $3.2 trillion = $3,200,000,000,000.
   - $3,200,000,000,000 / 189,216,000 seconds ≈ $16,916 per second.

The claim states $16,400 per second, which is very close to the calculated value of approximately $16,916 per second.

Given the proximity of the figures, the claim can be considered mostly accurate, although not perfectly precise.

"Says Merrick Garland ""authored an opinion that resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists the State Department had designated as terrorists.""",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components:

1. Merrick Garland authored an opinion.
2. The opinion resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners.
3. The prisoners were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists.
4. The State Department had designated them as terrorists.

Merrick Garland, as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, indeed authored opinions related to Guantanamo Bay detainees. One notable case is ""Parhat v. Gates"" (2008), where Garland wrote an opinion that led to the release of a detainee. However, the claim that his opinion resulted in the release of 17 prisoners is not accurate. The release of detainees from Guantanamo Bay has been a complex process involving multiple court decisions, political negotiations, and administrative reviews.

Moreover, while many Guantanamo Bay detainees have been associated with extremist groups, not all have been formally designated as terrorists by the State Department. The designation process is specific and does not apply to every detainee.

Given these points, the claim is an exaggeration and oversimplification of a complex legal and political process.

"Says Indiana Gov. Mike Pence ""provides zero state funding for homeless shelters.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence ""provides zero state funding for homeless shelters,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of state funding policies during his tenure.

While it is true that direct state funding specifically earmarked for homeless shelters might not be explicitly outlined, it is crucial to consider that state funding for social services often flows through various programs and agencies that ultimately support homeless shelters. For example, funding might come from broader social service programs, grants, or community development initiatives that indirectly support homeless shelters.

Without specific data or a detailed analysis of Indiana's budget allocations under Mike Pence, it is difficult to definitively say whether the claim is entirely false or true. However, given the complexity of state budgets and the various ways funding can be allocated, it is likely that some form of state funding indirectly supports homeless shelters.

Therefore, the claim that Mike Pence provides zero state funding for homeless shelters is likely an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.

The number of terrorists out there has doubled.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""The number of terrorists out there has doubled,"" we need reliable data and context. Without specific data on the number of terrorists over time, it's challenging to verify this claim accurately. However, general trends and data from counter-terrorism agencies can provide some insight.

According to various reports, the global threat of terrorism has fluctuated over the years, with some regions experiencing increases while others have seen declines. For instance, the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) shows variations in terrorist activity, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a universal doubling of the number of terrorists.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to support a precise doubling of the number of terrorists globally, the claim is likely exaggerated. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

This administration is slashing the Navy to pay for more Obamacare.,false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""This administration is slashing the Navy to pay for more Obamacare,"" we need to examine the funding and policy decisions related to both the Navy and the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).

1. **Navy Funding**: The claim suggests that the Navy's budget is being cut significantly. However, historical budget data generally shows that defense spending, including the Navy's budget, has not been drastically reduced in ways that would support the term ""slashing."" Defense budgets typically fluctuate, but significant cuts to the Navy specifically to fund another program are not evident.

2. **Obamacare Funding**: The Affordable Care Act is funded through a combination of new taxes, penalties, and reallocations within the healthcare system. There is no direct evidence that the Navy's budget is being reduced to specifically fund Obamacare.

3. **Budget Priorities**: While it is true that budgets are finite and decisions about spending in one area can affect others, linking a reduction in the Navy's budget directly to increased funding for Obamacare is not supported by available data or policy analysis.

Given these points, the claim that the administration is ""slashing the Navy to pay for more Obamacare"" is not accurate. The Navy's budget has not been significantly reduced in a way that would support the term ""slashing,"" and there is no direct linkage between Navy budget reductions and increased funding for Obamacare.

In many countries, including the United States, the absolute number of immigrants has indeed reached historic highs due to population growth and global migration trends. However, when considering the percentage of the population that immigrants represent, the numbers may not be the highest in history.

For example, in the United States, the number of immigrants has been increasing, but the percentage of the population that is foreign-born has fluctuated and was higher during certain periods in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

However, if there is evidence that Richard Corcoran has proposed policies that increase funding for private schools and if there are concerns or evidence that these private schools lack adequate accountability measures, the claim could be considered 'Half True' or 'Mostly True'. If the claim is entirely unsupported by any proposed policies or evidence, it could be considered 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt is unsustainable and it is unpayable. And the reason why it is unsustainable has everything to do with the greed of Wall Street vulture funds.,half true,en,"The statement has some truth to it, but it also simplifies a complex issue. Here's a breakdown:

- **True aspects**: Puerto Rico's debt is indeed significant and has been widely considered unsustainable. Some hedge funds, often referred to as ""vulture funds,"" have bought Puerto Rico's debt at discounted prices and pushed for repayment.

- **Simplifications/Omissions**: The statement attributes the unsustainability solely to Wall Street greed. While speculative investors have played a role, the debt crisis is also a result of various other factors, including Puerto Rico's long-standing economic woes, unfunded pensions, government mismanagement, and a lack of financial oversight.

Considering these points, the claim is partly accurate but oversimplifies the causes of the debt crisis.

Says combined inflation and unemployment rates in October 2011 were the highest since Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter.,false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""combined inflation and unemployment rates in October 2011 were the highest since Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter,"" we need to look at historical data for inflation and unemployment rates.

Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter in January 1981. To verify the claim, we need to compare the combined inflation and unemployment rates in October 2011 with the rates from January 1981 onwards.

### Data Points:
1. **Inflation and Unemployment in October 2011:**
   - Inflation rate: Approximately 3.5% (annual rate)
   - Unemployment rate: Approximately 9.0%

2. **Inflation and Unemployment in January 1981:**
   - Inflation rate: Approximately 11.3% (annual rate)
   - Unemployment rate: Approximately 7.5%

3. **Combined Rates:**
   - October 2011: 3.5% (inflation) + 9.0% (unemployment) = 12.5%
   - January 1981: 11.3% (inflation) + 7.5% (unemployment) = 18.8%

### Analysis:
- The combined rate in October 2011 was 12.5%.
- The combined rate in January 1981 was 18.8%.

Given these numbers, the combined inflation and unemployment rates in October 2011 were not the highest since Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter. The combined rates in January 1981 were significantly higher.

### Conclusion:
The claim is inaccurate based on the available data.

The (Wisconsin) governor has proposed tax giveaways to corporations.,mostly true,en,"To accurately assess this claim, I would need to review the specific proposals made by the Wisconsin governor. However, without that detailed information, I can provide a general framework for evaluating such a claim:

1. **True**: The governor has explicitly proposed tax cuts or incentives aimed directly at corporations.
2. **Mostly True**: The governor has proposed tax policies that primarily benefit corporations, but there might be some nuances or additional context.
3. **Half True**: The governor has proposed tax policies that could benefit corporations, but the benefits are not exclusive to them or are part of a broader policy.
4. **Mostly False**: The governor has proposed tax policies that do not primarily benefit corporations, or the benefits to corporations are minimal compared to other groups.
5. **False**: The governor has not proposed any tax policies that benefit corporations.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim, a cautious approach would be to consider it:

**Final Answer: Half True**

This assumes that the governor's proposals might include some benefits for corporations but are not exclusively targeted at them. For a more precise evaluation, specific details of the proposals would be necessary.",half true,False,False
"If you are a gun store owner and you decide to go out of business … you right now are allowed to convert your entire gun store inventory to ‘personal use’ and once it is a personal use weapon, you can sell it without background checks.",true,en,"The claim that a gun store owner can convert their entire inventory to personal use and then sell those firearms without background checks is not entirely accurate. While it is true that private sales (sales between individuals who are not licensed dealers) do not require background checks in many states, there are still legal considerations and potential restrictions.

For instance, federal law prohibits anyone from selling firearms to individuals they know or have reasonable cause to believe are prohibited from possessing firearms. Additionally, some states have implemented universal background check laws that require background checks for all firearm sales, including private sales.

Therefore, the claim oversimplifies the legal complexities and variations in state laws.

"Under Obamacare, ""premiums have doubled and tripled"" in Wisconsin.",mostly true,en,"The claim that ""Under Obamacare, 'premiums have doubled and tripled' in Wisconsin"" is a complex one and requires context to accurately assess.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Premium Increases**: It is true that, in some cases, health insurance premiums increased significantly after the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was implemented. This was due in part to the requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing conditions, which increased costs for insurers.

2. **Variability**: The extent of premium increases varied widely across different states and even within states. Some people saw much higher premiums, while others saw smaller increases or even decreases, especially if they qualified for subsidies.

3. **Subsidies**: The Affordable Care Act also introduced subsidies to help lower-income individuals and families afford health insurance, which offset the cost of premiums for many people.

4. **Market Stabilization**: Over time, premium increases have stabilized in many markets, and in some cases, premiums have even decreased.

Given these points, the claim that premiums have ""doubled and tripled"" in Wisconsin is overly broad and does not account for the variability in premium changes or the impact of subsidies. Therefore, while there is some truth to the claim, it oversimplifies a complex situation.

**Final Answer:** Half True",half true,False,False
"The polling shows over and over again that, unlike Donald Trump, that with me as the nominee, we beat Hillary Clinton.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the polling data available at the time the statement was made. While it's true that some polls might have shown the speaker (presumably a candidate other than Donald Trump) performing better against Hillary Clinton than Trump, polling data can vary and be interpretive based on the specific polls cited. Without specific polling data to verify the claim that the speaker consistently beats Hillary Clinton in polls, we cannot definitively say it's entirely true. Therefore, the claim is likely overstated.

"Before Act 10, the total cost of public sector employees’ employment was 29 percent higher than that in the private sector. After the act, it’s still 22 percent higher.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and data provided. The claim suggests that before Act 10, public sector employees' employment costs were 29 percent higher than those in the private sector, and after the act, they remained 22 percent higher.

Without specific data or sources to verify these percentages, it's challenging to determine the absolute truth of the claim. However, the claim does acknowledge a reduction in the disparity between public and private sector employment costs, which could suggest some level of accuracy in the trend.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm the exact percentages, but acknowledging the general trend described, the claim can be considered 'Half True'.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, it is known that several states have faced budget constraints and have considered or implemented cuts to public television funding.

Given the general trend of budget reductions affecting public services, including public television, in multiple states, the claim that ""We aren't the only state cutting back on public television"" is likely to be accurate.

Trump's Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan’s.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the demographic composition of Trump's Cabinet with those of previous presidents, specifically focusing on the cabinets of presidents since Ronald Reagan.

1. **Trump's Cabinet Composition**: Trump's initial Cabinet consisted predominantly of white males. Specifically, out of the 24 members (including Cabinet-level positions), there were only a few women and minorities.

2. **Historical Context**:
   - **Reagan's Cabinet**: Ronald Reagan's Cabinet was also predominantly white and male.
   - **Subsequent Presidents**: The cabinets of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama saw an increase in diversity, with more women and minorities in Cabinet positions.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Trump's Cabinet had fewer women and minorities compared to the cabinets of Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama.
   - The claim specifies ""more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan’s,"" which implies a comparison with the initial Cabinets of each president.

Based on the available data and historical context, the claim that ""Trump's Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan’s"" is accurate. Trump's Cabinet did have a higher proportion of white males compared to the initial cabinets of presidents since Reagan.

"After a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we would need specific data about the country in question and the time period mentioned. Without that context, I can't provide a precise answer. However, I can outline how such a claim could be evaluated:

1. **Identify the Country**: Determine which country the claim refers to.
2. **Verify the Time Period**: Confirm the specific two and a half years being referenced.
3. **Check Manufacturing Job Data**: Look at official statistics or reports from reliable sources (e.g., government labor bureaus, economic reports) to see if there was indeed an increase of over half a million manufacturing jobs during that period.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim, it's challenging to assign a definitive truth value. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data and sources, it could potentially be true.

"First, Donald Trump said wages are too high, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its two main parts:

1. **Donald Trump said wages are too high:**
   - During a Republican presidential debate in November 2015, Donald Trump did say, ""Wages are too high."" This statement was made in the context of discussing the potential impact of raising the minimum wage.

2. **Both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage:**
   - Donald Trump has made comments suggesting he is against raising the federal minimum wage, but he has not explicitly advocated for eliminating it. For example, he has stated that he believes the issue should be left to the states.
   - Mike Pence, during his time as governor of Indiana, did not support raising the minimum wage and has generally favored states' rights on the issue, but there is no clear evidence that he advocates for eliminating the federal minimum wage altogether.

Given this context, the claim that Donald Trump said wages are too high is accurate. However, the claim that both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage is not fully supported by their statements. They have expressed opposition to raising the federal minimum wage and have favored state control, but there is no clear evidence that they advocate for its elimination.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when (President Barack) Obama took office.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at the data on government employment during President Obama's tenure. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when Obama took office in January 2009, there were approximately 2.15 million federal employees. By the time he left office in January 2017, that number had decreased to around 2.08 million. This indicates a reduction of about 70,000 federal employees, not half a million.

Given this data, the claim that there are ""half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Obama took office"" is not accurate.

"Says Hillary Clinton's ""plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.""",mostly false,en,"The claim that Hillary Clinton's plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes is largely exaggerated and misleading. While Clinton's proposals included tax increases for the wealthy, the majority of Americans would not have seen a significant tax increase, and certainly not a doubling of their taxes. According to analyses by nonpartisan organizations like the Tax Policy Center, Clinton's tax plan primarily targeted high-income individuals and corporations, with minimal impact on middle and lower-income taxpayers.

"If you look at the states where soccer is most popular, they're overwhelmingly blue states, and the states where soccer is least popular are red states.",mostly true,en,"The claim that soccer is most popular in blue states and least popular in red states is a complex one that doesn't have a straightforward answer. Soccer's popularity in the United States is influenced by various factors, including demographics, youth participation, and the presence of professional teams, which don't neatly align with political leanings.

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Youth Participation**: Soccer is widely played by youth across the country, regardless of the state's political leaning.
2. **Professional Teams**: Many Major League Soccer (MLS) teams are based in cities in both blue and red states.
3. **Demographics**: Soccer's popularity among certain demographic groups, such as Hispanic communities, can influence its popularity in specific regions.

Given these factors, it's not accurate to say that soccer's popularity strictly follows political lines. While there may be some correlation due to demographic trends, it's not a strong enough pattern to label the claim as true.

"Two years ago Providence alone spent $50,000 a year notifying the school department about residents in the state's sex offender registry.",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Specificity**: The claim mentions a specific city (Providence), a specific amount ($50,000), and a specific task (notifying the school department about residents in the state's sex offender registry).
2. **Time Frame**: The claim refers to ""two years ago,"" which means we need to verify the information based on the data available from that time.
3. **Verifiability**: Without access to official records or a reliable source confirming the exact expenditure, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as 'True' or 'False.' However, the specificity of the claim suggests that it could be fact-checked against financial records from the city of Providence.

Given the specificity and the potential for verification, but without concrete evidence to confirm or deny the claim, the most reasonable assessment is that the claim is plausible but not definitively proven. Therefore, the claim can be considered 'Half True.'

"In 2012, ""Wall Street"" gave Scott Brown ""more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million.""",mostly true,en,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In 2012, 'Wall Street' gave Scott Brown 'more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million,'"" we need to consider the context and available data.

Scott Brown was a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts who ran for re-election in 2012. The claim suggests that he received more campaign contributions from the financial sector (often referred to as ""Wall Street"") than any other candidate in that election cycle.

According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance, Scott Brown did receive significant contributions from the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) sector. However, the claim that he received more than any other candidate in 2012 is not entirely accurate. Other candidates, such as Mitt Romney, received more from this sector overall during the 2012 election cycle.

While Scott Brown did receive substantial contributions from the financial sector, the claim overstates his position relative to other candidates. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

We've dropped from a top 10 state in elementary reading to 30th in the nation under State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers’ watch.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Data Source**: The claim should be verified using reliable data sources such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) or other recognized educational performance metrics.
2. **Time Frame**: The claim references the tenure of State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers, so we need to look at the data during his time in office.
3. **Ranking Changes**: We need to confirm whether the state's ranking in elementary reading has indeed dropped from the top 10 to 30th in the nation.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a precise answer. However, based on general knowledge and the need to verify such claims with official data, we can infer the following:

- If there is clear data showing a drop from the top 10 to 30th during Tony Evers' tenure, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the data shows a significant drop but not precisely from the top 10 to 30th, it might be 'Half True'.
- If the data does not support a significant drop or if the ranking change is not directly tied to Tony Evers' tenure, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, a conservative evaluation would be:

Casualties and deaths are at (their) lowest point since literally the beginning of the war.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Casualties and deaths are at (their) lowest point since literally the beginning of the war,"" we need to consider the context and available data on the specific war being referred to. Without specific data, it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume we are discussing a war with publicly available data on casualties and deaths.

1. **True**: This would mean that the data unequivocally shows that casualties and deaths are at the lowest point since the start of the war.
2. **Mostly True**: This would mean that while the data generally supports the claim, there might be minor discrepancies or exceptions.
3. **Half True**: This would mean that the data is mixed, with some periods showing lower casualties and deaths but not consistently at the lowest point.
4. **Mostly False**: This would mean that the data generally does not support the claim, but there might be some isolated instances that do.
5. **False**: This would mean that the data clearly contradicts the claim, showing that casualties and deaths are not at their lowest point.

Given the typical complexity and variability of war data, a claim that casualties and deaths are at their lowest point since the beginning of the war would likely fall into the category of **Mostly True** or **Half True**, depending on the specific data. Without specific data, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer, but based on general trends in war reporting, it is reasonable to assume there might be some discrepancies or exceptions.

"Says small businesses ""make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce"" and ""almost never receive a penny of government money.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into two parts:

1. **""Small businesses make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce.""**
2. **""Small businesses almost never receive a penny of government money.""**

### Part 1: Small Businesses Makeup and Employment
According to many economic reports, including those from the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses typically make up a significant majority of all businesses in a state and employ a substantial portion of the private sector workforce. While the exact percentages can vary, the claim that small businesses make up 98.9 percent of all businesses and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce is generally in line with widely accepted data.

### Part 2: Government Money to Small Businesses
The claim that small businesses ""almost never receive a penny of government money"" is more contentious. While it's true that many small businesses do not receive direct government funding, there are numerous government programs, loans, grants, and tax incentives designed to support small businesses. Examples include the Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, disaster relief grants, and various state-level programs.

### Conclusion
While the first part of the claim is generally accurate, the second part is misleading. Therefore, the overall claim is more accurately described as ""Half True.""

"Large majorities of the public ""oppose major changes to Medicare"" and favor higher taxes on the wealthy.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the available data and public opinion polls on these issues.

1. **Opposition to Major Changes to Medicare**:
   - Various polls, including those conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, have consistently shown that a large majority of Americans oppose significant changes to Medicare, especially if those changes involve cuts to benefits or increased costs for beneficiaries.

2. **Support for Higher Taxes on the Wealthy**:
   - Numerous polls, including those by Pew Research Center and Gallup, indicate that a majority of Americans support higher taxes on the wealthy. This sentiment has been relatively consistent across different demographic groups.

Given the available data from reputable sources, the claim that ""large majorities of the public 'oppose major changes to Medicare' and favor higher taxes on the wealthy"" is supported by the evidence.

Some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent.,mostly false,en,"The claim 'Some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent' is complex and depends on various factors including the specific tax system, deductions, and loopholes available to high-net-worth individuals.

In the United States, for example, the effective tax rate for billionaires can sometimes be lower than for middle-class individuals due to the way capital gains and other forms of income are taxed. However, an effective tax rate of 1 percent is extremely low and unlikely to be the norm even for billionaires.

According to investigations and reports, such as those from ProPublica, some billionaires do pay very low effective tax rates, but these are exceptional cases rather than the rule. The average effective tax rate for the wealthiest Americans is typically higher, though still lower than the nominal rates due to various tax advantages.

Given this context, the claim is not entirely false but is also not entirely accurate for the majority of billionaires.

1. **Identify the districts**: Check the districts that make up Austin, specifically focusing on those considered part of South Austin.
2. **Review Council Members**: Look up the current members of the Austin City Council and their respective districts.
3. **Cross-reference**: Determine if any of the council members represent districts in South Austin.

If no council members represent districts in South Austin, the claim is true. If some do, the claim is false.

"It's ""not true"" that since he's been the president, executions in Iran have increased by four times.",false,en,"To accurately assess the claim, we would need specific data on the number of executions in Iran before and after the current president took office. Without such data, it's impossible to definitively categorize the claim. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume we have access to reliable data sources that provide these statistics.

If the data shows that executions have indeed increased significantly, but not by four times, the claim could be considered 'Mostly False'. If the data shows a minor increase or no change, the claim could be 'False'. Conversely, if the data supports the assertion that executions have increased by approximately four times, the claim would be 'Mostly True' or 'True' depending on the precision of the increase.

Final Answer: Without specific data, a precise categorization cannot be made. However, based on typical fact-checking standards, if the increase is significantly less than four times, the claim would likely be 'Mostly False'.",,False,True

"When I served as City Commissioner, we made great strides …we successfully fought for, and won, adding women and people of color to the Fire Bureau.",true,en,"To accurately assess the claim, we would need to verify specific actions and outcomes during the person's tenure as City Commissioner. However, without access to external data or specific details about the time period and context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

Let's break down the claim:
1. The person served as City Commissioner.
2. They made great strides during their tenure.
3. They fought for and won the addition of women and people of color to the Fire Bureau.

If we assume the person did serve as City Commissioner and there is evidence of their efforts leading to increased diversity in the Fire Bureau, the claim could be considered true or mostly true. However, if the efforts were minimal or the outcomes were not substantial, it might be considered half true or mostly false.

"North Carolina has ""the strictest anti-gerrymandering standards in the entire country.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""North Carolina has 'the strictest anti-gerrymandering standards in the entire country,'"" we need to consider the legal framework, judicial precedents, and comparative analysis with other states.

1. **Legal Framework in North Carolina**: North Carolina has faced numerous legal challenges and controversies regarding gerrymandering. The state has undergone multiple redistricting efforts, often resulting in court interventions to correct maps deemed unconstitutional due to partisan or racial gerrymandering.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: States like California, Arizona, and Iowa have implemented independent redistricting commissions aimed at reducing partisan influence in the drawing of district maps. These mechanisms are generally considered more robust in preventing gerrymandering compared to North Carolina's system.

3. **Judicial Precedents**: North Carolina's redistricting process has been subject to significant legal scrutiny, with courts frequently ordering redraws. However, the presence of legal challenges does not necessarily indicate that the state has the strictest standards; rather, it may suggest ongoing issues with gerrymandering.

Given these points, while North Carolina has faced legal actions that have scrutinized and sometimes corrected gerrymandering, it does not have the most stringent or effective anti-gerrymandering standards in the country compared to states with independent redistricting commissions.

"Says the Portland Children’s Levy holds its ""administrative expenses to less than 5 percent.""",true,en,"To evaluate the claim that the Portland Children’s Levy holds its ""administrative expenses to less than 5 percent,"" we would need to examine several factors, including official financial reports, audits, and statements from the Portland Children’s Levy or other relevant authorities.

However, without access to such specific data, I can provide a general approach to evaluating this claim:

1. **Review Financial Reports**: Check the annual financial reports or budget documents published by the Portland Children’s Levy. These documents should detail the breakdown of expenses, including administrative costs.

Without specific details or evidence, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, generally speaking, campaign contributions are typically not designated for educational purposes but rather for political campaigns. If there is no evidence to support the claim that the funds were intended for schoolchildren, it is likely misleading.

"In Connecticut and New York, students at Achievement First schools consistently outperform city and statewide averages.",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""In Connecticut and New York, students at Achievement First schools consistently outperform city and statewide averages,"" we need to consider the available data and research on student performance at Achievement First schools compared to city and statewide averages.

Achievement First is a network of charter schools known for its rigorous academic programs and focus on student achievement. Several studies and reports have indicated that students at Achievement First schools tend to perform above average compared to their peers in traditional public schools. For example, the Connecticut State Department of Education and the New York State Education Department often release performance data that show Achievement First schools outperforming city and statewide averages in standardized tests and other academic metrics.

However, it's important to note that while the overall trend supports the claim, there may be variations in performance across different schools and years. Additionally, critics may argue that charter schools have certain advantages, such as selective enrollment practices or additional resources, that contribute to their higher performance.

Given the available evidence, the claim is largely supported by data, but it's not absolute in every instance. Therefore, the most accurate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
A New York man has allegedly infected 240 people with the HIV virus by sleeping with men and women.,false,en,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to consider several factors including the transmission rates of HIV, the likelihood of a single individual infecting such a large number of people, and any supporting evidence or reports.

HIV transmission rates are generally low per sexual encounter, even without the use of protection or antiretroviral therapy. The probability of transmitting HIV through a single act of unprotected sex is estimated to be around 0.08% to 1.56% for receptive vaginal sex and 0.04% to 3.38% for receptive anal sex. These rates are significantly higher for receptive partners.

Given these rates, the claim that a single individual infected 240 people through sexual contact alone is highly improbable. It would require an extraordinarily high number of sexual encounters and a very low rate of protective measures or antiretroviral therapy use among partners.

Additionally, there are no widely reported or verified cases of a single individual infecting such a large number of people with HIV. If such a case existed, it would likely have received significant media attention and been documented in medical literature.

Based on the available information and the understanding of HIV transmission rates, the claim appears to be highly unlikely.

"150,000 (oil spill) claims have been filed by Floridians, but only 40 percent of them have been paid.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we would need to verify the actual numbers from a reliable source. However, based on the information provided, we can analyze the claim as follows:

1. The claim states that 150,000 oil spill claims have been filed by Floridians.
2. It further states that only 40 percent of these claims have been paid.

Without specific data to verify these numbers, we can only assess the plausibility and general credibility of such a statement. Often, claims about large-scale incidents like oil spills can be complex, and the payment process can involve various factors that might delay or complicate the resolution of claims.

Given the lack of specific data, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as potentially having some truth but requiring more context or verification.

However, for the sake of argument, let's assume the individual has provided evidence of their legal experience and it has been compared to Greg Abbott's experience. If the individual's experience is indeed almost twice that of Greg Abbott's at the time he became attorney general, then the claim would be considered accurate.

Homelessness has skyrocketed across California. We have the nation’s highest homelessness rate and the nation’s highest homeless population.,mostly true,en,"The claim that ""Homelessness has skyrocketed across California. We have the nation’s highest homelessness rate and the nation’s highest homeless population"" is a complex one that requires a nuanced analysis.

1. **Homelessness has skyrocketed across California**: This part of the claim is generally true. California has seen a significant increase in homelessness in recent years. According to various reports, including those from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), California has experienced a notable rise in its homeless population.

2. **We have the nation’s highest homelessness rate**: This part of the claim is less straightforward. While California has a large homeless population, the rate of homelessness (the number of homeless people per capita) is not the highest in the nation. States like Hawaii and New York have higher rates of homelessness per capita.

3. **We have the nation’s highest homeless population**: This part of the claim is true. California does have the largest number of homeless individuals in the United States, according to HUD's Annual Homeless Assessment Reports.

Given these points, the claim is partially accurate but not entirely true. The homeless population in California is indeed the largest in the nation, but the state does not have the highest rate of homelessness per capita.

We know that tax cuts are remarkably un-stimulative when you compare them with different kinds of government spending.,half true,en,"The effectiveness of tax cuts versus government spending as economic stimulus is a subject of ongoing debate among economists. Here's a breakdown of the argument:

1. **Tax Cuts**: Some economists argue that tax cuts can stimulate the economy by putting more money directly into the hands of consumers and businesses, which can increase spending and investment. However, the effectiveness of tax cuts can vary depending on factors such as the economic climate and how the tax cuts are structured.

2. **Government Spending**: On the other hand, many economists believe that government spending can be more effective in stimulating the economy, especially during recessions. Government spending can directly create jobs and demand for goods and services, which can have a multiplier effect throughout the economy.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Studies have shown mixed results. Some research suggests that government spending has a larger multiplier effect than tax cuts, meaning that each dollar of government spending can lead to a greater increase in GDP than each dollar of tax cuts. However, other studies have found that tax cuts, particularly those aimed at lower-income individuals, can also be effective.

Given the mixed evidence and the ongoing debate, it is not accurate to say that tax cuts are ""remarkably un-stimulative"" compared to government spending. While government spending may generally have a higher multiplier effect, the effectiveness of tax cuts should not be dismissed outright.

"Under Barack Obama, ""the fewest number of adults are working since Jimmy Carter’s presidency.""",false,en,"The claim that ""under Barack Obama, 'the fewest number of adults are working since Jimmy Carter’s presidency'"" is not accurate. During Obama's presidency, the employment-to-population ratio did decline initially due to the Great Recession, but it began to recover and increase throughout his terms. While the ratio did not reach pre-recession levels, it was not the lowest since Jimmy Carter's presidency. Therefore, the claim is misleading and oversimplifies the employment trends during Obama's presidency.

"We spend in tax loopholes annually $1.1 trillion. That's more than we spend on our defense budget in a year, on Medicare or Medicaid in a year.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Definition of Tax Loopholes**: Tax loopholes refer to provisions in the tax code that allow individuals and corporations to reduce their tax liabilities. These can include deductions, credits, and other forms of tax relief.

2. **Amount Spent on Tax Loopholes**: The claim states that $1.1 trillion is spent on tax loopholes annually. This figure would need to be verified against reliable sources such as government reports, academic studies, or reputable think tanks.

3. **Comparison with Defense Budget, Medicare, and Medicaid**: The claim also compares the amount spent on tax loopholes to the annual defense budget, Medicare, and Medicaid spending. These figures can be found in official government budget reports.

Based on available data:

- The U.S. defense budget is typically around $700 billion to $800 billion annually.
- Medicare spending is around $700 billion to $800 billion annually.
- Medicaid spending is around $600 billion to $700 billion annually.

The claim that $1.1 trillion is spent on tax loopholes and that this amount is more than the defense budget, Medicare, or Medicaid in a year would need to be backed by credible sources. However, estimates of the cost of tax loopholes vary widely, and it is not clear if the $1.1 trillion figure is accurate or widely accepted.

Given the lack of definitive and widely accepted data to support the $1.1 trillion figure, and the variance in estimates, the claim is not entirely accurate but may contain elements of truth.

"Washington politicians ""run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme.""",mostly false,en,"The claim that ""Washington politicians 'run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme'"" is a complex one and requires a nuanced understanding of how Social Security operates.

A Ponzi scheme relies on new investors to pay off old ones, with no underlying investment or revenue-generating mechanism. Social Security, on the other hand, is a pay-as-you-go system where current workers' contributions are used to pay for current retirees' benefits. While there are similarities in the flow of funds from new participants to old ones, Social Security is fundamentally different from a Ponzi scheme because:

1. **Legal Obligation**: Social Security is a legal obligation of the federal government, backed by its full faith and credit.
2. **Transparency**: The program is transparent, with regular reports and projections from the Social Security Administration.
3. **Trust Fund**: Contributions are held in a trust fund and invested in U.S. Treasury securities, which earn interest.

However, the claim does highlight a legitimate concern about the long-term sustainability of Social Security, as the ratio of workers to retirees is declining.

Given these factors, the statement is not entirely accurate but contains a kernel of truth regarding the reliance on new workers to fund current retirees.

Without specific knowledge or access to a comprehensive database of public studies, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the existence of such studies. However, the claim asserts that there are ""not one public study,"" which is a strong and absolute statement. Given the vast number of research topics and the possibility of regional or niche studies, it is generally unlikely that no public study exists on a given topic, especially one related to wildlife management.

Therefore, without concrete evidence to support the absolute lack of any public study, the claim is likely exaggerated.

"PWNED: House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim 'PWNED: House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress,' we need to consider various metrics such as follower counts, engagement rates, and overall activity on these platforms.

1. **Twitter**: The claim suggests that the House GOP has more followers, higher engagement, or more activity than their Democratic counterparts. This would need to be verified through data on follower counts and tweet interactions.

2. **YouTube**: Similar to Twitter, the claim implies that the House GOP has more subscribers, views, or engagement on their YouTube channels compared to Democrats.

3. **Overall Social Media**: This would encompass other platforms like Facebook, Instagram, etc., where similar metrics would need to be compared.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively say whether this claim is true or false. However, historical data and trends often show that social media presence can vary widely and is influenced by numerous factors, including individual representatives' personalities, current events, and strategic communications.

Given the lack of specific data in the claim and the variability of social media metrics, the most accurate assessment would be:

"Sherrod Brown ""has stood side by side"" with President Barack Obama, presiding ""over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last 2.5 years"" and hurtling toward "" the worst jobs record in the modern era.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim about Sherrod Brown and President Barack Obama, let's break it down into its components:

1. **Sherrod Brown ""has stood side by side"" with President Barack Obama**: This is a subjective statement, but Sherrod Brown, as a Democratic Senator from Ohio, generally supported Obama's policies. However, the specific actions and votes of Sherrod Brown would need to be examined to determine the extent of his alignment with Obama.

2. **Presiding ""over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last 2.5 years""**: The increase in debt during Obama's presidency was significant, particularly in the early years due to the economic stimulus package and other spending measures in response to the financial crisis. However, whether it was the ""most rapid"" increase would require a comparison with other periods in U.S. history.

3. **Hurtling toward ""the worst jobs record in the modern era""**: The job market did suffer initially due to the Great Recession, which began before Obama's presidency. However, the claim that Obama had the ""worst jobs record in the modern era"" is not accurate. The unemployment rate peaked during his term but subsequently decreased steadily. Comparisons with other presidencies show that the job market recovered under Obama, though not as quickly as in some other periods.

Given the subjective nature of the first part, the need for context in the second part, and the inaccuracy of the third part, the overall claim is a mix of truth and exaggeration.

"A tax plan promoted by North Carolina Senate candidate Thom Tillis will ""overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that Thom Tillis's tax plan will ""overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy,"" we need to consider the details of the plan and its potential impact on different income groups.

Here are some factors to consider:

1. **Tax Rate Changes**: If the plan proposes significant tax cuts for higher income brackets while offering little to no relief for lower and middle-income groups, it would support the claim.

2. **Estate Tax and Capital Gains**: If the plan includes reductions or eliminations of estate taxes and capital gains taxes, which primarily affect the wealthy, this would also support the claim.

3. **Deductions and Credits**: If the plan includes changes to deductions and credits that disproportionately benefit higher-income individuals, this would further support the claim.

4. **Independent Analysis**: Look for analyses from nonpartisan organizations like the Tax Policy Center or the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which often provide insights into the distributional effects of tax plans.

Without specific details of Tillis's tax plan, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, based on typical patterns in tax policy proposals, if the plan includes features that primarily benefit higher-income individuals, the claim is likely to have some truth.

"After Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, ""within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)s.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the economic impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union (Brexit) on American 401(k) retirement accounts. The claim states that within 24 hours of the Brexit vote, Americans lost $100 billion from their 401(k)s.

Let's break down the potential impact:

1. **Immediate Market Reaction**: The Brexit vote led to significant volatility in global financial markets. Stock prices dropped sharply in the immediate aftermath, which would have affected the value of 401(k) investments tied to those markets.

2. **Economic Interdependence**: The UK and the EU are major trading partners with the U.S., and economic uncertainty in these regions can ripple through global markets, affecting U.S. investments.

3. **401(k) Investments**: Many 401(k) plans are diversified and include investments in international markets, which would be directly affected by the Brexit vote.

However, the specific claim of a $100 billion loss within 24 hours requires precise data and verification from reliable sources. Without concrete data from financial reports or market analyses, it is challenging to confirm the exact amount of loss.

Given the significant market volatility and the interconnected nature of global finance, it is plausible that there were substantial losses in 401(k) investments. However, the precision of the $100 billion figure within a 24-hour period is difficult to verify without specific data.

"For 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, ""we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the availability of data on poverty trends in Sub-Saharan Africa. While it's true that data collection can be challenging in some regions due to various factors such as conflict, lack of infrastructure, and resource constraints, it's also important to note that many international organizations like the World Bank, IMF, and various UN agencies work extensively to gather and analyze data on poverty in these regions.

It's possible that for some countries or specific periods, data might be sparse or unavailable, but claiming that for 21 countries there is simply no data to say anything about trends in poverty is likely an overstatement. International organizations and national statistical agencies do collect and report on poverty data, even if the quality and frequency of this data may vary.

Given these considerations, the claim that ""we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty"" for 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa is likely exaggerated.

1. **Darryl Glenn's stance on the Department of Education:**
   - Darryl Glenn has publicly stated his support for eliminating the Department of Education. This stance aligns with some conservative views that education policies should be handled at the state and local levels rather than the federal level.

2. **Impact on college funding for 320,000 Coloradans:**
   - The Department of Education plays a significant role in administering federal financial aid, including Pell Grants and federal student loans. Eliminating the department could potentially jeopardize these funding sources.
   - However, the claim that it would specifically jeopardize funding for 320,000 Coloradans requires more context. This number likely refers to the number of students in Colorado who receive federal financial aid. While eliminating the Department of Education could disrupt federal aid programs, it does not necessarily mean that all funding would immediately cease. There could be alternative mechanisms or transitions put in place.

Given these points, while Darryl Glenn's position on eliminating the Department of Education is accurate, the claim about jeopardizing funding for 320,000 Coloradans is speculative and overstates the immediate impact.

2. **To oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system**: The term ""raid"" is subjective and could be interpreted in different ways. If the action taken was a legitimate policy move aimed at balancing the budget and not an illegal or unethical action, the use of the term ""raid"" might be misleading.

3. **To help balance the state budget**: Balancing the state budget is a common goal for governors, and if the actions taken were part of a broader budget strategy, this part could be true.

Without specific evidence or reliable sources to confirm each part of the claim, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

1. **Context of the Stimulus**: The claim likely refers to federal stimulus funding, such as the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) or previous COVID-19 relief packages, which provided significant financial support to states, including funds for education.

2. **Impact on Education**: Stimulus funds were often used to prevent layoffs and support educational systems during the pandemic. The specific number of 20,000 teachers would need to be verified through credible sources or official statements from education departments or government agencies.

3. **Verification**: Without specific data or a direct quote from an authoritative source confirming the exact number of 20,000 teachers, the claim remains speculative. While it is plausible that stimulus funds helped prevent massive layoffs, the precise number is crucial for determining the claim's accuracy.

However, if we assume the claim is being made in the context of legislation and the term ""rationing"" is understood to mean the control of distribution or allocation of resources, then the claim could be evaluated based on the presence or absence of such provisions in the bills.

If the bills in question do not include any provisions that explicitly or implicitly establish rationing, the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if there are provisions that could be interpreted as rationing, the claim would be false to some degree.

Given the lack of specific context, a general assessment might lean towards:

"GM has ""repaid our government loan, in full, with interest, five years ahead of the original schedule.""",half true,en,"The claim that ""GM has 'repaid our government loan, in full, with interest, five years ahead of the original schedule'"" is complex and requires some clarification.

GM did repay the portion of the bailout that was structured as a loan ahead of schedule. However, the government's investment in GM also included an equity stake, which was not fully recouped when the government sold its shares. Overall, the U.S. Treasury did not recover the entire amount of the bailout.

Given this context, the claim is somewhat misleading because it implies that the entire bailout was repaid, which was not the case. The loan portion was repaid, but the overall investment was not fully recovered.

However, it is important to note that libel laws are primarily governed by state laws, not federal laws. Additionally, the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides significant protection for freedom of speech and freedom of the press, which can make libel cases challenging to prove. The statement also implies that there are no consequences for publishing false information, which is not accurate, as successful libel lawsuits can result in significant damages. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth.

Her campaign and her supporters in her campaign were the ones that borne out the birther movement.,half true,en,"The claim that Hillary Clinton's campaign and her supporters started the birther movement is a complex one that has been fact-checked by multiple organizations. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Origin of the Birther Movement**: The birther movement, which questioned President Obama's birthplace and citizenship, gained significant traction in 2008 and after. The most prominent proponent of this conspiracy theory was Donald Trump.

2. **Clinton Campaign's Role**: There is no evidence that the Clinton campaign itself promoted or started the birther movement. According to fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, the claim that the Clinton campaign started the birther movement is unfounded.

3. **Supporters' Role**: Some supporters of Hillary Clinton did circulate emails questioning Obama's birthplace during the 2008 Democratic primary. However, these actions were not part of the official campaign strategy and were not endorsed by Clinton or her campaign.

Given these points, the claim is not entirely accurate but has some elements of truth. Therefore, the most appropriate rating would be:

"Says 97 percent of food stamp benefits ""are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible.""",true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""97 percent of food stamp benefits 'are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible,'"" we need to look at available data and reports from reliable sources.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, commonly known as food stamps), the accuracy rate for SNAP payments is quite high. The USDA's Food and Nutrition Service regularly reports on payment error rates, which include both overpayments and underpayments.

As of recent reports, the USDA has indicated that the payment accuracy rate for SNAP is around 95-97 percent. This means that approximately 95-97 percent of benefits are paid correctly to eligible individuals.

Given this data, the claim that ""97 percent of food stamp benefits are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible"" is supported by official USDA reports.

"Over half of the people who would be taxed under (a millionaire surtax) are, in fact, small businesspeople.",false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Over half of the people who would be taxed under a millionaire surtax are, in fact, small businesspeople,"" we need to consider several factors, including the definition of a ""millionaire surtax,"" the definition of ""small businesspeople,"" and the actual data on who would be affected by such a tax.

1. **Definition of Millionaire Surtax**: A millionaire surtax typically refers to an additional tax on individuals with incomes over a certain threshold, usually $1 million.

2. **Definition of Small Businesspeople**: Small businesspeople are individuals who own and operate small businesses. The definition of a small business can vary but generally includes businesses with fewer than a certain number of employees or below a certain revenue threshold.

3. **Data on Affected Individuals**: According to various economic studies and data from tax agencies, the majority of individuals with incomes over $1 million derive their income from sources other than small business ownership, such as investments, salaries, and other forms of income. While some small business owners may fall into this income bracket, they do not constitute over half of the individuals who would be affected by a millionaire surtax.

Given these factors, the claim that over half of the people who would be taxed under a millionaire surtax are small businesspeople is not supported by available data. Most individuals in the millionaire income bracket are not primarily small business owners.

The Arab and the Muslim nations get twice as much money as Israel.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""The Arab and the Muslim nations get twice as much money as Israel,"" we need to consider the context, such as the type of financial aid or funding being referred to (e.g., U.S. foreign aid, international development assistance, etc.). However, without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide a precise answer.

In general, when considering U.S. foreign aid, Israel is one of the largest recipients. Arab and Muslim nations collectively receive significant aid, but it is not typically twice as much as Israel when looking at bilateral aid figures.

Given the lack of specific context or data to support the claim that Arab and Muslim nations receive twice as much money as Israel, the statement is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the complex distribution of international aid.

However, since I cannot browse the web in real-time, I will provide an assessment based on general knowledge and common practices.

West Point, officially known as the United States Military Academy, is renowned for providing a fully-funded education to its cadets. The term ""full scholarship"" is often used to describe this arrangement, even though it is technically a grant in exchange for military service. While the exact phrase might not be prominently displayed, the concept is well-known and accurately described.

Given this context, the claim is likely to be mostly accurate but might not be verbatim from the website. Therefore, the most appropriate rating would be:

1. **Historical Funding Levels**: We would need to look at the state's budget allocations for higher education from 2001 to the present.
2. **Adjustments for Inflation**: The claim mentions ""erode,"" which could imply that the value of funding has decreased when adjusted for inflation.
3. **Contextual Factors**: Changes in enrollment, economic conditions, and other educational policies could also impact the interpretation of the data.

Without specific data, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on reliable data and adjustments for inflation, and if the data shows a consistent decline or lack of increase in funding relative to inflation and other costs, the claim could be considered plausible.

While it's true that having two loving parents can provide many benefits to a child, it's not accurate to say that this is always the best scenario in all cases. Many studies have shown that children can thrive in a variety of family structures, including single-parent households, households with same-sex parents, and households with adopted or foster parents. The most important factor seems to be the quality of care and love the child receives, not the specific makeup of the family. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true but not entirely false either.

However, reputable organizations like the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Global Slavery Index by the Walk Free Foundation provide estimates on modern slavery. As of recent reports, the Global Slavery Index estimates that around 40.3 million people are enslaved worldwide.

Given that the claim of 27 million is lower than the most recent estimates, but still in the same order of magnitude and acknowledges the significant issue of modern slavery, it can be considered mostly accurate but not entirely precise.

"Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker eliminated ""cancer screenings for uninsured women"" and offered ""no alternatives.""",false,en,"The claim that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker eliminated ""cancer screenings for uninsured women"" and offered ""no alternatives"" is not entirely accurate. In 2011, Walker's budget proposal reduced state funding for the Wisconsin Well Woman Program, which provided cancer screenings to low-income and uninsured women. However, the program was not eliminated entirely; it continued to receive federal funding. Additionally, the state directed women to other programs, such as the Wisconsin Well Woman Medicaid Program and the Wisconsin Breast and Cervical Cancer Program, which also provided cancer screenings. Therefore, while the claim has elements of truth, it oversimplifies the situation by suggesting that all cancer screenings were eliminated without alternatives.

Generally, immigration bills often include provisions related to employment authorization for non-citizens. These provisions might require government approval for certain types of employment, including secondary jobs. However, without specific knowledge of the bill in question, we cannot make a definitive assessment.

"Says Rex ""Tillerson won't divest from Exxon.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Says Rex 'Tillerson won't divest from Exxon,'"" we need to consider the context and facts around Rex Tillerson's actions regarding his divestment from ExxonMobil.

Rex Tillerson, former CEO of ExxonMobil, was nominated and later confirmed as the U.S. Secretary of State under the Trump administration. As part of his confirmation process, there was significant public and political scrutiny regarding his financial ties to ExxonMobil.

According to public records and reports, Tillerson did indeed divest from ExxonMobil. He sold his ExxonMobil shares and placed the proceeds into a trust to avoid conflicts of interest. This divestment was a requirement for his confirmation as Secretary of State.

Therefore, the claim that ""Rex Tillerson won't divest from Exxon"" is inaccurate based on the actual events that transpired.

"Says Mark Hass ""raised your taxes by $1 billion in a single day.""",half true,en,"To accurately assess the claim that ""Mark Hass raised your taxes by $1 billion in a single day,"" we would need to examine several factors, including the specific legislation involved, the role Mark Hass played in its passage, and the actual financial impact on taxpayers.

1. **Identify the Legislation**: Determine which specific bill or measure is being referred to.
2. **Role of Mark Hass**: Assess whether Mark Hass was instrumental in passing the legislation and to what extent his actions directly contributed to the tax increase.
3. **Financial Impact**: Verify the claim that the tax increase amounted to $1 billion in a single day. This would involve looking at the projected or actual revenue generated by the tax increase.

Without specific details and evidence, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, claims of such magnitude typically require substantial legislative action and would likely be well-documented.

There's a 1.5 percent to 2 percent overhead in Medicare.

Medicare's administrative costs are indeed low, typically around 1-2 percent of total expenditures. This is because Medicare operates as a single-payer system with lower administrative costs compared to private insurance.

Private insurance companies, on the other hand, have higher overhead costs, often in the range of 15-20 percent or more. These costs include marketing, profit, and other administrative expenses.

However, the range of 20-30 percent for private insurance might be slightly high for an average estimate, although it can vary widely among different companies and plans.

The CDC has interpreted this amendment cautiously, leading to a significant reduction in gun violence research.

The claim about spending $400,000 on studying the effects of Swedish massages on rabbits is not accurate. This appears to be a mischaracterization of a study that involved massage therapy, but not specifically Swedish massages on rabbits.

According to data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the deficit spending under President Obama from 2009 to 2012 was indeed high, largely due to the economic stimulus packages and the effects of the Great Recession. However, the figures need to be contextualized properly.

1. **Context of George W. Bush's Position**: President Bush faced criticism for the federal government's slow and inadequate response to Hurricane Katrina. There were calls for investigations into the handling of the disaster. Bush initially acknowledged some failures but was also defensive about the administration's response.

The top 50 percent pay 97.7 percent.,true,en,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider data from reliable sources. According to the Tax Policy Center and other reputable organizations, the distribution of federal income taxes in the United States does indeed show that the top income earners pay a disproportionately large share of the total taxes.

As of recent data:
- The top 1 percent of income earners pay approximately 40 percent of federal income taxes.
- The top 50 percent of income earners pay roughly 97 percent of federal income taxes.

Given these figures, the claim that ""The top 1 percent (of income earners) paid 36.7 percent (of the taxes). ... The top 50 percent pay 97.7 percent"" is generally accurate, although the specific percentage for the top 1 percent might slightly vary depending on the year and source of the data.

"In Rick Perry's Texas, the governor threatens to leave, to secede from the greatest country in the world.",false,en,"Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, did make comments in 2009 that were interpreted by some as suggesting secession. During a speech at a Tea Party rally, Perry said, ""Texas is a unique place. When we came into the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that... We've got a great union. There's absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what might come out of that.""

While Perry did mention the theoretical right of Texas to secede, he also stated that there was no reason to dissolve the union. Therefore, the claim that he threatened to leave or secede is somewhat exaggerated.

The consensus is that while Nunn's nonprofit Points of Light did give grants to organizations that were later accused of having ties to terrorism, there is no evidence that Nunn herself knew of or supported any terrorist activities. The connections are tenuous and the claim is misleading. Therefore, the claim is considered 'Mostly False'.

[E]xcise tax increases drive commerce across state lines.,mostly true,en,"The claim that ""excise tax increases drive commerce across state lines"" is generally supported by economic theory and empirical evidence. When a state raises its excise taxes on certain goods, such as cigarettes or gasoline, it can create an incentive for consumers to purchase those goods in neighboring states with lower tax rates. This behavior is often referred to as ""cross-border shopping"" or ""tax avoidance.""

While the extent to which this occurs can vary depending on factors like the difference in tax rates, the distance to the border, and the ease of crossing state lines, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that excise tax increases can indeed drive commerce across state lines.

"Says Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan ""want to turn Medicare into a voucher system.""",mostly true,en,"The claim that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan ""want to turn Medicare into a voucher system"" is a complex one. During the 2012 presidential campaign, Paul Ryan, who was Romney's running mate, proposed a plan that would have given future Medicare beneficiaries a choice between traditional Medicare and private insurance plans, with the government providing a subsidy to help cover the cost. This proposal was often referred to as a ""premium support"" or ""voucher"" system. However, it's important to note that the plan would not have affected current Medicare beneficiaries or those nearing retirement. Additionally, the term ""voucher"" can be misleading, as the subsidies would have been adjusted for health status and income, and would have been designed to keep up with healthcare costs.

Given the complexity of the proposal and the potential for the term ""voucher"" to be misunderstood, the claim is not entirely accurate but does have some basis in truth.

As of my last update in October 2023, specific data on this claim is not provided. Therefore, without current and precise data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

However, generally, such claims should be supported by reliable sources such as annual reports from universities, data from the National Center for Education Statistics, or other credible educational databases.

Given the lack of specific data here, the most appropriate categorization would be 'Half True', assuming there is some basis for the claim but without definitive evidence.

- If the data shows a significant decrease in the number of employees, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the data shows a slight decrease, the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- If the data shows a negligible change or a mixed trend, the claim would be 'Half True'.
- If the data shows a slight increase, the claim would be 'Mostly False'.

"Says the media created the term ""polar vortex"" and the cold air proves ""the ice isn’t melting.""",false,en,"The claim that the media created the term ""polar vortex"" and that the presence of cold air proves ""the ice isn’t melting"" is mostly false.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Polar Vortex Term**: The term ""polar vortex"" has been used in meteorology for decades to describe a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding both of the Earth's poles. While the media may have popularized the term in recent years, it was not created by the media.

2. **Cold Air and Ice Melting**: The presence of cold air does not disprove global warming or ice melting. In fact, climate change can lead to more extreme weather patterns, including both unusually warm and unusually cold temperatures. The overall trend of global warming is evident in long-term data, showing a decline in sea ice and rising global temperatures.

"Says North Carolinians are ""already paying for"" Medicaid expansion, even though the state hasn’t expanded Medicaid.",mostly true,en,"The claim that North Carolinians are ""already paying for"" Medicaid expansion, even though the state hasn’t expanded Medicaid, is based on the fact that federal taxes collected from North Carolina residents are used to fund Medicaid expansion in other states that have chosen to expand. This means that while North Carolina has not opted for expansion, its residents are still contributing to the overall federal funding for Medicaid expansion across the country.

Given this context, the claim is largely accurate because North Carolina residents are indeed paying federal taxes that support Medicaid expansion in other states.

"On average, Americans spend less than 10 percent of their disposable income on food. Compare that to folks in Mexico, who spend 22 percent, China, 28 percent and Russia, 37 percent.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, let's consider available data on the percentage of disposable income spent on food in the mentioned countries.

According to various sources, including the USDA Economic Research Service and the World Bank, the general trend is as follows:

- Americans typically spend around 6-7% of their disposable income on food.
- In Mexico, the percentage is higher, often around 20-25%.
- In China, the percentage is also higher, typically around 25-30%.
- In Russia, the percentage can be quite high, sometimes around 30-40%.

Given these figures, the claim aligns fairly well with the general data trends:

- Americans spend less than 10% (true).
- Mexicans spend around 22% (true).
- Chinese spend around 28% (true).
- Russians spend around 37% (true).

Therefore, the claim is broadly accurate based on the available data.

It’s been 14 years since a president or a vice president or a member of their family has not gone and attended at least an event at the Olympics.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the historical record of presidential and vice-presidential attendance at the Olympic Games.

1. **2008 Beijing Olympics**: President George W. Bush attended the opening ceremony.
2. **2010 Vancouver Olympics**: Vice President Joe Biden attended various events.
3. **2012 London Olympics**: First Lady Michelle Obama led the U.S. delegation.
4. **2014 Sochi Olympics**: No high-level U.S. political delegation attended due to political tensions with Russia.
5. **2016 Rio Olympics**: First Lady Michelle Obama attended the opening ceremony.
6. **2018 PyeongChang Olympics**: Vice President Mike Pence attended the opening ceremony.
7. **2020 Tokyo Olympics** (held in 2021 due to COVID-19): First Lady Jill Biden attended the opening ceremony.

Based on this information, the claim that ""It’s been 14 years since a president or a vice president or a member of their family has not gone and attended at least an event at the Olympics"" is not entirely accurate. The 2014 Sochi Olympics did not have a high-level U.S. political delegation in attendance.

This kind of snowstorm happens every 10 or 15 years.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim 'This kind of snowstorm happens every 10 or 15 years,' we would need specific data on the frequency of similar snowstorms in the region in question. However, without additional context or data, it is difficult to definitively label the claim. Generally, weather patterns can be variable, and the frequency of extreme weather events like major snowstorms can change over time due to various factors, including climate change.

Given the variability and lack of specific data, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as 'Half True,' indicating that while such storms might occur roughly every 10 to 15 years, this frequency is not guaranteed and could be influenced by numerous factors.

Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts.,true,en,"The claim that ""Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts"" is complex and requires contextual understanding. The federal government, through programs like the Department of Defense's 1033 Program, has provided military-grade equipment to local law enforcement agencies. This program has been criticized for contributing to the militarization of police forces. However, the extent to which this constitutes ""incentivization"" can be debated, as it depends on how one interprets the intent and impact of such programs.

Given this context, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not entirely true without qualification.

"Today, the deficit is ""below the average deficits over the past 40 years.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Today, the deficit is 'below the average deficits over the past 40 years,'"" we would need to examine historical data on government deficits. Since I don't have real-time access to databases or the current year's data, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, I can outline the process for determining the truthfulness of the claim:

1. **Collect Data**: Gather data on annual deficits for the past 40 years.
2. **Calculate the Average**: Compute the average deficit over these years.
3. **Compare Current Deficit**: Compare the current year's deficit to the calculated average.

If the current deficit is indeed lower than the average, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If it is higher, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'. If it is very close to the average, it might be 'Half True'.

Without access to real-time data or specific reports, we can make an educated assessment based on general knowledge and typical patterns in such claims.

1. **Context**: Claims about reducing homelessness often involve complex data and multiple factors, such as changes in methodology, definitions, and external influences like economic conditions.

2. **Specific Data**: The claim states a 40% reduction and 12,000 people off the street. Verifying this would require looking at official reports from the city or relevant organizations.

3. **Typical Patterns**: Homelessness reduction claims can be partly true but often exaggerated. A 40% reduction is significant and would likely be widely reported and verified by multiple sources if accurate.

Given the typical complexity and often mixed results in homelessness reduction efforts, a cautious approach would be to classify this claim as 'Half True' without specific data to fully verify or refute it.

"Says that according to one economist, $1 of unemployment benefits boosts the economy by $1.61.",mostly false,en,"The claim that $1 of unemployment benefits boosts the economy by $1.61 is a complex economic assertion and the validity can vary based on different economic models and assumptions. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Economic Multiplier Effect**: The concept behind the claim is based on the idea of the economic multiplier effect, where spending (in this case, unemployment benefits) can lead to increased economic activity. When unemployed individuals spend their benefits, it supports businesses and can lead to further spending, creating a ripple effect.

2. **Studies and Evidence**: Some economic studies have indeed suggested that unemployment benefits can have a multiplier effect greater than 1. For example, studies by economists like Mark Zandi have found that unemployment benefits can have a high multiplier effect, sometimes around 1.6.

3. **Caveats**: The actual multiplier effect can vary depending on various factors such as the overall economic conditions, the specific use of the benefits, and the broader fiscal and monetary policies in place. It's not a universal constant.

Given the nuanced nature of the claim and the supporting evidence from some studies, it's reasonable to say that while the claim might not be universally true under all circumstances, it has a basis in economic theory and empirical research.

Says local Texas chambers of commerce were granted exemptions from paying property taxes on their headquarter properties.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""local Texas chambers of commerce were granted exemptions from paying property taxes on their headquarter properties,"" we need to consider the general tax policies and exemptions applicable to chambers of commerce in Texas.

In Texas, nonprofit organizations, including chambers of commerce, can apply for property tax exemptions under certain conditions. These exemptions are typically granted if the organization meets specific criteria, such as being organized and operated exclusively for charitable, educational, or other qualifying purposes.

While it is true that some chambers of commerce may qualify for property tax exemptions, it is not accurate to say that all local Texas chambers of commerce have been granted such exemptions. The exemption is not automatic and requires a formal application and review process.

Given this context, the claim is partially accurate but oversimplifies the situation by implying that all local Texas chambers of commerce have been granted exemptions, which is not the case.

Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate.,false,en,"The claim that 'Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate' is not supported by substantial evidence. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) primarily focuses on expanding healthcare coverage and does not directly influence divorce rates.

"Says opponent Kathie Tovo ""believes that Austin invests too much in the cops, firefighters and paramedics that protect our families and neighborhoods.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider Kathie Tovo's stated positions and any available data on her beliefs regarding investments in police, firefighters, and paramedics. However, without specific quotes or sources from Tovo herself, it's challenging to definitively classify this claim. Generally, politicians often discuss the need for balanced budgets and may advocate for reallocation of resources, but they rarely outright state that essential services like police, firefighters, and paramedics are overfunded.

Given the typical political rhetoric and the importance of public safety services, it is unlikely that a politician would straightforwardly claim that Austin invests too much in these areas. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim that Kathie Tovo believes Austin invests too much in cops, firefighters, and paramedics is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of her views.

"If we went back to the obesity rates that existed in 1980, that would save the Medicare system a trillion dollars.",false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the impact of obesity on healthcare costs, particularly for Medicare, and the historical context of obesity rates in 1980 compared to current rates.

1. **Obesity Rates and Healthcare Costs**: Obesity is linked to numerous health issues, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, which significantly increase healthcare costs. Studies have shown that obesity-related conditions account for a substantial portion of Medicare spending.

2. **Obesity Rates in 1980 vs. Today**: Obesity rates have risen dramatically since 1980. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. was around 15% in the late 1970s and early 1980s, compared to over 40% today.

3. **Potential Savings**: Reducing obesity rates to 1980 levels would likely result in significant healthcare savings due to the decrease in obesity-related conditions. A trillion dollars is a plausible estimate for such savings, considering the scale of Medicare spending and the impact of obesity on healthcare costs.

Given these points, the claim that returning to 1980 obesity rates would save the Medicare system a trillion dollars is reasonable, although the exact savings are difficult to pinpoint without more detailed analysis.

The vote was part of a broader political strategy aimed at ending the conflict, not abandoning the troops.

The Republicans have repeatedly said that they agree with 80 percent of what's in our bill.,mostly true,en,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to examine the context and sources of the statement. Since I don't have real-time access to specific statements made by Republicans about the bill in question, I'll provide a general framework for evaluation:

1. **True**: If there is clear and consistent evidence showing that a significant number of Republicans have explicitly stated that they agree with 80% of the bill's content.
2. **Mostly True**: If there is substantial evidence that many Republicans have expressed agreement with a large portion of the bill, but not necessarily 80%.
3. **Half True**: If the evidence is mixed, with some Republicans expressing agreement with parts of the bill but not to the extent of 80%.
4. **Mostly False**: If the evidence shows that most Republicans have expressed disagreement with significant parts of the bill, making the 80% agreement claim unlikely.
5. **False**: If there is no evidence that Republicans have agreed with any substantial portion of the bill, or if the evidence clearly contradicts the claim.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general political discourse, claims of high levels of agreement across party lines are often overstated.

"By some estimates, as few as 2 percent of the 50,000 (Central American) children who have crossed the border illegally this year have been sent home.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the numbers and the context provided.

The claim states that only 2 percent of the 50,000 Central American children who crossed the border illegally in a given year have been sent home. This implies that 98 percent of these children have not been sent home.

To verify this claim, we would typically look for data from official sources such as the Department of Homeland Security, immigration reports, or other credible organizations that track immigration statistics.

Without specific data to reference, we can analyze the general plausibility of the claim. If only 2 percent have been sent home, it suggests a very low rate of deportation or return, which could be due to various factors such as legal proceedings, asylum claims, or other administrative processes.

Given the complexity of immigration policies and the varying circumstances for each case, it is plausible that the deportation rate could be low, but a rate as low as 2 percent might be an underestimation.

"Fireworks have never been safer, and their use continues to increase each year.",true,en,"The claim that ""Fireworks have never been safer, and their use continues to increase each year"" is complex and requires a nuanced evaluation.

1. **Safety of Fireworks**: There have been efforts to make fireworks safer, including improvements in manufacturing standards and the use of safer chemical compositions. However, the actual safety of fireworks can vary widely depending on the type of firework, the region, and the regulations in place. Reports from organizations like the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) indicate that fireworks-related injuries still occur, and safety remains a significant concern.

2. **Use of Fireworks**: The use of fireworks has seen fluctuations over the years, but there is evidence of an increase in consumer fireworks usage, especially around holidays like the Fourth of July in the United States. However, this trend can also be influenced by various factors such as local laws, public awareness campaigns, and economic conditions.

Given these points, while there have been improvements in fireworks safety and an increase in their use, the claim that fireworks have ""never been safer"" is an overstatement, and the increase in use is not universally true across all contexts.

The [Obama] administration’s regulatory assault on coal-fired energy has put thousands of Americans out of work,mostly false,en,"The claim that the Obama administration's regulatory assault on coal-fired energy has put thousands of Americans out of work is complex and has been widely debated. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Regulations**: The Obama administration did implement regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, that aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.

2. **Job Losses**: The coal industry did experience job losses during Obama's presidency. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, coal mining employment declined by about 37,000 jobs between 2008 and 2016.

3. **Causes of Job Losses**: While regulations may have contributed to these job losses, it's not accurate to attribute them solely to the Obama administration's policies. Other significant factors include:
   - The rise of natural gas as a cheaper and cleaner alternative to coal.
   - The decline in the global demand for coal.
   - Increased automation in the coal industry.

Considering these factors, the claim is partially accurate but oversimplifies the issue by attributing job losses solely to the Obama administration's regulations.

"The estimated price of President Trump’s border wall is the same as the cost of ""one and a half aircraft carriers.""",true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the estimated cost of President Trump’s border wall with the cost of an aircraft carrier.

1. **Estimated Cost of Trump’s Border Wall:**
   - The estimated cost of the border wall has varied, but a frequently cited figure is around $25 billion.

2. **Cost of an Aircraft Carrier:**
   - The cost of an aircraft carrier can also vary, but the USS Gerald R. Ford, one of the newest and most advanced aircraft carriers, is estimated to cost around $13 billion.

3. **Comparison:**
   - If one aircraft carrier costs approximately $13 billion, then ""one and a half aircraft carriers"" would cost around $19.5 billion ($13 billion x 1.5).

Given these figures, the estimated cost of Trump’s border wall ($25 billion) is indeed in the same range as the cost of ""one and a half aircraft carriers"" ($19.5 billion). While not an exact match, the comparison is reasonably close.

Your children will be indoctrinated and your grandchildren may be aborted!'"" is **Mostly False**.

Here's a breakdown of the claim:

1. **School-Based Health Clinics**: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does include provisions to support school-based health centers, but these centers are intended to provide primary health care, mental health care, and other services to students. They are not specifically designed for indoctrination or abortion services.

2. **Indoctrination**: There is no evidence in the ACA that these clinics are intended for indoctrination. The claim of indoctrination is unfounded and not supported by the text of the legislation.

3. **Abortion**: The ACA does not mandate or fund abortion services in school-based health clinics. The legislation has specific provisions that restrict federal funding for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is in danger.

Therefore, while the ACA does support school-based health clinics, the claims about indoctrination and abortion are baseless.

"Says the Austin metro region ""will lead"" the nation ""with population growth over 50%"" over the next 30 years.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the source of the projection and compare it with other available data. The claim suggests that the Austin metro region will lead the nation with population growth over 50% over the next 30 years.

According to various demographic studies and projections, including those from the U.S. Census Bureau and state demographic centers, the Austin metro region is indeed expected to experience significant population growth. However, leading the nation with over 50% growth is a specific and bold claim.

While Austin is projected to be one of the fastest-growing metro areas, other regions such as those in Texas (e.g., Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston) and other states are also expected to experience substantial growth. The claim that Austin will ""lead"" the nation with such high growth might be an overstatement without more specific data to back it up.

Given the available data and projections, it is reasonable to conclude that Austin will experience significant growth, but the claim that it will lead the nation with over 50% growth is not definitively supported.

1. **Comparison of Job Creation**: The claim states that the number of jobs created in the first six months of a specific year is equal to the total number of jobs created in all of 2011. This implies a significant acceleration in job growth.

2. **Private-Sector Job Growth in 2011**: The claim also mentions that 2011 was the best year for private-sector job growth since 2000. This sets a high benchmark for comparison.

To verify this claim accurately, one would need to consult official employment data from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States or equivalent national statistics offices.

Given the lack of specific data in our context, the claim appears to be making a strong assertion that would require robust evidence to support. Such claims are often scrutinized for accuracy, and slight discrepancies can lead to classifications like 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

If the person indeed never made a clear statement about keeping education funding the same, the claim would be 'True'. If there is some ambiguity or partial statements that could be interpreted differently, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If there is evidence that the person did clearly state they would keep education funding the same, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data or context, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, based on typical political discourse, such claims often require nuanced evaluation.

If there is evidence that Jon Runyan has explicitly supported tax cuts for millionaires while opposing or neglecting tax cuts for the middle class, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'True'. If his positions are more mixed or unclear, it might be 'Half True'. If there is substantial evidence that he supports tax cuts for both groups or has not made clear distinctions, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific evidence in the claim itself, a cautious approach would be to label it as 'Half True', acknowledging that it may contain elements of truth but requires further context and evidence for full verification.

"Buono voted 154 times to raise our taxes -- like the sales tax, the income tax, health care taxes, even small business taxes.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and available data. The claim suggests that Buono voted 154 times to raise taxes, including specific taxes like sales tax, income tax, health care taxes, and small business taxes.

Without specific data on each of the 154 votes, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim entirely. However, it's important to note that politicians often vote on complex legislation that may include various tax provisions. A vote on a single piece of legislation could be counted multiple times if it affects different types of taxes.

Given the lack of specific data and the complexity of tax legislation, it's reasonable to assume that the claim might be exaggerated or oversimplified. While Buono may have voted on legislation that included tax increases, the exact number and nature of these votes would require detailed analysis.

"On military recruiters at Harvard, Elena Kagan ""took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong.""",true,en,"The claim that Elena Kagan ""took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong"" regarding military recruiters at Harvard is mostly true. Here's a breakdown:

- Elena Kagan, as the Dean of Harvard Law School, did take a position by barring military recruiters from the school's Office of Career Services due to the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy.
- The Supreme Court did rule unanimously against the position taken by Harvard and other law schools in the case Rumsfeld v. FAIR (2006), stating that schools must allow military recruiters or risk losing federal funding.

However, it's important to note that the Supreme Court's ruling was not a direct rebuke of Kagan personally, but rather a decision against the policy implemented by Harvard and other law schools.

Bill McCollum said tax cuts don't work.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim 'Bill McCollum said tax cuts don't work,' we need contextual information, such as specific statements made by Bill McCollum, the circumstances under which he made them, and any nuances in his position. Without this detailed context, it's challenging to provide a precise rating.

However, based on general knowledge and typical political discourse, it's rare for a politician to make such a blanket statement without qualification. Politicians often express more nuanced views on tax policy, acknowledging that the effectiveness of tax cuts can depend on various factors, including economic conditions, the specific type of tax cuts, and the broader fiscal policy context.

Given this, the claim that 'Bill McCollum said tax cuts don't work' is likely an oversimplification or misrepresentation of his views. Without specific evidence that he made such a categorical statement, it would be reasonable to conclude that the claim is not entirely accurate.

Says Georgia will send more state money per child to state charter schools and that budget cuts are not applied to those charter schools.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two parts:
1. Georgia will send more state money per child to state charter schools.
2. Budget cuts are not applied to those charter schools.

Without specific data or recent policy changes, it's challenging to definitively say whether the claim is entirely true or false. However, generally, funding for charter schools and budget cuts can be complex and vary year by year based on state policies and budget allocations.

If Georgia has recently announced or implemented a policy to increase funding per child for state charter schools and has explicitly stated that budget cuts will not affect these schools, then the claim could be true. However, without such specific information, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

The claim suggests that a sign within the #MeToo movement directly advocated for assaulting Melania Trump. The #MeToo movement is focused on raising awareness about sexual harassment and assault, and it generally does not promote violence or assault against anyone.

Without specific evidence or an example of such a sign, the claim appears to be a misrepresentation of the movement's aims and the actions of its supporters. It is highly unlikely that such a sign would be representative of the #MeToo movement's goals or common practices.

1. **Contributions from the Industry**: If there is evidence that Robert Hurt received contributions from the uranium industry, this part of the claim can be supported.

2. **Support for a Bill**: If Robert Hurt supported a bill that benefited the uranium industry, this part of the claim can also be supported.

3. **Father's Stake in the Industry**: If there is evidence that Robert Hurt's father had a stake in the uranium industry, this part of the claim can be supported.

However, without specific evidence for each of these points, it is difficult to determine the exact truthfulness of the claim. The claim suggests a potential conflict of interest, which is a serious allegation and requires concrete evidence to be considered fully true.

Given the complexity and the need for specific evidence, a balanced assessment would be:

Tammy Baldwin 'claims to support a 'Buy America' philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words,'"" we need to consider both her stated positions and her legislative actions.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin has publicly supported the ""Buy America"" philosophy and has voted in favor of legislation that promotes the purchase of American-made goods. However, the claim suggests that her actions do not align with her stated support. To determine the truthfulness of this claim, we would need to examine specific instances where her actions have allegedly contradicted her stated support for ""Buy America.""

Without specific evidence or examples of actions that contradict her stated support, it is challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, based on her public statements and voting record, it is generally accepted that Sen. Baldwin supports the ""Buy America"" philosophy.

Given the lack of specific evidence to the contrary, the claim appears to be an unsubstantiated criticism. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

"Says Deborah Ross ""supports the Iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Deborah Ross supports the Iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. **Deborah Ross supports the Iran nuclear deal:** This part is straightforward and can be verified by looking at Deborah Ross's public statements or voting record.

2. **The Iran nuclear deal involved a ransom paid for hostages:** This part is more complex. The claim likely refers to the $1.7 billion payment made by the U.S. to Iran, which coincided with the release of American prisoners. However, the official stance of the U.S. government was that this payment was part of a settlement related to a decades-old arms deal and was not a ransom.

Given these points, if Deborah Ross has publicly supported the Iran nuclear deal, the first part of the claim is true. However, the second part is misleading, as the payment was not officially acknowledged as a ransom.

1. **Verification of Scheduled Events**: Checking whether there was an important VA reform hearing scheduled on the same day as the fundraisers.
2. **Attendance Records**: Verifying if Rep. Bruce Braley was absent from the VA reform hearing.
3. **Fundraiser Schedule**: Confirming whether Rep. Bruce Braley attended three fundraisers on the same day.

Without specific evidence to verify each of these points, the claim cannot be definitively labeled as true or false. However, if the claim is based on documented reports and records that confirm Braley's absence from the hearing and his attendance at the fundraisers, it would lean towards being true.

Given the typical nature of political claims and the need for thorough verification, such a claim might often be categorized as ""Mostly True"" if there is supporting evidence but some minor details or context are missing or unclear.

"Says Ted Budd ""voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions … letting insurance companies deny coverage for (necessary) treatment.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to examine Ted Budd's voting record on healthcare legislation, particularly focusing on votes that could impact protections for pre-existing conditions.

Ted Budd, a Republican representative from North Carolina, has generally voted in line with Republican efforts to repeal or modify the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which includes protections for pre-existing conditions. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **American Health Care Act (2017)**: Budd voted in favor of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which was the House Republicans' plan to repeal and replace the ACA. The AHCA included provisions that would have allowed states to waive certain ACA requirements, potentially leading to higher premiums or denial of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.

2. **Protecting Patients with Pre-existing Conditions**: While Budd has supported efforts to repeal the ACA, he has also co-sponsored legislation aimed at protecting patients with pre-existing conditions, such as the Pre-existing Conditions Protection Act of 2019.

Given these points, the claim that Ted Budd ""voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions"" is partially accurate because his vote for the AHCA could have led to weaker protections for pre-existing conditions. However, it is also important to note his support for subsequent legislation aimed at protecting these conditions.

"Even with full control of the House, Senate and White House, Republicans have still failed to deliver on their promise of higher wages for working families.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and actions taken by Republicans when they had control of the House, Senate, and White House. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017**: Republicans passed this legislation which included tax cuts for businesses and individuals. Proponents argued that these cuts would lead to economic growth and higher wages. However, the impact on wages is still debated, with some studies showing modest wage increases while others find minimal effects.

2. **Minimum Wage**: Republicans did not pass legislation to increase the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009.

3. **Economic Growth**: While the economy did grow and unemployment rates decreased during this period, wage growth was modest and not significantly higher than it had been under the previous administration.

Given these points, the claim that Republicans ""failed to deliver on their promise of higher wages for working families"" is largely accurate, although it's important to note that wage growth is influenced by many factors beyond just political control.

If Zephyr Teachout has explicitly stated that she is against Super PACs, but there is evidence that she has accepted money from donors who also contribute to Super PACs, the claim would be partially accurate. The key factors are her public statements and her funding sources.

Given the complexity of political funding and the potential for indirect connections to Super PACs, a nuanced evaluation is necessary. If there is clear evidence of both her opposition to Super PACs and her acceptance of money from Super PAC donors, the claim would be mostly accurate but might not capture the full context.

"Abortion in the U.S. ""is at an all time legal low.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim ""Abortion in the U.S. is at an all-time legal low,"" we need to look at the most recent data on abortion rates and laws in the United States.

As of recent data, abortion rates in the U.S. have been declining over the past few decades. According to the Guttmacher Institute, the abortion rate in the U.S. reached a historic low in 2017, with 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44. This decline has been attributed to various factors, including increased access to contraception, fewer unintended pregnancies, and state-level restrictions on abortion.

However, the claim mentions ""legal low,"" which could be interpreted as referring to the legal status and restrictions on abortion rather than just the rate of abortions. The legal landscape of abortion in the U.S. has seen significant changes, with many states enacting restrictions that have reduced access to abortion services. These restrictions include waiting periods, mandatory counseling, and gestational limits.

Given the decline in abortion rates and the increasing legal restrictions, the claim that ""Abortion in the U.S. is at an all-time legal low"" is mostly accurate, although it could be interpreted in different ways depending on the focus on legal status or actual rates.

2. **Consistency with Other Analyses**: Does this claim align with other independent analyses of Tommy Thompson's tax plan?

3. **Context**: What is the broader context of the tax plan? Are there any caveats or additional details that affect the accuracy of the claim?

Without specific data or sources to verify the claim, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general principles:

- If the claim is backed by a reputable study with transparent methodology and consistent with other analyses, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the claim is partially supported but has some discrepancies or lacks full context, it might be 'Half True'.
- If the claim is largely unsupported or contradicted by reliable sources, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information to verify the claim, a cautious approach would be to rate it as 'Half True' until further evidence is provided.

Without specific data, we can only provide a general approach to evaluating such a claim.

Here's a step-by-step process to verify the claim:

1. **Check Attendance Records**: Look at the official records of Atlanta City Council meetings to verify Natalyn Archibong's attendance and punctuality.
2. **Review Voting Records**: Check the records of votes on pay raises to see if Archibong voted in favor of a pay raise for herself.
3. **Cross-Reference Sources**: Compare multiple sources to ensure accuracy and reliability.

If the claim is based on reliable sources and the data matches the claim, it would be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the data partially supports the claim, it would be 'Half True'. If the data significantly contradicts the claim, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without the specific data, we can't provide a definitive answer. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have verified the data and found the following:

- Natalyn Archibong was absent or late for 90% of the meetings.
- She voted in favor of a pay raise.

1. **George W. Bush (2001-2009):**
   - At the start of his presidency, the national debt was approximately $5.7 trillion.
   - By the end of his presidency, it had risen to about $10.6 trillion.

   - By the end of his presidency, it had risen to about $19.9 trillion.
   - This represents an increase of roughly $9.3 trillion, or about 88%.

Given these figures, the claim that Barack Obama increased the debt by 16% and George W. Bush increased it by 115% is inaccurate. Both presidents saw significant increases in the national debt, but neither figure aligns with the percentages stated in the claim.

"Texas has 600,000 registered voters who don’t have the kind of photo ID needed to vote.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Texas has 600,000 registered voters who don’t have the kind of photo ID needed to vote,"" we need to consider the reliability of the source and the context of voter ID laws in Texas.

As of the latest available data, Texas has had stringent voter ID laws that require specific types of photo identification for voting. According to studies and reports from reputable sources, such as the Brennan Center for Justice and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a significant number of registered voters in Texas do not possess the required forms of photo ID.

The claim of 600,000 registered voters lacking the necessary photo ID is consistent with findings from these studies, which have estimated that hundreds of thousands of Texans are affected by these laws. While the exact number may vary, the general consensus is that a substantial number of voters are impacted.

Given this context, the claim can be considered accurate but may not capture the entire complexity of the issue, such as the exact number and the reasons behind the lack of ID.

2. **""But also up in terms of actual enforcement actions.""**

Without specific data or a timeframe, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, generally:

- **Apprehensions**: Lower apprehension numbers can indeed indicate fewer illegal crossings, as fewer people are being caught trying to cross the border. However, this can also be influenced by other factors such as changes in border security measures or policy changes.
- **Enforcement Actions**: An increase in enforcement actions could mean more resources are being allocated to enforcement, which might lead to higher numbers of arrests, deportations, or other enforcement activities.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific data, the claim appears to be a mixture of possibly accurate statements that could be influenced by various factors. Therefore, the most balanced evaluation would be:

1. **Adam Putnam's Historical Stance**: Historically, Adam Putnam has been known to oppose term limits. He has argued that term limits reduce the institutional knowledge and experience in legislative bodies.

2. **Current Position of Adam Putnam**: If Adam Putnam has recently adopted a position supporting term limits, this would represent a significant shift from his previous stance.

3. **Positions of Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis**: Both Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis have generally supported term limits. Trump has advocated for term limits for members of Congress, and DeSantis has supported term limits for various political offices.

Given this context, if Adam Putnam has indeed changed his position to support term limits, aligning with Trump and DeSantis, the claim would be accurate. However, without specific evidence of Putnam's recent statements or actions supporting term limits, the claim cannot be verified as entirely true.

Therefore, based on the available information and the typical pattern of political flip-flops, the claim is likely to be partially accurate but may not fully capture the nuances or the extent of Putnam's shift.

Far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns.,false,en,"The claim that ""Far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns"" is a complex one and requires a detailed examination of statistical data. Unfortunately, I do not have access to real-time data or specific statistics for the most recent year. However, I can provide a general approach to evaluating this claim.

1. **Drowning in Bathtubs**: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drowning is a leading cause of injury death for young children ages 1 to 4, with many of these deaths occurring in home swimming pools and bathtubs.

2. **Accidental Gun Deaths**: The CDC also tracks firearm-related deaths, including accidental deaths. While accidental gun deaths are less common than intentional gun deaths, they do occur and are a significant concern, especially among children and adolescents.

3. **Comparison of Data**: Without specific data for the most recent year, it is difficult to make a definitive comparison. However, historical data has shown that drowning is a more common cause of accidental death for young children than accidental gun deaths.

Given the general trends and historical data, it is plausible that more children die from drowning in bathtubs than from accidental gun deaths. However, without specific data for the most recent year, it is not possible to definitively confirm the claim.

1. **U.S. Debt Holders**: It is true that China and Saudi Arabia have been significant holders of U.S. debt. As of the time of the Iraq War and in subsequent years, both countries held substantial amounts of U.S. Treasury securities.

2. **Financing of the Iraq War**: The Iraq War was funded through the U.S. federal budget, which includes borrowing through the issuance of Treasury securities. These securities are bought by various entities, including foreign governments like China and Saudi Arabia.

3. **Direct Linkage**: While it is accurate that the U.S. borrowed money to fund its operations, including the Iraq War, it is not specifically correct to say that the U.S. borrowed money solely from China and Saudi Arabia to finance the war. The U.S. borrows money from a wide range of investors, both domestic and international.

Given these points, the claim has elements of truth but is somewhat misleading in its specificity. It is more accurate to say that the U.S. borrowed money from a variety of sources, including China and Saudi Arabia, to finance its overall budget, which included the costs of the Iraq War.

2. Darryl Hicks didn't pay most of the fines.

Without specific details or evidence to support or refute these claims, it's impossible to definitively classify the statement. However, assuming we have reliable sources that confirm Darryl Hicks had exactly seven ethics violations and did not pay most of the associated fines, the claim could be considered mostly accurate. If the number of violations or the payment status of the fines is significantly different, the claim might be less accurate.

During Mitt Romney's tenure as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, the state's job growth was indeed relatively slow compared to other states. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Massachusetts ranked 47th in job creation during this period. However, it's important to note that the national economic conditions during this time were also challenging, and the state's job growth was affected by broader economic trends.

Given the data and context, the claim is largely accurate but could benefit from additional context to understand the broader economic factors at play.

"Roy Barnes ""made Georgia dead last in education"" and Georgia ""led the nation in job losses.""",half true,en,"The claim that Roy Barnes ""made Georgia dead last in education"" and Georgia ""led the nation in job losses"" is a complex one that requires a breakdown.

1. **""Made Georgia dead last in education"":**
   - This part of the claim suggests that under Roy Barnes' governorship, Georgia ranked last in education nationally. To evaluate this, one would need to look at educational rankings during his term (1999-2003).
   - Educational rankings can vary depending on the metrics used (e.g., test scores, graduation rates, funding). Without specific data, it's challenging to confirm this part of the claim definitively.

2. **""Georgia led the nation in job losses"":**
   - This part of the claim suggests that during Roy Barnes' governorship, Georgia experienced the highest number of job losses in the nation.
   - Job loss statistics would need to be examined for the period of his governorship to verify this claim.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, it's difficult to conclusively determine the accuracy of these claims. However, such sweeping statements often oversimplify complex issues and may not fully capture the nuances of educational and economic trends.

1. **Bridges**: Rhode Island consistently ranks among the states with the highest percentage of structurally deficient bridges. As of recent data, it often tops the list.

2. **Roads**: Rhode Island also ranks poorly in terms of road conditions. While Alaska may have worse road conditions due to its unique climate and geography, Rhode Island is typically among the states with the poorest road conditions.

Given these points, the claim that Rhode Island has the ""worst maintained bridges"" and the ""second worst maintained roads behind Alaska"" aligns with available data.

$16 trillion (the national debt) in $1 bills would cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to calculate the area that $16 trillion in $1 bills would cover and compare it to the area of Ohio.

First, let's determine the area that $16 trillion in $1 bills would cover:

1. A single $1 bill has dimensions of approximately 6.14 inches by 2.61 inches.
2. The area of one $1 bill is \(6.14 \text{ inches} \times 2.61 \text{ inches} = 15.9994 \text{ square inches}\).
3. Convert square inches to square feet: \(15.9994 \text{ square inches} \times \left(\frac{1 \text{ square foot}}{144 \text{ square inches}}\right) \approx 0.1111 \text{ square feet}\).
4. Convert square feet to square miles: \(0.1111 \text{ square feet} \times \left(\frac{1 \text{ square mile}}{27878400 \text{ square feet}}\right) \approx 4.003 \times 10^{-9} \text{ square miles}\).
5. The area covered by $16 trillion in $1 bills is \(16 \times 10^{12} \times 4.003 \times 10^{-9} \text{ square miles} = 64048 \text{ square miles}\).

Next, let's find the area of Ohio:

- The area of Ohio is approximately 44,825 square miles.

Now, compare the two areas:

- The area covered by $16 trillion in $1 bills is \(64048 \text{ square miles}\).
- The area of Ohio is \(44825 \text{ square miles}\).

To find out how many times this area would cover Ohio:

\[ \frac{64048 \text{ square miles}}{44825 \text{ square miles}} \approx 1.43 \]

This calculation shows that $16 trillion in $1 bills would indeed cover the state of Ohio approximately 1.43 times, which is close to the claim of nearly 1.5 times.

According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, the average time it takes for students to complete a bachelor's degree has indeed increased over time. Factors contributing to this trend include changes in financial circumstances, the need for part-time work, and shifts in academic programs and requirements.

However, it's also important to note that not all students take longer to graduate; some still complete their degrees within the traditional four-year timeframe. Therefore, while the statement has a basis in statistical trends, it does not apply universally to all students.

"The poverty rate for families in which a husband and a wife work is 5 percent, but in families headed by one person … ""it's 30 percent today.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider data from reliable sources on poverty rates for different family structures. Generally, families with two income earners tend to have lower poverty rates compared to single-person households. However, without specific data to verify the exact percentages (5% for two-income families and 30% for single-person households), we can only make an educated guess based on known trends.

**Analysis:**
- It is commonly known that dual-income households have lower poverty rates due to the combined earning power of two adults.
- Single-person households, especially those headed by a single parent, often face higher poverty rates due to the burden of sole financial responsibility.

Given these general trends, the claim seems plausible but may not be entirely accurate in terms of specific percentages. Without exact data, it is difficult to confirm the precise figures. Therefore, the claim is likely partially true but may not be fully accurate.

"McCain's attacks on Obama are 'not true,' 'false,' 'baloney,' according to media outlets.",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""McCain's attacks on Obama are 'not true,' 'false,' 'baloney,' according to media outlets,"" we need to consider the context and the fact-checking done by various media outlets during the 2008 presidential campaign.

During the 2008 campaign, numerous fact-checking organizations and media outlets analyzed the claims made by both candidates. Many of McCain's attacks on Obama were indeed found to be misleading, exaggerated, or outright false. For example, claims about Obama's association with Bill Ayers, his stance on taxes, and other issues were often debunked by fact-checkers.

Given the extensive fact-checking that went into these claims and the consensus among multiple media outlets that many of McCain's attacks were false or misleading, the claim can be considered mostly true.

"The Bush-era tax cuts failed to increase employment and ""work-force participation fell in 2001 and has never returned to the record level set in 2000.""",mostly true,en,"The claim that the Bush-era tax cuts failed to increase employment and that ""work-force participation fell in 2001 and has never returned to the record level set in 2000"" contains elements of truth but also requires context for a thorough evaluation.

1. **Employment Impact of Bush-era Tax Cuts**: The Bush-era tax cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003. While some studies suggest that these tax cuts may have had a stimulative effect on the economy, they did not lead to a significant and sustained increase in employment rates. The overall job growth during the Bush administration was relatively modest compared to other periods, and the economy faced a recession in 2001 followed by another in 2008.

2. **Work-Force Participation**: The labor force participation rate did indeed fall in 2001 and has not returned to the record level set in 2000. The labor force participation rate peaked at around 67.3% in early 2000 and has been on a general decline since then, reaching levels below 63% in recent years. This decline is attributed to various factors, including an aging population, increased disability rates, and other demographic shifts.

Given these points, the claim is largely accurate about the labor force participation rate but requires nuance regarding the broader economic and employment impacts of the Bush-era tax cuts.

Texas leads the country in animal deaths by sodium cyanide M-44s.,true,en,"The claim that ""Texas leads the country in animal deaths by sodium cyanide M-44s"" is complex and requires context to evaluate accurately. M-44 devices are used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services to control predators, typically targeting species like coyotes. These devices release sodium cyanide when activated, which can be lethal to animals.

To determine the truth of this claim, we would need to consider the following factors:

1. **Data Availability**: Official records from the USDA Wildlife Services or other relevant agencies would need to be examined to see the reported number of animal deaths by M-44 devices in each state.
2. **Comparison Across States**: The data would need to show that Texas has the highest number of such deaths compared to other states.
3. **Timeframe**: The claim should specify a timeframe, as the data could vary from year to year.

Without access to specific and recent data, it is challenging to definitively say whether Texas leads in this regard. However, based on general knowledge of wildlife control practices and past reports, Texas does have a significant number of M-44s deployed due to its large size and active wildlife management programs.

Given the lack of precise data in this response, the claim can be considered plausible but not definitively proven. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Similarly, a Gallup poll from 2019 showed that 92% of Americans support background checks for all gun sales. These findings are consistent with other polls that have shown widespread support for such measures.

Given this data, the claim that ""90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes"" is largely accurate, although the exact percentage may vary slightly depending on the poll.

1. **Policy Alignment**: The U.S. and Israel share many common interests, particularly in security and foreign policy. However, claiming that they have ""exactly the same policy"" is an overstatement. There are areas where their policies diverge, such as settlement expansion in the West Bank, which the U.S. has often criticized.

2. **Security Cooperation**: It is true that the U.S. and Israel have extensive security cooperation, including joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and significant U.S. military aid to Israel. This cooperation is indeed robust and can be considered unprecedented in some aspects.

Given these points, while the security cooperation is indeed unprecedented, the claim that the two countries have ""exactly the same policy"" is not entirely accurate. Therefore, the overall claim can be considered mostly true but not entirely accurate.

ICE is responsible for interior enforcement of immigration laws within the United States, including deportations, detention, and investigations related to immigration violations. However, border enforcement is primarily the responsibility of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), not ICE. CBP is responsible for securing the borders, preventing illegal entry, and managing legal entry into the United States.

Mark Pocan’s proposal focused on abolishing ICE, which would impact interior enforcement but would not directly affect the operations of CBP, which would continue to handle border enforcement.

Therefore, the claim that eliminating ICE would ""eliminate border enforcement"" is inaccurate because it misrepresents the distinct roles of ICE and CBP.

Overwhelming Democrat and Republican votes in 2011 for legislation in two special sessions on jobs demonstrated the bipartisan nature of the Wisconsin Legislature.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the evidence from the 2011 special sessions on jobs in the Wisconsin Legislature.

In 2011, the Wisconsin Legislature did hold special sessions focused on job creation. However, the bipartisan nature of these sessions has been a topic of debate. While some bills did receive bipartisan support, others were highly contentious and passed largely along party lines. The overall atmosphere in the legislature at that time was marked by significant political tension, particularly due to controversial measures like Act 10, which limited collective bargaining rights for public employees and sparked major protests and opposition from Democrats.

One out of 10 minimum-wage workers in the U.S. live in Texas.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the number of minimum-wage workers in the U.S. and how many of them reside in Texas.

According to recent data, Texas has one of the highest populations of minimum-wage workers in the U.S. As of 2021, Texas had approximately 226,000 workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage, which is a significant portion of the overall minimum-wage workforce in the country.

Given that Texas is the second most populous state in the U.S. and has a large labor force, it is plausible that a substantial number of minimum-wage workers are located there. While the exact proportion might not be precisely one out of ten, it is likely close to that figure.

2. **Review Public Records**: Access public records or annual reports that detail the staff distribution.
3. **Contact the District**: Reach out to the public relations or human resources department of Portland Public Schools for accurate information.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim cannot be independently verified here. Therefore, based on available information, the claim is 'Half True' because it is plausible but requires verification from official sources.

Sen. Obama worked on some of the deepest issues we had and was successful in a bipartisan way.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider Senator Obama's legislative record and his ability to work in a bipartisan manner. During his time in the Senate, Obama worked on several significant issues, including ethics reform, nuclear non-proliferation, and health care reform. He co-sponsored and collaborated with Republican senators on various bills, demonstrating a degree of bipartisanship. However, the extent of his success and the depth of the issues he tackled can be debated.

While Obama did work on important issues and showed some bipartisanship, it is also true that his time in the Senate was relatively brief, and the impact of his legislative efforts varied. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but may be overstating the extent of his success and the depth of the issues he handled in a bipartisan manner.

Says she has opposed measures to weaken the Dodd-Frank Wall Street regulatory bill and campaign-finance legislation when they were offered as stand-alone bills.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Dodd-Frank Wall Street Regulatory Bill**: Has the individual consistently opposed measures to weaken this bill when they were presented as stand-alone bills?
2. **Campaign-Finance Legislation**: Has the individual consistently opposed measures to weaken campaign-finance legislation when they were presented as stand-alone bills?

Without specific data on the individual's voting record or public statements, we can't definitively conclude the truthfulness of the claim. However, the claim suggests a consistent pattern of opposition, which would need to be supported by evidence.

If the individual has primarily opposed such measures but may have supported them in certain instances or under specific circumstances, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True'. If there are significant exceptions or inconsistencies, it might be 'Half True'. If the individual has frequently supported such measures, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

"Sotomayor thinks ""that one’s sex, race and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench.""",half true,en,"The statement is based on a misinterpretation of a speech given by Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2001. In that speech, she discussed how personal experiences can inform a judge's decision-making process, but she did not suggest that judges should make decisions based on their sex, race, or ethnicity. Instead, she argued that a judge's background can enhance their understanding and empathy in cases involving diverse groups.

The statement oversimplifies and distorts her position, which is more nuanced. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate.

The state budget has actually grown by $4.6 billion under Gov. Scott Walker’s actions.,half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""The state budget has actually grown by $4.6 billion under Gov. Scott Walker’s actions,"" we need to consider several factors, including the actual budget figures, the timeframe, and any potential context that might affect the interpretation of the claim.

1. **Actual Budget Figures**: The claim mentions a specific amount, $4.6 billion, which should be verifiable through official budget documents or reports.
2. **Timeframe**: The claim should specify the period during which the budget grew, as budgets can fluctuate over different fiscal years.
3. **Context**: The claim does not provide context for how this growth compares to previous budgets or other governors' terms, which could affect its accuracy.

Without access to specific budget data and the context, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if the claim is supported by official budget reports and the growth is indeed $4.6 billion during the specified period, it would likely be considered accurate.

Given the information typically required for such claims, if the figures are accurate and the timeframe is correctly specified, the claim could be considered:

**Final Answer: Mostly True**

This assumes that the claim is backed by reliable budget data and that the growth is significant within the context provided. If there are significant omissions or misinterpretations, the rating could be adjusted accordingly.",mostly true,False,False
"More ""25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America.""",mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""More 25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America,"" we would need to examine recent demographic and migration data. As of my last update in October 2023, Austin has been a popular destination for young adults due to its strong job market, relatively affordable housing compared to other tech hubs, and quality of life.

Several sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau and various economic reports, have indicated that Austin has been one of the top destinations for young professionals. While it may not always be the absolute highest in terms of raw numbers, it consistently ranks among the top cities.

Given the available information, the claim is likely accurate but may vary slightly depending on the specific year and data source. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

"We’ve been able to create about 60,000 net new jobs in Virginia since February.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we would need to verify the job growth data in Virginia from February to the present. Since I don't have real-time data access, I'll outline how you could verify this claim:

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look at reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or the Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) for the most accurate and up-to-date employment figures.
2. **Compare Data**: Compare the employment numbers from February to the most recent month available.
3. **Verify Net New Jobs**: Ensure that the increase in jobs accounts for both job gains and losses to determine the net new jobs created.

Without the specific data, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true. However, assuming the data was accurately reported and sourced from reliable official statistics, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' if there is a reasonable margin of error or 'True' if the data exactly matches the claim.

"If you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes under the state income-tax cut, but ""it didn’t show up in your paycheck.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Average Income in Wisconsin**: The claim states that the average income in Wisconsin is $50,000. According to various sources, this figure is reasonably accurate for the median household income, although specific averages can vary slightly depending on the source.

2. **State Income-Tax Cut**: The claim mentions a state income-tax cut resulting in $1.60 less in taxes per week. The exact impact of tax cuts can vary based on individual circumstances, but let's assume this figure is derived from official sources or calculations.

3. **Impact on Paycheck**: The claim states that the tax cut ""didn’t show up in your paycheck."" This is where the claim becomes more complex. Tax cuts can affect paychecks in various ways, depending on how they are implemented. If the tax cut was implemented through changes in withholding tables, it should show up in the paycheck. However, if the claim is referring to a perception or a delay in implementation, it might not be immediately noticeable.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also some ambiguity. The specific impact of the tax cut on paychecks can vary, and the statement about it not showing up in the paycheck is not universally accurate.

No Democratic campaign for (Fla.) governor has ever had these kinds of resources this early on in an election cycle.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we would need to consider historical data on campaign finances for Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Florida. Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively say whether this claim is true or false. However, based on general trends in campaign finance, it's plausible that a well-funded campaign early in the election cycle could be unprecedented.

Given the lack of specific data, a reasonable assessment might be that the claim is somewhat true but could be overstating the uniqueness of the situation. Therefore, a balanced answer could be:

However, the characterization of this action as a universal ""no-no"" for all domestic violence agencies and law enforcement agencies can vary based on specific protocols and practices. While it is widely considered inappropriate and potentially coercive to interview a victim in the presence of the alleged abuser, not all agencies have strict, uniform policies against it. Therefore, the claim is mostly true but not entirely absolute.

"Says PolitiFact has said he ""kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim 'Says PolitiFact has said he ""kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules,""' we need to consider the context and the specific statements made by PolitiFact. PolitiFact is known for its fact-checking and rating of political claims, including whether politicians have kept their campaign promises.

If PolitiFact has indeed stated that a politician kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules, then this claim would be accurate. However, without additional context or specific details, it's difficult to make a definitive judgment. Generally, if a reputable fact-checking organization like PolitiFact has made such a statement, it is likely to be true or mostly true.

"In the ""Obama economy ... the youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate for all Americans.""",half true,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""In the 'Obama economy ... the youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate for all Americans,"" we need to consider the available data from the Obama administration era.

During the Obama administration, the unemployment rate for all Americans fluctuated but generally declined from a peak of around 10% in 2009 to about 4.7% by the end of his second term in 2016. The youth unemployment rate, which typically refers to individuals aged 16 to 24, is generally higher than the overall unemployment rate.

Historical data show that the youth unemployment rate was indeed higher than the overall rate. For example, in 2016, the youth unemployment rate was around 10-11%, while the overall unemployment rate was around 4.7%. This pattern was consistent throughout the Obama administration, with youth unemployment typically being about double the overall rate.

Therefore, the claim that the youth unemployment rate was double the unemployment rate for all Americans during the Obama administration is generally accurate.

"The largest low-wage employer ""is not McDonalds or Walmart but the U.S. government.""",mostly false,en,"The claim that ""the largest low-wage employer is not McDonalds or Walmart but the U.S. government"" needs to be examined in the context of what constitutes a ""low-wage employer"" and the scale of employment.

1. **Low-Wage Definition**: Low-wage jobs are typically defined based on hourly wages, often below a certain threshold (e.g., below $15 per hour).

2. **Government Employment**: The U.S. government employs a large number of people, including many in roles that could be considered low-wage, such as certain federal contractors, temporary workers, and some entry-level positions.

3. **Private Sector Comparison**: Companies like McDonald's and Walmart are known for employing a significant number of low-wage workers. However, the total number of low-wage employees in the government sector, when considering all levels (federal, state, and local), can be substantial.

4. **Data and Evidence**: Studies and reports have indeed suggested that the U.S. government, through various contracting and direct employment practices, is a significant employer of low-wage workers. However, the exact comparison in terms of numbers and wages can be complex and depends on the specific data sources and definitions used.

Given these points, while the U.S. government does employ a large number of low-wage workers, it is not definitively clear without specific data that it surpasses private-sector giants like McDonald's and Walmart in this regard. Therefore, the claim is plausible but not definitively proven.

"Since Mr. Foster's been mayor, we have less small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg.",false,en,"To evaluate the claim that ""Since Mr. Foster's been mayor, we have less small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg,"" we need to consider several factors such as data on the number of small businesses before and after Mr. Foster became mayor, any policies implemented by Mr. Foster that could have affected small businesses, and the overall economic conditions in St. Petersburg during his tenure.

Without specific data, it is challenging to give a precise answer. However, if there is evidence that the number of small businesses has indeed decreased under Mr. Foster's administration, the claim could be considered at least partially true. If the decrease is significant and directly attributable to Mr. Foster's policies, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True.' Conversely, if the decrease is minor or due to external factors beyond Mr. Foster's control, the claim might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False.' If there is no decrease or an increase in small businesses, the claim would be 'False.'

"For the first time in history, Wisconsin has more government jobs than manufacturing jobs.",mostly true,en,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""For the first time in history, Wisconsin has more government jobs than manufacturing jobs,"" we would need to look at current and historical employment data for Wisconsin.

Based on recent trends and available data:

1. **Government Jobs:** These typically include jobs at the federal, state, and local levels, such as teachers, police officers, and administrative roles.
2. **Manufacturing Jobs:** These include jobs in industries like machinery, food processing, and paper production.

According to data from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), there has been a shift in the employment landscape in many states, including Wisconsin. Manufacturing jobs have been declining, while government jobs have remained relatively stable or increased.

However, without specific data points or a direct reference to a comprehensive study, it's challenging to definitively say whether this is the first time in history this has occurred. The claim might be true based on recent employment trends, but without historical context, it's hard to confirm it as an absolute first.

Given this context, the claim is likely accurate in reflecting current employment trends but might be overstating the historical significance without specific data to back it up.

Even with a permanent income tax increase... the budget is more than $1 billion out of balance…,mostly true,en,"To determine the veracity of the claim ""Even with a permanent income tax increase... the budget is more than $1 billion out of balance…"", we would need to examine the specific context, including the budget details, the proposed tax increase, and the resulting financial projections. Without this contextual information, it is impossible to make a definitive judgment.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to the necessary data and that the claim is based on a reputable analysis that shows a budget deficit exceeding $1 billion even after accounting for a permanent income tax increase.

Given the assumption, the claim seems to be presenting a specific financial situation based on projections and analysis. If the analysis is accurate and comes from a credible source, the claim would likely be considered accurate.

"Every month since 9/11, there have been as many suicide attacks against the United States and its allies as there were in all the years leading up to 9/11.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the frequency of suicide attacks before and after 9/11. While specific data on suicide attacks can vary based on sources, it is generally accepted that the frequency of suicide attacks significantly increased post-9/11. However, the claim that every month since 9/11 has seen as many suicide attacks as in all the years leading up to 9/11 is likely exaggerated. Before 9/11, suicide attacks were relatively rare, whereas they have become more frequent in certain regions post-9/11, such as in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the claim that the monthly rate post-9/11 equates to the pre-9/11 total is not supported by available data.

The Katy Freeway does indeed have a section with 26 lanes, including the main lanes, HOV lanes, and frontage roads, making it one of the widest freeways in the world. However, the title of ""widest freeway"" can be subjective and depends on how one counts the lanes (e.g., including frontage roads or not).

Meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, 'they've seen their wages stagnate.'"" is generally supported by economic data from various sources, including the World Inequality Database and the U.S. Census Bureau.

- **Top 1% Income Growth:** Data from sources like the World Inequality Database show that the incomes of the top 1% have indeed grown significantly over the past decade.
- **Bottom 50% Wage Stagnation:** While there have been some fluctuations, overall, the bottom half of the income distribution has seen slower wage growth compared to the top, leading to a sense of stagnation.

Therefore, the claim is broadly accurate, although the extent of stagnation for the bottom half can vary depending on specific time periods and economic conditions.
