Nigeria spends 7 times less in health care per capita than South Africa.,false,fr,"To evaluate the claim that ""Nigeria spends 7 times less in healthcare per capita than South Africa,"" we need to look at the most recent data available on healthcare expenditures per capita for both countries.

As of the latest available data:
- South Africa's healthcare expenditure per capita is around $500-$600 USD.
- Nigeria's healthcare expenditure per capita is around $80-$100 USD.

Let's calculate the ratio:
- If South Africa spends approximately $550 (mid-range estimate) per capita and Nigeria spends approximately $90 (mid-range estimate) per capita, the ratio is $550 / $90 ≈ 6.11.

This ratio is close to 7 times less, but not exactly 7 times. However, given the variability in estimates and the fact that the ratio is quite close, the claim can be considered mostly true.

The blocking quarter has been removed from the Senegalese constitution.Since 2006 has not existed.,true,fr,"The claim is about a specific change in the Senegalese constitution regarding the ""blocking quarter."" To evaluate this claim accurately, we need to understand what the ""blocking quarter"" refers to and whether there were any constitutional changes related to it in 2006.

The ""blocking quarter"" is a term that refers to a provision in some electoral systems where a party must secure at least a certain percentage of votes (often 25%) to be eligible for any seats in the legislature. This provision is designed to prevent very small parties from gaining representation.

In the context of Senegal, the constitution has undergone several revisions, but specific details about the ""blocking quarter"" provision and its removal in 2006 are not widely documented in readily accessible sources. Therefore, without specific evidence confirming the removal of the ""blocking quarter"" provision in 2006, it is challenging to verify the claim's accuracy.

Given the lack of clear and accessible information supporting the claim, it is prudent to consider it as not fully substantiated.

"«As long as we were in government, we had an unemployment than two points lower than the European average, today they have an unemployment of two points higher than the European average.Youth unemployment is even dramatic, 32%;It means that 3 out of 10 young people don't have a job """,mostly true,it,"To assess the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Unemployment rate during the period the speaker's party was in government.
2. Current unemployment rate compared to the European average.
3. Current youth unemployment rate.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure and typical patterns in such claims, here's a general assessment:

1. **Unemployment Rate Comparison**: The claim suggests a significant shift in the unemployment rate relative to the European average. If the data supports a two-point difference in both directions, this part could be considered mostly true.

2. **Youth Unemployment Rate**: The claim states that youth unemployment is at 32%, which is a specific and verifiable figure. If this figure matches official statistics, it can be considered true.

Given the lack of specific data to verify each point, the claim could be considered **Half True** if the general trends align but specific figures might not be entirely accurate.

The commercial surplus of Germany violates European rules?,true,it,"The claim that 'The commercial surplus of Germany violates European rules' is complex and requires contextual understanding. The European Union does have rules regarding macroeconomic imbalances, and Germany's large and persistent trade surplus has been a subject of debate. However, the European Commission has not formally ruled that Germany's surplus violates EU rules, although it has recommended that Germany take action to reduce imbalances. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but has some basis in ongoing economic discussions.

"""Argentina has unconventional gas resources that the second one in the world ranking after China""",true,es,"The statement ""Argentina has unconventional gas resources that the second one in the world ranking after China"" appears to be incomplete or incorrectly phrased. The intention seems to be to convey that Argentina has the second-largest unconventional gas resources in the world after China.

As of the most recent data, Argentina is indeed recognized for its significant unconventional gas resources, particularly in shale gas. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Argentina ranks second in the world for technically recoverable shale gas resources, following China.

Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate but could be better phrased for clarity.

"The ONE poverty group highlights 10 countries, including nine in Africa, where it is ""the most difficult"" for girls to have access to education.",half true,fr,"The claim that 'The ONE poverty group highlights 10 countries, including nine in Africa, where it is ""the most difficult"" for girls to have access to education' appears to be based on specific data or reports from the ONE Campaign. The ONE Campaign is a reputable organization that advocates for action against poverty and preventable diseases, particularly in Africa. Given the organization's focus and credibility, it is reasonable to assume that their reports are based on thorough research and data analysis.

However, without direct access to the specific report or data from the ONE Campaign, it is challenging to verify the claim with absolute certainty. Nonetheless, based on the organization's reputation and typical areas of focus, it is likely that their findings are credible.

"“In education we go from 25% of the total budget to 17%, 8 points.In health something similar happened, from 19% to 14% """,half true,es,"To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the accuracy of the percentage changes mentioned for both education and health budgets.

1. Education Budget Change:
   - Claimed change: From 25% to 17%
   - Actual change: 25% to 17% is a decrease of 8 percentage points.

2. Health Budget Change:
   - Claimed change: From 19% to 14%
   - Actual change: 19% to 14% is a decrease of 5 percentage points, not similar to the 8 points decrease as claimed.

The claim states that both education and health budgets decreased by similar amounts (8 points), but the health budget actually decreased by 5 points, not 8 points. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
[There was] fall in child mortality,mostly true,pt,"To accurately assess the claim ""There was a fall in child mortality,"" we need to consider global trends over recent decades. According to organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, there has been a significant decline in child mortality rates worldwide. This decline is attributed to various factors, including improvements in healthcare, vaccination programs, better nutrition, and advancements in medical technology.

"""[Italy is the] first country regarding the number of blue helmets, the eighth contributor to the world as regards the budget [of peace missions]""",mostly true,it,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two parts:

1. Italy is the first country regarding the number of blue helmets.
2. Italy is the eighth contributor to the world as regards the budget of peace missions.

Let's break down these points:

1. **Number of Blue Helmets**: As of recent data, Italy has been one of the top contributors of troops to UN peacekeeping missions. While the exact ranking can fluctuate, Italy has historically been among the leading countries in terms of troop contributions.

2. **Budget Contribution**: Italy is indeed one of the significant financial contributors to UN peacekeeping missions. The UN peacekeeping budget is primarily funded by member states, and Italy is typically among the top contributors.

Given the available data, while Italy is a significant contributor in both troops and budget, the exact rankings can change. The claim seems generally accurate but may not be precise in terms of the exact rankings at any given time. Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly true but not entirely precise.

While soursop leaf tea has potential health benefits, it can also have side effects, especially when consumed in large amounts. Some reported side effects include nausea, vomiting, and even neurotoxic effects in extreme cases. Therefore, the claim that it has no side effects and can be consumed without limit is not true.

"""Before 2011 we exported US $ 6,000 million fuels and then we began to import the same figure""",half true,es,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Historical Data on Exports and Imports**: We need to verify the specific figures for fuel exports and imports before and after 2011.
2. **Context and Country**: The claim does not specify the country, which is crucial for verification. Different countries have different export and import patterns for fuels.
3. **Consistency Over Time**: The claim suggests a significant shift from exporting to importing the same amount of fuels. This would require checking continuous data trends to see if such a shift occurred around 2011.

Without specific data and context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, dramatic shifts in fuel trade patterns are typically well-documented and would be reflected in economic reports and trade statistics.

Given the lack of specific data and context, the claim appears to be a generalization that might not accurately reflect the trade dynamics of any particular country. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim is likely an exaggeration or oversimplification.

"""Argentina is already one of the countries with the highest poverty index in Latin America""",false,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""Argentina is already one of the countries with the highest poverty index in Latin America,"" we need to consider recent data on poverty rates across the region.

As of recent reports, Argentina does have a significant poverty rate. According to various sources, including the World Bank and national statistics, Argentina's poverty rate has been relatively high compared to other countries in Latin America. For example, in 2021, the poverty rate in Argentina was reported to be around 40%, which is higher than the average for the region.

However, it's important to note that other countries in the region, such as Haiti and Venezuela, have even higher poverty rates. Therefore, while Argentina does have a high poverty rate, it is not necessarily at the very top when compared to all countries in Latin America.

Given this context, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but not entirely precise.

With this law Italy is already today the country that gives more citizenships to foreign citizens throughout Europe,half true,it,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""With this law Italy is already today the country that gives more citizenships to foreign citizens throughout Europe,"" we would need to look at current statistics on naturalization rates across European countries. As of my last update, Italy has been one of the leading countries in Europe in terms of granting citizenship, but it is not necessarily the top country in Europe for this metric.

Countries like France and Germany also grant a significant number of citizenships annually. The claim that Italy grants the most citizenships would need to be supported by the most recent data, which is not provided in the statement.

Given the lack of specific data in the claim and the knowledge that several countries have high naturalization rates, the claim is likely an overstatement.

Since I don't have access to real-time data or the ability to search the internet, I'll provide a methodological approach for how you could verify this claim:

1. **Check Official Government Reports**: Look for labor market reports or employment statistics from the government or official statistical agencies for the year 2018.
2. **Review Independent Studies**: Consult reports from reputable organizations that monitor labor markets, such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) or local economic research institutions.
3. **Verify with News Articles**: Check news articles from reliable sources that discuss employment data for 2018.

Without specific data to verify the claim, I cannot definitively categorize its accuracy. However, based on the methodological approach outlined, if the data aligns closely with the claim, it might be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True.' If there are significant discrepancies, it might be 'Half True,' 'Mostly False,' or 'False.'

Young Italians on the run: how many and why?,true,it,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim ""Young Italians on the run: how many and why?"", we need more context or specific data. The phrase itself is not a claim that can be directly verified as true or false without additional information. It is more of a headline or a topic for discussion rather than a factual statement.

However, if we assume that the claim is suggesting a significant number of young Italians are leaving the country and there are reasons behind this trend, then we can evaluate it based on available data and reports.

According to various sources, there has been a notable trend of young Italians leaving the country in recent years due to factors such as economic instability, high unemployment rates, and limited job opportunities. This trend has been widely reported and supported by data from institutions like Eurostat and the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT).

Based on this information, the claim that ""Young Italians are on the run"" in significant numbers and for specific reasons is generally supported by available data.

The claim seems to suggest that a significant portion (36%) of computers have already dropped, but it lacks specific details about what ""dropped"" means in this context. Without additional information about the nature of the ""drop"" (e.g., sales, performance, availability), it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.

Given the ambiguity and lack of context, the claim cannot be fully verified as true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

"Senegal has reduced its 50%malnutrition rate, according to the director for Africa for the international Food Policy Research Institute (IFRI).",half true,fr,"To evaluate the claim that ""Senegal has reduced its 50% malnutrition rate,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Initial Malnutrition Rate**: The claim states that the malnutrition rate was 50%. We need to verify if this rate was accurate at some point.
2. **Reduction in Malnutrition Rate**: The claim suggests that there has been a reduction. We need to check if there has indeed been a reduction and by how much.

According to available data from reputable sources like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Senegal has made significant progress in reducing malnutrition rates. However, the specific claim that the malnutrition rate was 50% and has been reduced needs verification.

- **WHO and UNICEF Data**: These organizations report that malnutrition rates in Senegal have been declining over the years, but the exact figures can vary. For instance, stunting (a key indicator of malnutrition) has decreased from around 27% in 2005 to about 19% in 2017.
- **IFPRI Reports**: The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has also acknowledged improvements in Senegal's nutrition status, but specific claims about a 50% malnutrition rate and its reduction need to be cross-verified with detailed reports.

Given the general trend of improvement in malnutrition rates in Senegal, the claim is likely true in essence, but the specific figures may not be entirely accurate. Therefore, the claim is mostly true but may not be completely precise.

"Italian companies are not ""the most taxed in the world""",half true,it,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Italian companies are not 'the most taxed in the world,'"" we need to consider the available data on corporate tax rates and overall tax burdens globally.

According to various sources, including the OECD and other international tax organizations, Italy does have a relatively high corporate tax rate compared to many other countries. However, it is not accurate to say that Italian companies are ""the most taxed in the world."" There are other countries with higher corporate tax rates and overall tax burdens.

For example, countries like the United Arab Emirates and some African nations have higher corporate tax rates or other tax burdens that can make them more heavily taxed than Italy. Additionally, the overall tax burden on companies can be influenced by various factors beyond just the corporate tax rate, such as social security contributions, value-added taxes, and other levies.

Given this context, the claim that ""Italian companies are not 'the most taxed in the world'"" is mostly accurate, as Italy is not at the very top of the list for corporate tax burdens globally.

Next, let's check the current number of miner jobs. As of the most recent data, the number of jobs in the mining industry is around 200,000 to 250,000, not almost half a million.

Therefore, while the number of miner jobs has increased since 2003, it has not reached almost half a million.

Different countries have varying numbers of consulates in the United States. Without this context, it's impossible to definitively say whether the statement is true or false.

However, assuming the claim is made by a specific country, we would need to verify the number of consulates that country has in the United States. If the country indeed has five consulates, the claim would be true. If the number is significantly different, the claim could range from mostly true to false depending on the discrepancy.

However, without specific data or context on the actual expenditure, the deficit, and how they are related, it is challenging to definitively classify the claim. If the statement is based on verifiable data showing that the lower expenditure for citizenship income does not contribute to the deficit, then it could be considered true or mostly true.

"Senegal, the leading producer of salt, West Africa, however matters a quarter of its consumption.",mostly true,fr,"The claim that Senegal is the leading producer of salt in West Africa but imports a quarter of its consumption is complex and requires verification of several components.

1. **Leading Producer of Salt in West Africa**: Senegal is known for its salt production, particularly from Lac Rose (Lake Retba). While it is a significant producer in the region, confirming it as the leading producer would require specific data on production volumes compared to other West African countries.

2. **Imports a Quarter of Its Consumption**: This part of the claim suggests that despite being a significant producer, Senegal still imports a substantial portion of the salt it consumes. This could be due to various factors such as domestic demand outstripping production, quality differences, or trade dynamics.

Without specific data to verify the exact proportions and rankings, it is challenging to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false. However, given Senegal's known salt production and the plausibility of the import situation, the claim likely contains elements of truth but may not be entirely accurate without further data.

One in five Nigerian suffers from long -term depression.,false,fr,"To evaluate the claim ""One in five Nigerians suffers from long-term depression,"" we need to consider available data and research on mental health in Nigeria.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health disorders, including depression, are significant health concerns in Nigeria. However, the prevalence rates can vary depending on the study and methodology used.

The WHO estimates that globally, about 5% of adults suffer from depression. In Nigeria, studies have shown varying rates of depression, but a commonly cited figure is around 3.9% for major depressive disorder. While the prevalence of depression is a serious issue, the claim that ""one in five Nigerians"" (which would be 20%) suffers from long-term depression is likely an overestimation based on available data.

Therefore, the claim that ""one in five Nigerians suffers from long-term depression"" is not supported by the most reliable and widely accepted research.

"«[The Minister of Economy and Finance Roberto Gualtieri] has just announced that if you are in backlog with payments they can seal the accounts.In my opinion we are at the Soviet tax union because we are in the tax police state """,half true,it,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the policies related to tax collection and enforcement in Italy under the Minister of Economy and Finance Roberto Gualtieri.

The statement suggests that the government can ""seal the accounts"" of those who are in backlog with payments, which is a measure often associated with strong enforcement actions. The claim also equates this with a ""Soviet tax union"" and a ""tax police state,"" implying extreme and oppressive measures.

In Italy, the tax authority (Agenzia delle Entrate) does have the power to take enforcement actions against tax debtors, including freezing bank accounts (known as ""pignoramento del conto corrente""). This is a standard practice in many countries to ensure tax compliance and recover unpaid taxes.

However, equating this with a ""Soviet tax union"" or a ""tax police state"" is hyperbolic and misleading. While the enforcement actions can be severe, they are within the legal framework and are not unique to Italy. Many democratic countries have similar measures to ensure tax compliance.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**

The claim exaggerates the nature of the enforcement actions and mischaracterizes them as being akin to an oppressive regime. While the government can take strong actions against tax debtors, these actions are within the bounds of the law and are not indicative of a ""tax police state.""",,False,True

"""The Dublin regulation, penalizing for Italy, is not abolished but remains in force and the principle of reception for the countries of first entrance remains intact with serious prejudice for Italy""",half true,it,"The Dublin Regulation, which determines the EU Member State responsible for examining an asylum application, does indeed place a significant burden on countries like Italy, which are often the first point of entry for migrants. The regulation has been a source of controversy and debate, with Italy and other frontline states advocating for a more equitable distribution of responsibility.

However, the claim that the Dublin Regulation remains unchanged and that the principle of reception for the countries of first entrance remains intact is not entirely accurate. There have been efforts and proposals to reform the Dublin Regulation to address these imbalances, although progress has been slow and contentious.

Given the ongoing discussions and attempts at reform, while the Dublin Regulation remains in force, it is not entirely accurate to say that it is unchanged or that the principle of reception for the countries of first entrance remains completely intact without acknowledging the reform efforts.

Women carry the male DNA of all those with whom they have had intimate relationships,false,fr,"The claim that ""Women carry the male DNA of all those with whom they have had intimate relationships"" is largely misleading and oversimplified. While it is true that male DNA can be found in a woman's body after sexual intercourse, this DNA does not permanently integrate into the woman's own genetic material. The presence of male DNA is typically transient and does not mean that a woman carries the male DNA indefinitely or that it becomes a part of her own genetic makeup.

Without direct access to the specific white paper or other official documents from the Senegalese government, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of these claims. Therefore, the evaluation must be based on the general reliability of government reports and any available secondary sources.

Given the lack of specific verification, the most cautious approach is to consider the claim as partially verifiable but not fully confirmed.

As of the most recent data available, Chile's per capita income is indeed higher than Brazil's, but it is not quite double. According to various economic indicators, Chile's per capita income is typically around 1.5 to 1.8 times that of Brazil, not double.

Therefore, the claim that Chile's per capita income is almost double that of Brazil is somewhat exaggerated.

Really in the room bars and restaurants don't accept the ATM?,half true,it,"The claim 'Really in the room bars and restaurants don't accept the ATM?' is somewhat ambiguous because ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) are not typically used for direct transactions in bars and restaurants. Instead, they are used to withdraw cash, which can then be used for payments. However, many bars and restaurants do accept debit and credit cards, which can be accessed through ATMs.

Given this context, the claim is misleading because it seems to misunderstand the function of ATMs in relation to bars and restaurants.

In 2018, the European Parliament did vote to lift Marine Le Pen's immunity over tweets she had posted in 2015 that included graphic images of ISIS violence. However, the lifting of immunity does not automatically imply guilt; it allows for investigations or prosecutions to proceed under the relevant national laws.

"90 % of the country mayors have a salary of less than 300,000 CFA francs.",half true,fr,"To evaluate the claim '90% of the country mayors have a salary of less than 300,000 CFA francs,' we need reliable data on the salaries of mayors in the country. Without specific data or sources to verify this claim, it is challenging to provide an accurate assessment. However, based on typical salary ranges for public officials and the general distribution of salaries, we can make an educated guess.

If the claim aligns closely with available data or reasonable expectations based on similar positions, it might be considered 'Mostly True.' If the data shows significant deviation but some truth, it might be 'Half True.' If the data contradicts the claim but shows some minor truth, it might be 'Mostly False.' If the data completely contradicts the claim, it would be 'False.'

Without specific data, the most neutral position would be to assume some level of truth but with a degree of uncertainty.

We can do it if we arrive before others to respond to the needs of the 900 thousand single mothers of our country whose half of which risks poverty and certainly more in difficulty than the other mothers,true,it,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two main points: the number of single mothers and the proportion at risk of poverty.

1. **Number of Single Mothers**: The claim states there are 900,000 single mothers. Without specific data, we can't verify this number, but it's plausible.
2. **Proportion at Risk of Poverty**: The claim suggests half of these mothers are at risk of poverty. This is more challenging to verify without specific data, but it's known that single-parent households, particularly those headed by women, are at a higher risk of poverty.

Without specific data to confirm the exact numbers, the claim seems to mix verifiable trends (single mothers facing higher poverty risks) with unverified specifics (900,000 single mothers, half at risk of poverty). Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but lacks precise verification.

While it's true that alcohol is flammable and could potentially ignite under specific conditions, the scenario described in the warning is highly unlikely. Here's why:

1. The amount of alcohol that would remain on a key after sanitizing is minimal and would evaporate quickly, especially in the open air of a garage.
2. Car ignition systems are designed to prevent sparks from occurring outside the ignition chamber. The electrical system in modern cars is low voltage and wouldn't typically produce sparks that could ignite alcohol vapors.
3. There are no credible reports or evidence to support the claim that numerous accidents or fires have occurred due to sanitizing car keys with alcohol.

While it's always important to be cautious with flammable substances, the specific scenario described in the warning is improbable. Always fact-check such claims to avoid spreading misinformation.",,False,True

Without specific data or context, it's impossible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume that we have access to reliable data that places the capital in question as the third best rated.

If the data supports the claim, then the statement would be true. If the data shows that the capital is not the third best rated, then the statement would be false. Given the lack of specific information, a conservative approach would be to consider the claim as ""Half True"" until further verification.

Without this context, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is implying that Salvini is omitting important information about these regions, we can proceed with an analysis based on general guidelines for fact-checking.

1. **True**: The claim is entirely accurate and supported by factual evidence.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim is largely accurate but may contain minor inaccuracies or omissions.
3. **Half True**: The claim contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate information.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim is largely inaccurate but may contain some elements of truth.
5. **False**: The claim is entirely inaccurate and not supported by factual evidence.

Given the lack of specific context or evidence provided in the claim, it is challenging to assign a definitive truth value. However, if the claim is suggesting that Salvini is intentionally omitting information, it would lean towards being speculative without concrete evidence.

"Young people die especially for road accidents, but less and less",true,it,"To evaluate the claim ""Young people die especially for road accidents, but less and less,"" we need to consider two main points: whether young people are particularly at risk from road accidents and whether the number of such deaths is decreasing over time.

1. **Young people die especially for road accidents:**
   - According to various studies and reports, young people, particularly those between the ages of 15 to 29, are indeed at a higher risk of dying from road accidents compared to other age groups. This is often attributed to factors like inexperience, risk-taking behavior, and lack of safety awareness.

2. **Less and less:**
   - There is evidence that road safety measures, improved vehicle technology, and awareness campaigns have led to a decrease in road accident fatalities in many countries. However, the rate of decrease can vary significantly depending on the region and specific demographic factors.

Given these points, the claim that young people are at particular risk from road accidents is generally true, and the trend of a decreasing number of such deaths is also supported by data in many contexts. However, without specific data to quantify the exact trend, the claim can be considered mostly accurate.

"The heirs of Léopold Sédar Senghor perceive, per year, more than a billion FCFA for the copyright of the National Hymn of Senegal.",half true,fr,"To evaluate the claim that ""The heirs of Léopold Sédar Senghor perceive, per year, more than a billion FCFA for the copyright of the National Hymn of Senegal,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Verifiability**: There is no publicly available, verified information that confirms the exact amount of royalties received by the heirs of Léopold Sédar Senghor for the copyright of the National Hymn of Senegal.

2. **Context**: While it is known that Léopold Sédar Senghor wrote the lyrics of the Senegalese national anthem, specific details about royalty payments to his heirs are not widely documented or publicly disclosed.

3. **Plausibility**: The amount of one billion FCFA (approximately 1.7 million USD) per year seems unusually high for royalties from a national anthem, especially considering that national anthems are generally used in contexts where royalty payments might not be standard or significant.

Given the lack of verifiable sources and the implausibility of the claimed amount, the statement appears to be exaggerated or unfounded.

"""The collective work conventions were 200 in 2002 and now they are approximately 1500""",true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""The collective work conventions were 200 in 2002 and now they are approximately 1500,"" we need to consider the context and available data regarding collective work conventions or agreements. Collective work conventions typically refer to agreements between employers and trade unions that outline terms and conditions of employment.

Without specific data on the exact number of collective work conventions in 2002 and the present, it's challenging to verify the claim precisely. However, assuming the claim is based on some form of reliable data or reporting, the significant increase from 200 to 1500 suggests a substantial growth in these conventions over the years.

Given the lack of precise data, but acknowledging the possibility of a substantial increase, the claim can be considered plausible but not definitively verifiable. Therefore, the claim is likely 'Mostly True' based on the general trend of increased collective agreements over time.

"“There are 800 thousand pensions for more disability.They are more than the dead of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Poland, Greece and the Netherlands together in World War II ”",false,es,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two main points: the number of disability pensions and the combined number of deaths for the specified countries during World War II.

1. **Disability Pensions:** The claim states there are 800,000 disability pensions. Without a specific context or country, it's challenging to verify this number. However, let's assume this number is accurate for the sake of argument.

2. **World War II Deaths:** The combined deaths for the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Poland, Greece, and the Netherlands during World War II are approximately:
   - United States: 405,399
   - United Kingdom: 450,700
   - France: 567,600
   - Poland: 5,600,000 (This number includes both military and civilian deaths, with the civilian deaths being significantly higher due to the Holocaust and other atrocities.)
   - Greece: 477,500
   - Netherlands: 301,314

   Adding these together: 405,399 + 450,700 + 567,600 + 5,600,000 + 477,500 + 301,314 = approximately 7,802,513 deaths.

Given that the total number of deaths (7,802,513) is significantly higher than the number of disability pensions (800,000), the claim is false.

The PMI is a key indicator of manufacturing activity, with a reading below 50 indicating contraction.

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to the latest data. However, I can guide you on how to verify this claim:

1. **Check the latest PMI reports**: Look at the monthly PMI reports for Italy from a reputable source like IHS Markit.
2. **Review the trend**: Ensure that for the past 11 months, the PMI readings have been consistently below 50.
3. **Cross-reference with other sources**: Confirm the trend with other economic indicators or news reports that discuss Italian manufacturing activity.

If the data aligns with the claim, it would be 'True'. If there is some discrepancy but the overall trend supports contraction, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the data is mixed or inconclusive, it could be 'Half True'. If the data contradicts the claim significantly, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

"""The mayor received in this pandemic, data from the 16th, R $ 153 million and he only managed to spend 29.5% of these resources actually paid.""",true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to assess the accuracy of the figures provided and the context in which they are presented. The statement says that the mayor received R$ 153 million and spent only 29.5% of these resources.

Let's break down the calculation:
- Total amount received: R$ 153 million
- Percentage spent: 29.5%

To find out how much was actually spent, we calculate:
\[ 29.5\% \times 153,000,000 = 0.295 \times 153,000,000 = 45,135,000 \]

So, according to the claim, the mayor spent R$ 45,135,000 out of R$ 153,000,000.

Without additional context or external verification, the claim appears to be mathematically consistent. However, to fully verify the claim, we would need to confirm the actual amounts received and spent by the mayor through reliable sources.

Given the information provided, the claim seems plausible but requires further verification for complete accuracy.

"""Inail's latest data say that 300 people a day in Italy are infected in the workplace and ten die.And the Lockdown has only loosened for a week """,false,it,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the source of the data (Inail, the Italian Workers' Compensation Authority) and the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.

The claim states that according to Inail's latest data, 300 people a day in Italy are infected in the workplace and ten die, and that this has occurred after the lockdown has only loosened for a week.

Without specific dates or direct access to Inail's data at the time of this claim, we can't verify the exact numbers. However, we can consider the plausibility based on general trends and reports.

1. **Inail Data**: Inail does report on workplace infections and deaths related to COVID-19. The numbers given (300 infections and 10 deaths per day) would need to be cross-referenced with official reports from that specific time period.

2. **Timing**: The claim mentions that the lockdown has only loosened for a week. This suggests a very recent change in policy, which could be a factor in sudden shifts in infection rates.

3. **General Trends**: During the early phases of lockdown easing, there can be fluctuations in infection rates, but such high numbers immediately after a week of loosening restrictions would be unusual without a significant outbreak.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact numbers, the claim can be considered plausible but not fully verifiable without additional context. Therefore, it is likely 'Mostly True' if the numbers align closely with Inail's reports for that specific period.

Chemical castration as a punishment for convicted rapists has indeed been proposed and even implemented in some jurisdictions around the world. For example, several states in the United States, such as Alabama, have considered or passed such legislation.

However, without specific details about the jurisdiction or the current status of the bill, it's difficult to definitively say whether the claim is entirely true. If the claim is made in a context where such a bill exists or has been proposed, it could be considered true or mostly true. If the claim is made without any basis in a specific legislative context, it could be considered false or mostly false.

Given the general nature of the claim and the known existence of such proposals in various jurisdictions, I would rate it as:

However, generally speaking, if the claim is based on recent trends and official statistics showing an increase in childhood vaccinations in Veneto, it could be considered true or mostly true. If the data is inconclusive or shows marginal changes, it might be half true. If the data indicates a decrease or no significant change, it could be mostly false or false.

Since I don't have access to real-time data or specific statistics, I cannot provide a definitive answer. For the sake of this example, let's assume the claim aligns with recent data showing an increase in vaccinations among children in Veneto.

According to various reports and data, including those from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other international organizations, the share of renewable energy in Africa's electricity production capacity has been increasing but remains relatively low. As of recent data, the percentage of renewable energy in Africa's electricity production capacity is indeed lower than in many other regions, but the exact figure can vary depending on the source and the year of the data.

While the claim that renewable energies represent only 18% of the current electricity production capacity of Africa may not be precisely accurate for the most recent data, it is generally true that the share of renewable energy is relatively low. Therefore, the statement is mostly accurate but could be slightly off in terms of the exact percentage.

37 health posts were closed in full pandemic in Curitiba,mostly true,pt,"To verify the claim ""37 health posts were closed in full pandemic in Curitiba,"" I would need to check recent, reliable sources such as official government reports, local news articles, or statements from municipal health authorities. Since I don't have real-time access to these sources, I cannot provide a definitive answer.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume I have checked these sources and found the following information:

- Official municipal reports confirm that a number of health posts were temporarily closed or had their services reduced during the pandemic.
- Local news articles mention that 37 health posts were indeed affected, but they were not entirely shut down; instead, their services were scaled back or temporarily suspended due to safety concerns and staff reallocation to COVID-19 response efforts.

Based on this hypothetical research, the claim is not entirely false but exaggerates the situation by stating the health posts were ""closed.""

"A reissue of the London trio debut album, 2009, included U ......",mostly true,pt,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need more context about the specific London trio and their debut album from 2009. Without additional information, such as the name of the band and the title of the debut album, it's not possible to verify the claim accurately.

However, if we assume the claim refers to a well-known London trio and their debut album from 2009, and the statement mentions a reissue including a specific track or feature (represented by 'U ......'), the claim could be evaluated based on known facts about that band and album.

For example, if the claim is about a band like The xx and their debut album ""xx"" from 2009, and it mentions a reissue including a specific track or feature, we would need to check if such a reissue exists and if it includes the mentioned feature.

Without specific details, the claim cannot be accurately evaluated. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be:

True: the vaccine law works,true,it,"To evaluate the claim ""True: the vaccine law works,"" we need to consider several factors such as the specific context, the goals of the vaccine law, and the evidence supporting its effectiveness. Without additional context or data, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim refers to a general vaccine law aimed at increasing vaccination rates and reducing disease prevalence, we can make an educated assessment.

1. **Context**: Different countries and regions have different vaccine laws with varying degrees of success.
2. **Goals**: The primary goals of vaccine laws are typically to increase vaccination rates and reduce the spread of preventable diseases.
3. **Evidence**: Studies and data often show that vaccine laws can be effective in increasing vaccination rates and reducing disease outbreaks. However, the effectiveness can vary based on implementation, enforcement, and public acceptance.

Given these points, it is reasonable to say that vaccine laws generally work to some extent, but they may not be universally effective in all contexts.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I will outline the steps you should take to verify this claim:

1. **Check Official Reports**: Look for annual reports or financial statements released by the EPTC (Engineering and Public Transport Company) or the relevant government agency.

2. **Media Coverage**: Review news articles and press releases that discuss the EPTC's earnings from traffic fines.

3. **Government Websites**: Visit the official website of the EPTC or the local government to find any published data on traffic fine revenues.

4. **Independent Studies**: Look for studies or reports from independent organizations that might have analyzed the EPTC's financial performance.

Based on the information available and the steps outlined, if there is strong evidence from official sources that the EPTC earned $80 million in traffic fines last year, the claim would be considered 'True'. If there is partial evidence but some discrepancies, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the evidence is mixed and inconclusive, it would be 'Half True'. If the evidence suggests the claim is largely incorrect, it would be 'Mostly False'. If there is no evidence to support the claim, it would be 'False'.

1. **""Senegal is one of the 5 countries at risk of low over-indebtedness in the African Union.""**
2. **""Among the ECOWAS member countries, Senegal is the only one at risk of low over-indebtedness.""**

Without specific data or sources to verify these claims directly, we can analyze the general context and plausibility of the statements.

1. **African Union (AU)**: The African Union comprises 55 member states. Assessing debt risk involves considering various economic indicators and reports from international financial institutions like the IMF or World Bank. If Senegal is indeed one of the 5 countries at risk of low over-indebtedness within the AU, this part of the claim could be plausible but requires verification from a reputable source.

2. **ECOWAS**: The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) consists of 15 member countries. Claiming that Senegal is the ""only one"" at risk of low over-indebtedness among these countries is a strong statement that would need specific and recent data to support. It is less likely that only one country in a region would face such a unique risk profile.

Given the lack of specific data and the strong nature of the second claim, the overall statement seems somewhat exaggerated and not fully verifiable without additional information.

Without specific data for the most recent periods, it's challenging to provide an exact comparison. However, based on general knowledge and historical trends:

"""[The economy] has been stagnant for 8 years""",true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""[The economy] has been stagnant for 8 years,"" we need to consider multiple economic indicators such as GDP growth, employment rates, inflation, and other relevant metrics over the specified period.

1. **GDP Growth**: If the GDP has shown little to no growth over the 8-year period, this would support the claim of stagnation.
2. **Employment Rates**: If unemployment rates have remained consistently high or have not improved significantly, this could indicate stagnation.
3. **Inflation**: If inflation rates have been stable or low, it might suggest economic stagnation, especially if combined with low growth in other areas.
4. **Other Indicators**: Wage growth, productivity, and business investment trends would also need to be considered.

Without specific data for the 8-year period in question, a general assessment can be made based on typical economic trends over such a timeframe:

- It is unusual for an economy to be completely stagnant for an extended period like 8 years, as economies typically experience cycles of growth and recession.
- Even during periods of slow growth, there are usually fluctuations and changes in various economic indicators that would not support a claim of complete stagnation.

Given these considerations, the claim that the economy has been stagnant for 8 years is likely an oversimplification and does not account for the nuances and fluctuations that typically occur in economic performance over such a period.

1. **Cost of the European Parliament in 2014**: The claim states that the European Parliament cost 1,737 billion in 2014. This figure seems unusually high, as the typical budget for the European Parliament is in the range of billions, not trillions.

2. **Growth by over 300 million in 5 years**: This part of the claim suggests an increase in the budget. To verify this, we would need to compare the budgets from 2014 and 2019.

3. **Cost of the double seat in Strasbourg**: The claim asserts that maintaining the Strasbourg seat costs taxpayers almost 200 million a year, which is equivalent to about 10 percent of the Parliament's budget.

Let's address each point:

1. **Cost of the European Parliament in 2014**: According to official sources, the budget for the European Parliament in 2014 was around €1.75 billion, not €1,737 billion. This is a significant discrepancy.

2. **Growth by over 300 million in 5 years**: The budget for the European Parliament did increase over the years, but the exact amount would need to be verified with official budget documents. However, the starting figure is incorrect, which casts doubt on the subsequent calculation.

3. **Cost of the double seat in Strasbourg**: The cost of maintaining the Strasbourg seat has been a topic of debate, and estimates vary. However, the claim that it costs almost 200 million a year and represents about 10 percent of the Parliament's budget is plausible but should be confirmed with official sources.

"""[In the decrees"" relaunch ""and"" Cura Italia ""] what does Covid have to do with the extension of the airport concession of Fiumicino to the Benetton, which is worth a gift from over one billion?""(min. 6:11)",half true,it,"The claim seems to suggest that the Italian government's COVID-19 relief decrees, specifically ""relaunch"" and ""Cura Italia,"" included an extension of the airport concession for Fiumicino to the Benetton family, implying that this extension was a gift worth over one billion euros and was somehow related to COVID-19.

To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main points:

1. **Relation to COVID-19**: The decrees ""relaunch"" and ""Cura Italia"" were emergency measures aimed at addressing the economic and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. They included various provisions to support businesses, workers, and the healthcare system.

2. **Airport Concession Extension**: The extension of the airport concession for Fiumicino to Atlantia, a company controlled by the Benetton family, has been a contentious issue in Italian politics. However, this issue predates the COVID-19 pandemic and is not directly related to the emergency measures taken in response to the pandemic.

Given these points, while it is true that the airport concession extension has been a controversial topic, it is not accurate to say that it was part of the COVID-19 relief decrees or that it was a direct result of the pandemic.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**

The claim misleadingly connects the airport concession extension to the COVID-19 relief decrees, implying a direct relationship that does not exist. While the extension has been a contentious issue, it is not accurate to present it as a gift related to the pandemic response.",,False,True

However, since I don't have real-time access to external data, I can't verify the claim directly. Typically, budget bills are complex and can include various provisions that might not be immediately apparent.

M5S/Lega wanted to reduce the tax burden: did they do it?,true,it,"To evaluate the claim that the M5S/Lega coalition in Italy wanted to reduce the tax burden and whether they did it, we need to consider the policies they proposed and the outcomes of those policies.

During their time in government, the M5S (Five Star Movement) and Lega (League) coalition did introduce several measures aimed at reducing the tax burden. One notable policy was the introduction of the ""flat tax"" regime for self-employed workers and small businesses, which simplified the tax system and reduced the tax rate for certain categories of taxpayers. Additionally, they proposed and implemented other tax reductions and incentives aimed at stimulating the economy.

However, the overall impact of these measures on the tax burden for the broader population is more complex. While some taxpayers benefited from the changes, others may not have seen significant reductions, and the overall fiscal impact varied across different sectors and income levels.

Given these factors, the claim can be considered ""Mostly True"" because the M5S/Lega coalition did implement policies aimed at reducing the tax burden, but the extent and effectiveness of these reductions varied.

Without additional context or specific statements from Salvini, it is difficult to provide a precise evaluation.

However, chemical castration is a controversial topic with varying opinions among experts, politicians, and the public. Advocates may argue that it can reduce recidivism among sex offenders, while critics point to ethical concerns, potential side effects, and questions about its effectiveness.

Given the lack of specific context and the complex nature of the topic, a general evaluation might be:

Senegal is the 5th African country in the fight against malaria.,true,fr,"To evaluate the claim ""Senegal is the 5th African country in the fight against malaria,"" we need to consider the context and available data on malaria prevention and control efforts in African countries.

Malaria is a significant public health issue in Africa, and various countries have implemented strategies to combat the disease. These efforts include vector control measures, distribution of insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, and access to antimalarial drugs.

However, determining the exact ranking of Senegal in the fight against malaria would require specific criteria and data points, such as reduction in malaria cases, mortality rates, and the implementation of prevention and control measures. Without access to such detailed and up-to-date data, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately.

Given the lack of specific data to support or refute the claim, it is reasonable to consider the statement as potentially accurate but not definitively proven. Therefore, the claim can be categorized as:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False

Without additional context or specific details about the event, organization, or timeframe, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim.

However, if we assume that ""international transparency"" refers to a reputable organization or conference focused on transparency and anti-corruption measures, it is plausible that such an entity could produce a substantial number of proposals. International organizations often generate numerous recommendations and proposals as part of their work.

Given the lack of specific details but the plausibility of the claim, the most accurate assessment would be:

The claim suggests that Haddad is falsely presenting a photo from the Carnival of Salvador as being from a different event, referred to as ""the turn."" Without specific evidence or context, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim.

However, based on the general nature of such accusations and the lack of verifiable information provided in the claim itself, it is likely that the claim is either exaggerated or misleading. Therefore, without concrete evidence to support the accusation, the claim appears to be:

Without specific data, we can only make an educated guess based on general trends.

However, since I don't have access to real-time data or specific reports, I'll provide a hypothetical assessment. If the claim aligns closely with known statistics and is supported by credible sources, it could be considered 'Mostly True.' If there are significant discrepancies or the data is not well-supported, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the claim is generally supported by available data but may have some minor discrepancies.

"The public sector finances less than 50 % of health spending in West Africa, a West African expert recently said.",true,fr,"To evaluate the claim that ""the public sector finances less than 50% of health spending in West Africa,"" we need to look at reliable data sources that track health expenditures in the region.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health financing reports, many countries in West Africa indeed have a significant portion of their health spending financed by the private sector, including out-of-pocket payments by individuals. For instance, in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and others, the public sector's contribution to health spending is often below 50%.

However, the specific percentage can vary by country, and some countries may have a higher public sector contribution. On average, though, the claim aligns with general trends observed in the region.

"China finances infrastructure projects in Africa more than the BAD, the EU, the SFI, the World Bank and the G8 combined.",true,fr,"To evaluate the claim, let's consider the available data on Chinese investments in African infrastructure compared to other major financiers such as the African Development Bank (BAD), the European Union (EU), the International Finance Corporation (IFC, part of the World Bank Group), the World Bank, and the G8 countries.

### Key Facts:
1. **Chinese Investment**: China has been a major investor in African infrastructure over the past two decades. According to various reports, China's investments and loans in Africa have been substantial, particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and other bilateral arrangements.

2. **African Development Bank (BAD)**: The African Development Bank has also been a significant financier of infrastructure projects in Africa.

3. **European Union (EU)**: The EU provides substantial aid and investment in Africa, often focusing on infrastructure, governance, and development projects.

4. **International Finance Corporation (IFC)**: The IFC, as part of the World Bank Group, also finances numerous infrastructure projects in Africa.

5. **World Bank**: The World Bank is one of the largest financiers of development projects globally, including in Africa.

6. **G8 Countries**: The G8 countries (now G7) have been involved in various development initiatives in Africa, including infrastructure projects.

### Comparative Analysis:
- **China's Investment**: Estimates suggest that China's investment in African infrastructure has been significant, but it is not clear if it surpasses the combined efforts of all the other mentioned entities.
- **Other Financiers**: The combined efforts of the BAD, EU, IFC, World Bank, and G8 countries also amount to substantial investments in African infrastructure.

### Conclusion:
While China's investment in Africa is significant, claiming that it exceeds the combined efforts of the BAD, EU, IFC, World Bank, and G8 countries is likely an overstatement. The combined financial power and investment from these multilateral and bilateral sources are substantial and likely outweigh China's investment when considered together.

1. The specific context or event being referred to (e.g., which country, which default, which ads).
2. Verifiable data or reports that support the US $35 billion figure.

"""Social spending grew by 43.5%, that means that the investment towards those who have the least is what grew most in the budget""",false,es,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the precise data behind the statement. The claim states that ""Social spending grew by 43.5%, that means that the investment towards those who have the least is what grew most in the budget.""

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify the exact figures and comparisons. However, the claim hinges on two main points:
1. Social spending grew by 43.5%.
2. This growth represents the largest increase in the budget.

If the data supports that social spending did indeed increase by 43.5%, and this increase is the largest among all categories in the budget, then the claim would be accurate.

However, without access to the actual budget data or a reliable source to verify these figures, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the most prudent assessment would be to consider it partially verifiable based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the Parties Supporting Dilma Rousseff**: During Dilma's presidency, her coalition included parties like the PT (Workers' Party), PMDB (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party), PSB (Brazilian Socialist Party), and others.

2. **Identify the Parties Supporting Geraldo Alckmin**: Geraldo Alckmin, who is currently affiliated with the PSDB (Brazilian Social Democracy Party), might have support from different parties depending on the political context and alliances.

3. **Compare the Two Groups**: If a majority of the parties that supported Dilma are now supporting Alckmin, the claim would be true. If only a few parties overlap, the claim would be false.

Without specific data, a general assessment based on historical trends and current political alignments in Brazil suggests that there might be some overlap, but it's unlikely that a majority of Dilma's supporters are now supporting Alckmin due to significant shifts in political alliances over the years.

Additionally, reports from the U.S. Census Bureau have shown that Nigerian immigrants have higher levels of educational attainment compared to the overall U.S. population.

However, the truth of this statement depends on the specific time of year and location being referred to, as weather patterns vary greatly across different regions and seasons.

In many regions, dry and windy conditions indeed increase the risk of wildfires, both natural and human-caused (which could include criminal activity). However, without a specific context (e.g., which time of year and where), it's difficult to say whether this statement is universally true.

2. **Specificity**: The claim refers to a specific action (use of public money to hire a cabinet employee for private service).
3. **Verifiability**: Legal decisions, especially those from high courts like the Federal Supreme Court, are typically well-documented and verifiable.

Given the structure of the claim, if the Federal Supreme Court indeed acquitted the individual of the specified charge, the claim would be true. However, without additional context or verification from official sources, it is challenging to definitively confirm the claim.

Italian prisons have a problem: they are the most overcrowded,true,it,"To evaluate the claim that ""Italian prisons have a problem: they are the most overcrowded,"" we need to consider the available data on prison overcrowding in Italy compared to other countries.

According to various reports and studies, including those from the Council of Europe and international human rights organizations, Italy does have a significant problem with prison overcrowding. However, determining if Italy has the ""most overcrowded"" prisons in the world requires a comparison with other countries.

In recent years, Italy has indeed been criticized for its high levels of prison overcrowding, with occupancy rates often exceeding the official capacity. However, other countries, such as those in certain regions of Africa, Asia, and South America, also face severe prison overcrowding issues.

Given this context, while Italy does have a serious problem with prison overcrowding, it is not accurate to say that it has the most overcrowded prisons in the world without more specific and comparative data. Therefore, the claim is more accurately characterized as ""Mostly True"" because it highlights a genuine issue but may not be entirely accurate in its superlative statement.

3. **Definition of ""Conjuncts""**: This term is not commonly used in a general context, so it might refer to a specific legal or administrative term within the country's framework.
4. **Interpretation of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers**: This suggests that the interpretation comes from a high-level government authority.

Given the lack of specific context or external verification, the claim appears to describe a plausible administrative action, where a ministry provides guidance to regional officials based on a higher authority's interpretation.

1. **Drug Consumption**: Many countries have seen an increase in drug use over recent years, driven by various factors such as economic stress, mental health issues, and availability.

2. **Weapon Sales**: Similarly, many countries have reported an increase in weapon sales, often due to factors like perceived increases in crime, political unrest, or cultural shifts.

1. **True**: The claim would be true if there is clear evidence that exactly two out of four points of the GDP of subsidies go to people who do not need it.
2. **Mostly True**: This would be the case if most of the data supports the claim but there might be some minor discrepancies.
3. **Half True**: If the data shows that some portion of the subsidies go to those who do not need it, but not necessarily two points out of four, the claim would be half true.
4. **Mostly False**: If the data shows that the majority of subsidies do not go to people who do not need it, the claim would be mostly false.
5. **False**: If there is no evidence or the evidence contradicts the claim entirely, it would be false.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, it's difficult to make a precise determination. However, based on general knowledge about subsidies and their aim to support those in need, it's likely that not all subsidies go to those who do not need it. Therefore, a balanced assessment might lean towards 'Half True' to acknowledge that some subsidies might be misallocated while others are not.

2. **German Constitution (Basic Law)**: The German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) was adopted in 1949 and has been amended numerous times since then. It is significantly shorter than the Italian Constitution.

Given these facts, the claim suggests a comparison of the ""words"" or length of these constitutions. The Italian Constitution is indeed much longer than the German Basic Law.

1. **Verification of Source**: Check if the claim comes from an official statement by Tiradentes University, a government report, or a reputable news outlet.
2. **Consistency with Past Data**: Compare the claimed budget with historical data, if available, to see if there's a significant discrepancy.
3. **Cross-Verification**: Look for multiple sources that corroborate the budget figure.

Since I don't have real-time access to external databases or the internet, I can't verify the claim directly. However, based on typical processes for evaluating such claims:

- If the claim is supported by official documents or multiple reliable sources, it would likely be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If there are inconsistencies or the claim is only partially supported by evidence, it would be 'Half True'.
- If the claim is largely unsupported or contradicted by reliable sources, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information, a conservative approach would be to consider the claim as 'Half True' until further verification.

By the end of his term, the unemployment rate was around 10.6%. Given Argentina's labor force at that time, this percentage would translate to approximately 2.3 million people being unemployed.

13.9 % of young girls are excised in Senegal.,half true,fr,"To evaluate the claim that '13.9% of young girls are excised in Senegal,' we need to rely on credible data sources. According to UNICEF's data from 2021, the prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM) among girls and women aged 15-49 in Senegal is approximately 25%. However, the prevalence among younger girls is lower due to recent efforts to reduce the practice.

Given that the claim specifies 'young girls,' it is important to note that the prevalence can vary by age group, and the most recent data suggests that the practice is declining among younger generations. While the exact figure of 13.9% is not widely reported in recent, credible sources, the claim is directionally accurate in suggesting a lower prevalence among younger girls compared to older age groups.

Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but may need further verification for the exact percentage.

"From Tav to Ilva, are the ""reverse"" of the M5S ""reverse"" in the dark of Italians ""?",false,it,"The statement 'From Tav to Ilva, are the ""reverse"" of the M5S ""reverse"" in the dark of Italians?' appears to be a claim about the political flip-flops of the Five Star Movement (M5S) in Italy regarding significant projects such as the TAV high-speed rail link and the Ilva steel plant.

**Analysis:**

1. **TAV (Treno Alta Velocità):** The M5S initially opposed the TAV project, particularly the Turin-Lyon high-speed rail link, but later changed its stance to support it. This reversal was widely publicized and criticized.

2. **Ilva Steel Plant:** The M5S had strong environmental concerns and initially opposed the continuation of the Ilva steel plant due to its pollution issues. However, the party eventually shifted its position to support the plant's operations under stricter environmental regulations.

Given these contexts, the claim suggests that the M5S has made significant policy reversals on these issues, and it implies that these reversals were done without transparency or clear communication to the Italian public.

**Evaluation:**

- The M5S did indeed reverse its positions on both the TAV and Ilva projects.
- The degree to which these reversals were ""in the dark of Italians"" is subjective and depends on the level of public communication and transparency from the M5S.

Considering the documented policy reversals and the subjective nature of the claim about transparency, the statement is partially accurate but not entirely factual.

"Roraima, who exported rice, now [after the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol] matters [rice]",half true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the context and implications of the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol on Roraima's rice exports.

Raposa Serra do Sol is an indigenous territory in the state of Roraima, Brazil. The demarcation of this territory has been a contentious issue, with concerns raised about its impact on the local economy, including rice production and export.

The claim suggests that Roraima, which previously exported rice, no longer does so after the demarcation of Raposa Serra do Sol. However, the reality is more nuanced. The demarcation has indeed led to changes in land use and agricultural practices, but it has not necessarily halted all rice exports from Roraima. The extent of the impact varies, and some rice production and export activities may still continue, albeit potentially at a reduced scale.

Given this context, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
Paola Taverna on cuts to the increases for health care has (almost) reason,mostly true,it,"To evaluate the claim ""'Paola Taverna on cuts to the increases for health care has (almost) reason',"" we need more context and specific details about what Paola Taverna has said regarding cuts to increases for healthcare. Without additional information, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim.

However, based on the structure of the statement, it appears to suggest that Paola Taverna has a point or is somewhat justified in her arguments concerning cuts to healthcare funding increases. The use of ""(almost) reason"" implies a nuanced position, acknowledging some validity to her arguments but not fully endorsing them.

Given the lack of specific details, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, the phrasing suggests a partial agreement with her stance.

The truthfulness of this statement would depend on various factors such as the specific circumstances of farmers in the region or country being discussed, economic indicators, government policies, and other relevant data.

However, if we consider that farmers often face significant economic challenges, including low profit margins, high input costs, and market fluctuations, it is plausible that many farmers may feel they are not receiving a fair share of the economic benefits.

"""The [electric] demand expanded 41% between 2003 and 2011, almost 50% more than in the neoliberal phase""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""The [electric] demand expanded 41% between 2003 and 2011, almost 50% more than in the neoliberal phase,"" we need to consider both the accuracy of the percentage increase and the comparison with the neoliberal phase.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Electric Demand Increase from 2003 to 2011:**
   - The claim states that electric demand increased by 41% between 2003 and 2011. This would require data from official sources such as government energy reports or industry analysis.

2. **Comparison with Neoliberal Phase:**
   - The claim also states that this increase was ""almost 50% more than in the neoliberal phase."" This requires defining the ""neoliberal phase"" and comparing the percentage increases in electric demand during both periods.

### Assumptions and Data Requirements:
- **Neoliberal Phase:** Typically, this refers to a period characterized by policies favoring free-market capitalism, often associated with the late 20th century (e.g., 1980s to early 2000s).
- **Data Sources:** Reliable sources such as government energy reports, International Energy Agency (IEA) data, or academic studies on energy consumption trends.

### Verification:
- Without specific data, we cannot definitively confirm the 41% increase or the comparison with the neoliberal phase.
- However, if we assume that the data provided is accurate and comes from a reliable source, we can analyze the claim based on the presented information.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact percentages, the claim appears to be a mix of potentially accurate information (41% increase) and a comparative statement that requires more context. Therefore, the claim is likely accurate but needs further verification for the comparison aspect.

The ""COVVID"" application is not a widely recognized or legitimate application related to COVID-19. Official health organizations and governments typically communicate clearly about any applications they develop for contact tracing or health monitoring.

Livestock farming can indeed have significant environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions (particularly methane and nitrous oxide), deforestation for grazing land, and water pollution from waste runoff. However, the extent of these impacts can vary greatly depending on the type of livestock and the farming practices used.

Here's a breakdown:
- True: Livestock farming contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues.

"""1200 pregnancies in schools, Dakar a bad student"".",false,fr,"To evaluate the claim ""1200 pregnancies in schools, Dakar a bad student,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. The number of pregnancies in schools in Dakar.
2. The context of Dakar being referred to as a ""bad student"" in relation to these pregnancies.

Without specific data or sources to corroborate the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy. However, for the sake of this exercise, I will provide a hypothetical analysis:

- If the number of pregnancies is indeed 1200 and this is considered high compared to other regions or previous years, the claim could be true.
- If the number is exaggerated or the context of Dakar being a ""bad student"" is not supported by data, the claim could be false or mostly false.

Given the lack of specific data, I would lean towards a cautious evaluation.

If he [João Doria] had fulfilled [the promise of not leaving the city] he would not have 60% rejection in the city of São Paulo,half true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two main aspects: João Doria's promise and his rejection rate in the city of São Paulo.

1. **Promise of not leaving the city**: It is well-documented that João Doria, while serving as the mayor of São Paulo, promised not to leave the city to run for higher office. However, he later resigned to run for governor of São Paulo state.

2. **Rejection rate**: According to various polls, João Doria's rejection rate among voters in the city of São Paulo was indeed high, with some polls showing it to be around 60%.

Given these points, the claim that if Doria had fulfilled his promise, he would not have such a high rejection rate is a matter of speculation. While it is true that his rejection rate was high and that he broke his promise, we cannot definitively say that one caused the other. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true but has elements of truth.

"""Italy is the fourth country in the G7 in terms of percentage between public help to development and gross national income (0.30% achieved this year a few years in advance of what is expected)""",true,it,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **G7 Ranking**: The G7 countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The claim states that Italy is the fourth country in the G7 in terms of the percentage of public help to development relative to gross national income (GNI).

2. **Percentage of GNI**: The claim specifies that Italy has achieved a percentage of 0.30% this year.

3. **Achievement Timeline**: The claim suggests that Italy has achieved this percentage a few years ahead of what is expected.

To verify this claim, we would need to check the latest data from reliable sources such as the OECD, the World Bank, or other international organizations that track development aid. However, since I don't have real-time access to the internet to check the latest data, I'll base my evaluation on general knowledge and typical trends.

**General Knowledge and Trends**:
- Italy has historically been among the lower contributors in terms of the percentage of GNI dedicated to development aid within the G7.
- The target for developed countries is often set at 0.7% of GNI for official development assistance (ODA), but many countries fall short of this target.

Given this context, the claim that Italy is fourth in the G7 with 0.30% of GNI dedicated to development aid seems plausible but should be verified with the latest data. The assertion that this was achieved a few years in advance of what is expected adds a layer of complexity that requires specific data to confirm.

Giulia Grillo misses: Italian doctors and nurses are not the least paid,false,it,"To evaluate the claim ""Giulia Grillo misses: Italian doctors and nurses are not the least paid,"" we need to consider the context and the available data.

1. **Context**: Giulia Grillo is a former Italian politician and Minister of Health. Her statements often involve healthcare policy and compensation for medical professionals.

2. **Data and Comparisons**: To determine if Italian doctors and nurses are the least paid, we need to compare their salaries with those in other countries.

3. **Evidence**:
   - According to various sources, including the OECD and Eurostat, Italian healthcare professionals are generally not the lowest paid in Europe.
   - While salaries can vary widely, countries like Bulgaria, Romania, and some Eastern European nations often have lower average salaries for doctors and nurses compared to Italy.

Given this context and evidence, the claim that Italian doctors and nurses are not the least paid appears to be accurate.

"Africa loses approximately 370 billion CFA francs each year because of Aflatoxin, announces the partnership for the fight against aflatoxine.",half true,fr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the credibility of the source and the data presented. The Partnership for Aflatoxin Control in Africa (PACA) is a recognized organization that focuses on mitigating the effects of aflatoxins, which are toxic compounds produced by certain molds that can contaminate food crops.

Aflatoxins pose significant health and economic risks, particularly in Africa, where they can cause liver disease, stunting in children, and other health issues. They also lead to substantial economic losses due to reduced crop yields, lowered market prices, and trade restrictions.

Given the recognized impact of aflatoxins and the work of organizations like PACA, the claim that Africa loses approximately 370 billion CFA francs each year due to aflatoxins is plausible. However, without direct data to verify the exact figure, we can consider it mostly accurate based on the known impacts of aflatoxins.

"""Since Macri governs his policies melled more than three thousand SMEs""",half true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""Since Macri governs his policies melled more than three thousand SMEs,"" we need to consider the context and available data regarding the impact of Mauricio Macri's policies on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Argentina.

Mauricio Macri served as the President of Argentina from 2015 to 2019. During his tenure, Argentina faced significant economic challenges, including high inflation, currency devaluation, and a recession. These factors undoubtedly affected SMEs, which are often more vulnerable to economic downturns.

However, the claim that his policies specifically ""melled"" (likely a typo for ""melted,"" implying caused the closure of) more than three thousand SMEs requires specific data to verify. While it is known that many SMEs struggled during Macri's presidency, attributing the closure of a specific number of SMEs directly to his policies without concrete data is speculative.

Given the lack of precise data in the claim and the general knowledge of the economic challenges during Macri's term, the statement is partially accurate but lacks the specificity needed for full verification.

"""Scioli paid for official advertising $ 1.5 billion [in 2015]""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""Scioli paid for official advertising $1.5 billion [in 2015],"" we need to consider the context and the available data.

1. **Context of the Claim**: Daniel Scioli was a candidate in the 2015 Argentine presidential election. The claim suggests that his campaign spent $1.5 billion on official advertising.

2. **Currency Clarification**: The claim does not specify the currency. It is crucial to determine whether the amount is in Argentine pesos or US dollars, as this significantly affects the evaluation.

3. **Comparison with Known Data**:
   - According to various sources, the total spending on political advertising in Argentina for the 2015 election was significantly lower than $1.5 billion USD.
   - In Argentine pesos, the spending might be more reasonable, but $1.5 billion ARS would still be a very high figure, especially considering the exchange rate at the time.

4. **Official Records**: Checking official campaign finance records and reports from electoral oversight bodies would provide the most accurate information.

Given the lack of specificity in the claim and the general understanding of campaign spending in Argentina, it is highly unlikely that Scioli's campaign spent $1.5 billion USD on advertising. Even in Argentine pesos, this figure would be extraordinarily high.

However, without specific data sources and context, I can provide an analysis based on general economic trends and indicators.

1. **Economic Context**: Argentina has faced significant economic challenges, including high inflation, which can impact wage levels.
2. **Wage Distribution**: While specific data on the proportion of workers earning a certain amount is not provided, it's known that a significant portion of workers in many countries earn wages near or at the minimum wage.
3. **Minimum Wage**: The minimum wage in Argentina can be a benchmark, but the claim specifies a dollar amount, which complicates direct comparison due to currency fluctuations.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact percentage, the claim could be considered plausible but not definitively accurate without further evidence. Therefore, the claim is likely an overgeneralization or exaggeration based on broad economic trends.

2. **Burkina Faso**: Check if the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 32%.
3. **Côte d'Ivoire**: Check if the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 32%.

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to current economic data. However, I can provide a general approach to verify this information:

- Consult economic databases such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), or national statistical agencies.
- Look for recent reports or publications that provide the debt-to-GDP ratios for these countries.

Given the lack of real-time data access, I'll provide a hypothetical evaluation based on typical verification methods:

- If recent data from reliable sources confirms that Senegal's debt-to-GDP ratio is around 65%, Burkina Faso's around 32%, and Côte d'Ivoire's around 32%, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the data shows significant discrepancies but the general trend is correct, it might be 'Mostly True'.
- If the data is mixed, with some accurate and some inaccurate figures, it would be 'Half True'.
- If the data shows significant discrepancies and the general trend is incorrect, it would be 'Mostly False'.

Without specific evidence or context, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to specific legislative actions or discussions that occurred during Cunha's term, we can consider whether those matters were indeed addressed comprehensively.

If there is clear documentation showing that the district vote and mixed district vote were debated, voted on, or otherwise resolved during Cunha's presidency, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True.' If the matters were only partially addressed or if significant aspects remained unresolved, the claim might be 'Half True.'

Given these timelines, the claim that Salvini has been a politician since Di Maio was in first grade is mostly accurate, as Salvini's political career began around the same time Di Maio would have been in first grade.

"""After 10 years of parity we were in a [minimum teacher] salary that was below the minimum, vital and mobile""",false,es,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the context and verify the facts behind the statement. The claim suggests that after 10 years of parity, the teacher salary fell below the minimum, vital, and mobile wage.

1. **Parity**: This likely refers to a period where teacher salaries were maintained at a certain level or standard relative to other professions or standards.
2. **Minimum, Vital, and Mobile Wage**: This term generally refers to a wage level that is considered the minimum necessary for a worker to meet basic needs.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim's accuracy. However, if we assume the claim is based on reliable data showing a decline in teacher salaries relative to a defined minimum wage standard over a 10-year period, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the general plausibility of economic fluctuations and potential discrepancies in wage adjustments, the claim could be partially true but requires verification of specific data points.

[Lula] was the president who created the most universities,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim that ""[Lula] was the president who created the most universities,"" we need to look at the historical data on the creation of universities in Brazil during different presidential terms.

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula, served as the President of Brazil from 2003 to 2011. During his administration, there was a significant expansion of higher education institutions, including the creation of new federal universities and the expansion of existing ones. This period saw substantial investments in education, aiming to increase access to higher education for a broader segment of the population.

When comparing Lula's term with those of other presidents, it is generally recognized that his administration did indeed create a large number of universities. However, the specific claim that he created ""the most"" would need to be verified against other presidential terms to ensure accuracy.

Given the significant expansion of higher education institutions during Lula's presidency, the claim is likely to be substantially true, although it might not be absolutely true in a strictly quantitative sense without further detailed comparison.

[Brazil received] less than 100 thousand [Venezuelans].Colombia received 700 thousand,false,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the given numbers with current data on Venezuelan migration to Brazil and Colombia.

As of recent data:
- Brazil has received more than 250,000 Venezuelan migrants and refugees.
- Colombia has received over 1.7 million Venezuelan migrants and refugees.

Comparing these figures with the claim:
- The claim states Brazil received less than 100,000 Venezuelans, which is incorrect since the actual number is more than 250,000.
- The claim states Colombia received 700,000 Venezuelans, which is also incorrect since the actual number is over 1.7 million.

Given these discrepancies, the claim is significantly inaccurate.

Thefts in apartment & immigration: so Berlusconi thinks it,half true,it,"To evaluate the claim ""Thefts in apartment & immigration: so Berlusconi thinks it,"" we need more context and specific details. Without additional information about what Berlusconi specifically said or the broader context in which he made any statements, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim.

However, based on the limited information provided, the claim seems to suggest a correlation between apartment thefts and immigration, presumably attributing blame for thefts to immigrants. This is a common political rhetoric but often lacks empirical evidence.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context, the claim appears to be a generalization that may not be fully supported by facts. Therefore, without further information, the claim can be considered:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
The Tav is part of a much wider project that connects Palermo to Kiev,mostly true,it,"To assess the claim, we need to understand what ""The Tav"" refers to and the context of the project connecting Palermo to Kiev.

""The Tav"" likely refers to the Turin-Lyon high-speed railway, which is part of a broader European transportation network initiative. The project aims to enhance connectivity across Europe, including potential linkages between Italy and Eastern Europe.

While the Turin-Lyon high-speed railway is indeed part of a wider European project, it is not specifically designed to connect Palermo directly to Kiev. Instead, it is part of a broader effort to improve transportation infrastructure across Europe, which could indirectly facilitate travel between these cities.

Given this context, the claim is somewhat exaggerated but contains elements of truth.

Today we have no problems with water supply,half true,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""Today we have no problems with water supply,"" we need more context. If the claim is made in a region where there are known water shortages, water quality issues, or infrastructure problems, then it would be inaccurate. However, if it is made in a region where water supply is indeed stable and of good quality, then it could be true.

Without specific context, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, given the general nature of the statement and the fact that water supply issues can vary greatly by location and time, it is likely that there are some problems with water supply somewhere.

While a 7% deficit is significant, it is not unprecedented. For example, during World War II, the deficit reached as high as 30% of GDP.

Without knowing the specific country being referred to, it is impossible to evaluate the statement. However, in a general sense, there are countries that are considered highly restrictive in terms of freedoms, access to information, and interaction with the outside world. Examples include North Korea and Eritrea, which are often cited as some of the most closed countries.

If the statement is made in reference to one of these countries, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If it is made in reference to a country that is not generally considered closed, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

"When I was secretary here in São Paulo, I implemented the new Work Program, which generated more than 2,000 jobs for the homeless",true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Verifiability**: Can the implementation of the new Work Program and the number of jobs generated be confirmed through official records, reports, or other reliable sources?
2. **Specificity**: The claim specifies ""more than 2,000 jobs for the homeless."" This can be checked against actual data to see if it holds true.
3. **Context**: The context of the implementation and its impact on the homeless population in São Paulo is crucial.

Without specific data or references to verify the claim, we can only make an educated guess based on typical practices and the likelihood of such a program's success.

Given that the claim is specific about the number of jobs created and the target population (homeless), it is possible to check this against available data. However, without that data, we cannot definitively say it is 'True' or 'False.'

**Final Answer: Half True**

However, without specific data on the prices of Cashell in these countries, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. Generally, prices can vary based on various factors such as supply, demand, and local economic conditions.

Without concrete data, we can only make an educated guess based on general economic trends. If Côte d'Ivoire has a more robust economy or better access to certain goods, it might be plausible that prices are lower there compared to Burkina Faso. However, this is speculative without actual price data.

Given the lack of specific information, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

"""All these funds [of the Recovery Fund] are much more conditioned than the MES"" (min. O: 56)",true,it,"The claim that ""All these funds [of the Recovery Fund] are much more conditioned than the MES"" can be evaluated based on the structure and conditions of the Recovery Fund compared to the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).

The Recovery Fund, also known as Next Generation EU (NGEU), indeed has more stringent conditions attached to its funding. Countries receiving funds from the Recovery Fund must submit detailed national recovery plans outlining specific reforms and investments, which are subject to approval by the European Commission and the Council. These plans must align with European Union priorities such as green transition and digital transformation.

In contrast, the ESM provides financial assistance to eurozone countries in need, primarily through loans, with conditions that are generally focused on fiscal adjustment and structural reforms but are less detailed and specific compared to the Recovery Fund.

Therefore, the claim that the funds from the Recovery Fund are much more conditioned than the MES is accurate.

[The participation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at my inauguration ceremony] was the first visit of a head of Israeli government to my country,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider historical records of Israeli prime minister visits to other countries. Without specific details about which country's inauguration ceremony is being referred to, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the context is a specific country's inauguration, we can assess the general plausibility.

Israeli prime ministers have visited various countries over the years, but the specific claim of a prime minister attending an inauguration ceremony for the first time is unusual and would likely be noted in historical records or news reports.

Given the lack of specific context, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, for the sake of providing an answer based on general knowledge, it is unlikely that such a significant event would not be well-documented.

The Global Forest Watch, which provides data on forest loss, indicates that Senegal has been losing forest cover at a substantial rate. While the exact figure can vary depending on the source and the specific time period, the claim of 40,000 hectares per year is consistent with the trends observed in recent years.

Given this information, the claim appears to be generally accurate, reflecting the ongoing issue of deforestation in Senegal.

1. **Historical Data for 1983**: The claim states that in 1983, the provinces had 49% of national resources. This would require historical economic data to verify.

2. **Current Data**: The claim states that today, the provinces have 26% of national resources. This would require current economic data to verify.

3. **Definition of ""National Resources""**: The term ""national resources"" can be interpreted in various ways, such as financial resources, natural resources, or economic output. Clarification on what is meant by ""national resources"" is necessary for accurate evaluation.

4. **Sources and Methodology**: The credibility of the claim depends on the sources and methodology used to gather and interpret the data.

Without specific data and context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general nature of such claims and the need for verification through reliable sources, a cautious approach would be to consider it as 'Half True' until further evidence is provided.

When Renzi and (a part of the) Lega were against the Tav,mostly true,it,"The claim that Matteo Renzi and a part of the Lega were against the TAV (Treno Alta Velocità) is complex and requires contextual understanding.

Matteo Renzi, who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 2014 to 2016, has generally been in favor of the TAV project, viewing it as a crucial infrastructure development for Italy. However, during his time in government, there were periods of opposition and debate within his own party, the Democratic Party (PD), regarding the TAV project.

The Lega, particularly under the leadership of Matteo Salvini, has had varying stances on the TAV project. While some factions within the Lega have opposed the project, others have supported it, often depending on regional interests and political alliances.

Given this context, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

If we assume that the claim is based on some form of analysis or report that contradicts Boschi's statements, then it might be considered 'Mostly True' if there is substantial evidence to back it up, or 'Half True' if the evidence is mixed. If the claim lacks any substantial evidence or is based on misinformation, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Nigeria is the country with the most not educated girls in the world.,mostly true,fr,"The claim that ""Nigeria is the country with the most not educated girls in the world"" is a complex issue that requires some nuance. According to various reports, including those from UNESCO and UNICEF, Nigeria does have one of the highest numbers of out-of-school girls in the world. However, it is important to consider the context and compare it with other countries that may also have significant numbers of girls who are not receiving an education.

As of recent data, Nigeria does indeed have a very large number of out-of-school girls, primarily due to factors such as poverty, conflict, and cultural practices. However, without specific and direct comparisons with other countries in terms of absolute numbers, it is challenging to definitively state that Nigeria has the most.

Given this context, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but requires additional context for full verification. Therefore, the claim is:

Without the exact statements or a detailed analysis of the economic ties between Italy and Mozambique, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, generally speaking, Italy and Mozambique do have economic relations, which include trade, investment, and development cooperation. Italy is one of Mozambique's trade partners, and there are Italian companies operating in various sectors in Mozambique. Additionally, Italy provides development aid to Mozambique through various channels.

Given this background, if Conte's statements align with the known economic ties and cooperative efforts between the two countries, the claim could be considered accurate. However, without specific details, we can only make a general assessment.

Historical data suggests that Senegal's population has been growing at a rate that could lead to it doubling in roughly 20 to 30 years, depending on the specific time period examined.

2. **Voting Record**: Salvini's voting record in the European Parliament (assuming he is or was a member) should be reviewed to see if he consistently voted against measures to protect the environment.

Without specific data on Salvini's statements and voting record, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if Salvini has publicly acknowledged environmental emergencies but has a record of voting against environmental protection measures, the claim would be mostly true. If his voting record is mixed, it would be half true.

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look for data from Senegal's Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), or international financial institutions like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

2. **Currency Conversion**: Ensure that 6,000 billion FCFA (CFA Francs) aligns with the most recent public debt figures. Note that 1 billion FCFA is approximately 1.524 million USD as of recent exchange rates.

3. **Comparison with Previous Data**: Compare the claimed figure with historical data to see if there has been a significant change.

If the most recent data from these sources confirms that Senegal's public debt is around 6,000 billion FCFA, then the claim is likely true. If the data shows a different figure, the claim's accuracy would need to be reassessed accordingly.

While he has sometimes advocated for more fiscal flexibility, he has also expressed support for some aspects of the Maastricht criteria, which aim to maintain budget deficits and public debt within certain limits.

"""[Between 2003 and 2011] we create 300 thousand jobs""",false,es,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at employment data for the specified period, 2003 to 2011. However, without specific data or context, such as the location (e.g., country, state, city) or the source of the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

Generally, to verify such a claim:
1. Check official employment statistics from reliable sources like government labor departments or economic reports.
2. Compare the total number of jobs created during the period with the claimed figure of 300,000 jobs.

Since I don't have access to real-time data or specific context, I can't provide a precise evaluation. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have checked the data and found the following:

- If the actual number of jobs created is very close to 300,000 (e.g., between 270,000 and 330,000), the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- If the number is significantly lower or higher (e.g., between 150,000 and 270,000 or between 330,000 and 450,000), the claim would be 'Half True'.

Six hundred women have lost their lives during childbirth in Senegal since #COVVI19SN,half true,fr,"To evaluate the claim that ""Six hundred women have lost their lives during childbirth in Senegal since #COVVI19SN,"" we need to consider several factors, including the source of the data, the timeframe, and the context of maternal mortality rates in Senegal.

However, without specific data or a reliable source to verify the exact number of maternal deaths since the COVID-19 pandemic, it is challenging to definitively say whether this claim is accurate. Maternal mortality rates can vary, and the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare systems can also influence these rates.

Given the lack of specific data to support or refute the claim, it is best to classify it as:

"""We increase 100% the amounts we send to school canteens""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim ""We increase 100% the amounts we send to school canteens,"" we need to consider the context and the typical usage of such a statement. Doubling the amounts sent to school canteens would indeed be a 100% increase. However, without specific data or context, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim definitively.

Given the lack of context or supporting data, the claim could be considered ambiguous but not inherently false if interpreted literally. Therefore, a reasonable assessment would be:

"The officials of this party invested on rival lists will lose their mandate as deputies, if they are elected on the evening of July 31, 2017, in accordance with the law.",false,fr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the law it refers to. The claim states that officials of a political party who run on rival lists will lose their mandate as deputies if they are elected on July 31, 2017, in accordance with the law.

Without specific knowledge of the law in question, we can analyze the general plausibility of such a scenario. In many democratic systems, party officials who switch allegiances or run on rival lists may indeed face consequences, such as losing their mandate or position within their original party. However, the specifics can vary greatly depending on the jurisdiction and the relevant laws.

Given the lack of specific details about the law and the context, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is entirely true or false. It is plausible that such a law could exist, but without more information, we cannot confirm its accuracy.

While Neuquén is often recognized for its strong economic performance, particularly due to its significant oil and gas industry, asserting that it has the ""best"" economic and social indicators across the board is a strong claim that requires comprehensive data to support.

Without specific data for comparison, it's challenging to definitively say that Neuquén outperforms every other province in Argentina in all economic and social indicators. Therefore, while Neuquén may have strong economic indicators, the claim that it has the ""best"" in every aspect might be an overstatement.

"""From the crisis until today the basic salary of the industrial sector rose 10 times, [while] inflation (...) rose six times""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the given information about the rise in basic salary and inflation. The claim states that the basic salary of the industrial sector rose 10 times, while inflation rose six times.

If the basic salary increased 10 times and inflation increased 6 times, it implies that the purchasing power of the salary has increased. This is because the salary increase outpaced the inflation rate.

However, without specific numerical data or context (such as the time period referred to as ""from the crisis until today""), it is challenging to definitively verify the claim's accuracy. Generally, if the salary increase is significantly higher than the inflation rate, the claim could be considered mostly true, assuming the provided figures are accurate.

Given the information provided, the claim appears to be plausible but lacks the specific data needed for full verification. Therefore, the most reasonable assessment would be:

"More education does not mean, in Brazil, more productivity",true,pt,"The relationship between education and productivity can be complex and varies by country. In Brazil, while education is generally seen as beneficial for productivity, there are several factors that might make the statement ""More education does not mean, in Brazil, more productivity"" hold some truth. These factors include the quality of education, the relevance of the curriculum to the job market, and the larger economic and institutional context.

Studies have shown that while Brazil has made strides in increasing access to education, the quality of education remains a significant issue. Additionally, the mismatch between the skills taught in educational institutions and the demands of the labor market can hinder productivity gains.

Given these nuances, the statement is not entirely false but also not entirely true. It reflects some of the challenges in Brazil's education system and its impact on productivity.

According to data from UNICEF, the prevalence of child marriage in Senegal is indeed a significant issue. However, the most recent data indicates that the percentage of women aged 20-24 who were married before the age of 18 is approximately 33%. While this figure is close to 35%, it is slightly lower.

Given this information, the claim that ""35% of Senegalese are married before reaching the age of 18"" is not entirely accurate but is close to the actual reported figures. Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly true.

The ""rule of three"" is a basic algebraic concept that involves solving problems where three values are related in a way that one can be found if the other two are known. It is typically covered in middle school mathematics.

While there is no specific data provided in the claim, we can look at general trends in mathematical proficiency among 15-year-olds. According to various educational assessments, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a significant portion of 15-year-olds do struggle with basic mathematical concepts. However, claiming that 70% do not know the rule of three might be an overestimation without specific data to back it up.

Given the lack of specific data and the general trends observed in educational assessments, the claim might be somewhat true but likely exaggerated.

Is it rare for a mayor to have his mandate as a federal deputy revoked?,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim 'Is it rare for a mayor to have his mandate as a federal deputy revoked?', we need to consider the frequency of such occurrences. In many political systems, the revocation of a mandate, particularly for high-level positions like a federal deputy, is indeed uncommon. This is because the process typically involves significant legal and political hurdles, including investigations, hearings, and votes.

Given the rarity of such events, the claim that it is rare for a mayor to have his mandate as a federal deputy revoked is accurate.

"""Young women, today, double in terms of unemployment to the general unemployment of the country""",true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""Young women, today, double in terms of unemployment to the general unemployment of the country,"" we need to examine the most recent and reliable data on unemployment rates for young women compared to the general unemployment rate.

As of the latest available data, the unemployment rate for young women (typically defined as those aged 16-24) is often higher than the general unemployment rate. However, whether it is exactly double can vary depending on the specific country and time period.

In many countries, young women do face higher unemployment rates than the general population, but it is not always exactly double. The discrepancy can be significant, but the claim that it is precisely double requires specific data to support it.

Given this context, the claim is likely exaggerated but has some basis in truth. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

"If we approve (PEC) 241, we do not need to think of tribute, because, we agree, the tax burden has reached its limit",half true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the context and implications of PEC 241. PEC 241, also known as the ""PEC do Teto dos Gastos"" in Brazil, is a proposed constitutional amendment that aims to limit government spending growth to the rate of inflation for the next 20 years.

The claim suggests that if PEC 241 is approved, there would be no need to think about taxes because the tax burden has reached its limit. However, the approval of PEC 241 primarily addresses government spending and does not directly eliminate the need for taxes or reduce the existing tax burden. While it could indirectly influence fiscal policy and potentially lead to discussions about tax reform, it does not inherently mean that taxes would no longer be a concern.

Given this analysis, the claim is misleading because it oversimplifies the relationship between government spending limits and tax policy.

"«We found an Italy with 10 million poor.With the highest unemployment rate in Europe "".",half true,it,"To evaluate the claim ""We found an Italy with 10 million poor. With the highest unemployment rate in Europe,"" we need to verify two key points: the number of poor people in Italy and Italy's unemployment rate compared to other European countries.

1. **Number of poor people in Italy**: According to various sources, including Eurostat and national statistics, the number of people living in poverty in Italy is indeed significant. However, the exact figure can vary depending on the definition of poverty used. As of recent data, the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion in Italy is around 10 million, which aligns with the claim.

2. **Unemployment rate in Italy**: Italy has had one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe, particularly among youth. However, whether it is the highest can vary based on the specific time period and comparison with other countries like Greece, Spain, and others that have also had high unemployment rates.

Given these points, the claim is mostly accurate regarding the number of poor people but may not be entirely accurate about having the highest unemployment rate at all times. Therefore, the claim is mostly true but not entirely precise.

"""In the city, half of the workers are from the province""",true,es,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the statement ""half of the workers are from the province."" Without additional context or data, we cannot definitively say whether this claim is accurate. However, we can assess the claim based on its face value.

- If exactly 50% of the workers in the city are from the province, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the percentage is close to 50%, but not exactly, it could be 'Mostly True'.
- If the percentage is around 50%, but there is significant uncertainty or variability, it could be 'Half True'.
- If the percentage is significantly different from 50%, but still somewhat close, it could be 'Mostly False'.
- If the percentage is far from 50%, the claim would be 'False'.

Without specific data, we cannot determine the exact truth value. However, based on the statement alone, assuming a neutral stance without additional information, the claim could be considered 'Half True' as it makes a specific assertion about a 50% distribution.

Affinity and divergences between Farage and Grillo in Europe,true,it,"The claim suggests that there are both affinities and divergences between Nigel Farage and Beppe Grillo in the context of European politics. Both Farage and Grillo are known for their Eurosceptic views and have led populist movements—Farage with UKIP and later the Brexit Party in the UK, and Grillo with the Five Star Movement in Italy. However, there are also significant differences in their political stances, backgrounds, and the specific policies they advocate for.

**Affinities:**
1. **Euroscepticism:** Both Farage and Grillo have been critical of the European Union and have advocated for reforms or withdrawal from certain EU policies.
2. **Populist Appeal:** Both leaders have leveraged populist sentiment, appealing to voters who feel disenfranchised by traditional political parties.

**Divergences:**
1. **Political Background:** Farage has a long history in politics, having been a member of the European Parliament, while Grillo comes from an entertainment background and has never held elected office.
2. **Policies and Ideologies:** While both are Eurosceptic, their policy positions differ on various issues. For instance, Grillo's Five Star Movement has a strong focus on direct democracy and environmentalism, which are not central to Farage's political agenda.
3. **Approach to Politics:** Farage has been more focused on national sovereignty and immigration, while Grillo has emphasized anti-corruption and digital democracy.

Given these points, the claim that there are both affinities and divergences between Farage and Grillo is accurate. They share some commonalities in their Eurosceptic views and populist appeal, but they also have significant differences in their political backgrounds, specific policies, and approaches to politics.

1. **Population in Poverty**: The claim states that there are 2.7 million people living in poverty in São Paulo. This number needs to be verified against official statistics.

2. **Emergency Aid Amount**: The claim suggests that emergency aid was halved from $600 to $300. This information should be cross-checked with government policies or official announcements.

3. **Impact of Reduction**: The claim implies that a significant number of people are affected by this reduction. This requires data on the actual distribution and impact of the emergency aid.

Without access to current official statistics and government policies, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on typical practices for fact-checking, if the numbers align with official data and the reduction in aid is accurate, the claim could be considered mostly true. If there are significant discrepancies or omissions, it could be considered half true or mostly false.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the claim aligns closely with official data but might have some minor inaccuracies or omissions.

1. **Identify the Claim Components:**
   - ""Places earned"" suggests an increase in employment.
   - ""Lost places"" suggests a decrease in employment.
   - ""Salvini's numbers"" refers to data or statements attributed to Matteo Salvini.
   - ""US employment"" specifies the context as the United States job market.

2. **Verify the Data:**
   - Check official sources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for recent employment data.
   - Look for statements or data presented by Matteo Salvini regarding U.S. employment.
   - Compare Salvini's numbers with official statistics to determine accuracy.

3. **Analysis:**
   - If Salvini's numbers align closely with official data, the claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True.'
   - If there are significant discrepancies but some elements are correct, it might be 'Half True.'
   - If the numbers are largely inaccurate or misleading, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Given the hypothetical nature of this task and without specific numbers or context provided by Salvini, we can't definitively verify the claim. However, based on general guidelines for evaluating such claims:

- **True:** If Salvini's numbers match official data closely.
- **Mostly True:** If there are minor discrepancies but the overall trend is correct.
- **Half True:** If some parts are correct but others are misleading or incorrect.
- **Mostly False:** If significant parts of the data are incorrect.
- **False:** If the data presented is entirely inaccurate.

Without specific data on the country's economic growth rates for the years in question, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, we can approach this logically:

1. **Growth Rate of 6.6% in 2016**: This can be verified through official economic reports or databases such as the World Bank or IMF.

2. **Consecutive Years of Over 6% Growth**: This requires historical economic data to confirm that there was no other period since 1980 where the country achieved over 6% growth for three consecutive years.

1. **Senegal's System**: Senegal does have a system in place through the Institut de Prévoyance Retraite du Sénégal (IPRES) that provides medical care for retirees. The cost mentioned (3 billion CFA francs annually) indicates a significant investment in this area.

2. **Comparison with Other Countries**: To verify the claim that Senegal is the only country in West Africa with such provisions, we would need to examine the retirement and healthcare systems of other West African nations. Countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Côte d'Ivoire, among others, have various levels of social security and healthcare provisions for retirees, though the extent and coverage may vary.

3. **Evidence and Context**: The claim made by Mamadou Racine Sy, PCA of IPRES, is specific to Senegal's context and may not comprehensively reflect the retirement and healthcare landscape across all West African countries. Without detailed comparative data, it is challenging to assert that Senegal is the only country with such provisions.

"«[For the Coronavirus emergency] do not abandon your animals.There is no valid reason """,true,it,"The statement ""Do not abandon your animals. There is no valid reason"" in the context of the Coronavirus emergency is generally accurate, as there is no evidence that pets play a significant role in spreading the virus to humans, and abandoning them is not recommended. However, it simplifies a complex issue, as there can be unique circumstances where someone might feel they need to rehome or temporarily place their pet due to personal health or financial constraints caused by the pandemic. Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate but not entirely comprehensive.

Without access to real-time data or context, it's challenging to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, I can provide a general framework for how such a claim could be assessed:

1. **True**: If data shows significant discrepancies between the spread of the virus in Liguria and the rest of the country, supporting the claim that Liguria's situation is not in line with the national trend.
2. **Mostly True**: If the data indicates some discrepancies but not to the extent that completely invalidates Toti's statement.
3. **Half True**: If the data is mixed or inconclusive, showing both similarities and differences in the spread of the virus.
4. **Mostly False**: If the data suggests minor discrepancies but largely aligns Liguria's situation with the national trend.
5. **False**: If the data shows that the spread of the virus in Liguria is very similar to the rest of the country, contradicting the claim.

Given the lack of specific data, a conservative approach would be to assume that without clear evidence, the claim cannot be definitively proven or disproven. Therefore, a middle ground assessment would be:

"""They have not reached 40% of what they had promised""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim ""They have not reached 40% of what they had promised,"" we would need specific data and context regarding the promises made and the extent to which they have been fulfilled. Without such information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have evaluated the data and determined the following:

- If the promises were only partially fulfilled, but more than 40% has been achieved, the claim would be 'Mostly False'.
- If less than 40% of the promises were fulfilled, but it's close to 40%, the claim might be 'Half True'.
- If significantly less than 40% was achieved, the claim would be 'True'.

Given the lack of specific data, I'll provide a hypothetical response based on a common scenario where significantly less than 40% was achieved:

And all students [of the middle -time high -time schools in Ceará] have a government -paid internship,mostly true,pt,"To evaluate the claim that ""all students [of the middle -time high -time schools in Ceará] have a government-paid internship,"" we need to consider the likelihood and scope of such a program.

Government-paid internships for all students in middle and high schools are not typical in most education systems globally. While some countries or regions may offer internship programs, it is rare for them to be universally available to all students. Usually, such programs are selective or targeted to specific groups or areas of study.

Given this context, the claim that every single student in middle and high schools in Ceará has a government-paid internship is highly unlikely. Without specific evidence to support this claim, it is reasonable to conclude that it is not true for all students.

"The PMDB, its leaders and its bench have never acted as an active pole in this process (impeachment)",false,pt,"To evaluate the claim that 'The PMDB, its leaders and its bench have never acted as an active pole in this process (impeachment),' we need to consider the role of the PMDB (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party) in the impeachment process.

The PMDB, particularly during the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016, played a significant role. Several key leaders of the PMDB, including then-Vice President Michel Temer, were actively involved in the impeachment process. Temer himself became the interim president during Rousseff's suspension and later assumed the presidency after her removal from office.

Given this context, the claim that the PMDB, its leaders, and its bench have never acted as an active pole in the impeachment process is inaccurate. The party and its prominent members were indeed active participants in the process.

"""Matteo Salvini (...) in May he exceeded anyone and collected a percentage of television apparitions equal almost double those of President Conte""",false,it,"To evaluate the claim that Matteo Salvini in May exceeded anyone and collected a percentage of television appearances almost double those of President Conte, we would need specific data on the number of television appearances of both individuals during the specified period. Without this data, it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on reliable sources and accurate data, we can proceed with the following reasoning:

1. **True**: The claim is entirely accurate, and Matteo Salvini indeed had almost double the television appearances compared to President Conte in May.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim is largely accurate, but there might be some minor discrepancies or nuances not fully accounted for.
3. **Half True**: The claim has elements of truth but also significant inaccuracies or omissions.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim is largely inaccurate, with only minor elements of truth.
5. **False**: The claim is entirely inaccurate and does not reflect the actual situation.

Given the wording of the claim, if it is supported by reliable data, it suggests a significant disparity in television appearances. Therefore, without specific data to contradict it, the claim could be considered mostly true, allowing for minor discrepancies.

26% of men think women ask to be raped,mostly true,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""26% of men think women ask to be raped,"" we need to examine the source and context of this statistic. Without a specific source or context, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim. However, such a statement is highly controversial and would require robust evidence from a reputable study or survey.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided and the sensitive nature of the claim, it is reasonable to be skeptical. Claims about public opinion on such serious issues should be supported by credible research.

"""For the first time in history, in 2017 the percentage of convicted surpassed that of defendants""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim ""For the first time in history, in 2017 the percentage of convicted surpassed that of defendants,"" we need to consider the context and the statistical data available for criminal justice systems.

The claim seems to suggest that the percentage of people convicted of crimes was higher than the percentage of people accused or charged with crimes in 2017. This would be a significant and unusual occurrence, as typically, the number of defendants (those accused of crimes) should be higher than the number of convictions (those found guilty).

Without specific data to verify this claim, it is challenging to determine its accuracy. However, based on general understanding and historical data trends in criminal justice systems, such a scenario is highly unlikely. It would imply that more people were convicted than were initially charged, which is statistically improbable.

Given the lack of supporting evidence and the implausibility of the scenario described, the claim is likely inaccurate.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, I'll assume we are evaluating this claim based on general principles of fact-checking.

If the claim is supported by reliable data showing a 30% decrease in homicides over a specified period, it would be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the data indicates a decrease but not exactly 30%, it might be considered 'Half True'. If the data shows a much smaller decrease or no decrease at all, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, the claim cannot be accurately validated or refuted. Therefore, without additional information, the best we can do is assume it might be partially true but needs verification.

"""Argentina had [in 2012] the most important foreign investment of the entire decade""",mostly true,es,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Argentina had [in 2012] the most important foreign investment of the entire decade,"" we need to consider the context and available data.

Without specific data to verify the claim, we can analyze it based on general economic trends and known information. The ""most important"" foreign investment could refer to either the largest single investment or the highest overall foreign direct investment (FDI) in a given year.

If we consider FDI data, Argentina has historically received significant investments, but whether 2012 was the peak year for the decade would require specific data comparison with other years in the decade.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or deny the claim, a reasonable assessment would be that it might be an exaggeration without concrete evidence. Therefore, the claim is likely not entirely accurate but could contain some truth.

1. Whether the investment grew 11% last year.
2. Whether this growth was the greatest increase in six years.

Without specific data, we can't verify the exact percentage growth or compare it to previous years. However, the claim makes a specific assertion that can be checked against available records if they exist.

Given the information provided in the claim itself, it suggests a specific and verifiable event (11% growth) that is claimed to be the highest in a specific period (six years). If both points are accurate based on the data, the claim would be true. If only one part is accurate, it might be considered mostly true or half true. If neither part is accurate, it would be false.

According to data from the World Health Organization and other international bodies, Africa has indeed seen significant improvements in life expectancy over the past two decades. This improvement can be attributed to various factors, including advances in healthcare, better access to medical treatments, and improvements in living standards.

While other regions have also seen increases in life expectancy, the gains in Africa have been particularly notable, largely due to starting from a lower baseline. However, it's important to note that the rate of increase can vary and may not be uniform across all African countries.

1. **Germany as the ""owner"" of the EU**: This is a misleading and inaccurate statement. Germany is a member state of the European Union, but it does not ""own"" the EU. The EU is a political and economic union of 27 member states, and decisions are made through a complex system of institutions that represent all member states.

2. **Aid to Italian and German companies**: The figures provided are not substantiated by reliable sources. The EU provides various forms of aid and financial support to different countries, but the specific figures of €25 billion for Italian companies and €550 billion for German companies are not verified.

Given the lack of evidence for the specific aid amounts and the inaccurate claim about Germany ""owning"" the EU, the claim is largely false.

"""Argentina is the third world supplier of cocaine""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""Argentina is the third world supplier of cocaine,"" it's important to consider the most recent and reliable data on global cocaine production and trafficking.

According to various reports from international agencies such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the primary suppliers of cocaine are Colombia and Peru. These countries are consistently identified as the top producers of cocaine, with Colombia being the largest supplier globally.

Argentina is known to be a transit country for cocaine, meaning that it plays a role in the trafficking of cocaine from producer countries to consumer markets. However, it is not typically listed as one of the top three producers or suppliers. The claim that Argentina is the third world supplier of cocaine is therefore inaccurate.

IRAP is a regional tax levied on businesses and self-employed individuals, and it contributes to the funding of regional healthcare systems in Italy. However, IRAP is just one of several sources of funding for healthcare, which also includes national taxes, social security contributions, and other regional taxes.

According to available data, IRAP typically contributes a significant portion to regional healthcare budgets, but it does not account for one-third of the total healthcare expenditure. The actual proportion varies, but it is generally less than one-third.

Given this information, the claim that ""We pay a third of health expenditure with IRAP"" is an overstatement.

Without access to specific data or reports, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, I can outline the steps needed to verify this claim:

1. **Check Government Reports**: Look for official government reports on job creation during the specified period. The Ministry of Labor or economic reports from the government of Senegal could provide this information.

2. **International Organizations**: Review reports from organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, or International Labour Organization (ILO) that may have data on job creation in Senegal.

3. **News Articles and Economic Analyses**: Search for news articles or economic analyses from reputable sources that discuss job creation in Senegal during this period.

4. **Cross-Verify with Experts**: Consult with economists or experts familiar with Senegal's economic data to verify the claim.

If the data from these sources aligns with the claim made by Minister Mansour Sy, then the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the data shows significant discrepancies, the claim might be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

1. ""In Italy one in five young people between 15 and 24 years old have no job or study.""
2. ""15% of those who are between 25 and 39 years old have an atypical work at risk of precariousness.""

### Analysis:

1. **One in Five Young People Between 15 and 24 Years Old Have No Job or Study:**
   - This refers to the NEET rate (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). According to recent data from Eurostat and other reputable sources, the NEET rate in Italy for the 15-24 age group has been around 20%, which aligns with the claim of one in five.

2. **15% of Those Between 25 and 39 Years Old Have Atypical Work at Risk of Precariousness:**
   - Atypical work can include part-time, temporary, or other forms of non-standard employment. Data from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and other sources indicate that a significant portion of the workforce in this age group is indeed in precarious or atypical employment situations, with estimates often around 15%.

Argentina, like many countries, has experienced fluctuations in its economy and employment levels over the years. While there may have been periods of economic downturn or stagnation, it is unlikely that there has been absolutely no private employment created since 2007.

Private sector jobs are a crucial part of any economy, and even during economic crises, some new jobs are typically created, even if the overall trend might be negative. The claim suggests a complete absence of private job creation over a span of more than a decade, which is not supported by general economic trends and data.

"""Argentina has a record tax burden in Latin America""",true,es,"The claim that ""Argentina has a record tax burden in Latin America"" is a complex one that requires examination of various factors including tax rates, types of taxes, and comparisons with other countries in the region.

As of recent data, Argentina does have one of the highest tax burdens in Latin America. The tax burden is typically measured as a percentage of the country's GDP. According to various economic reports and analyses, Argentina's tax burden often ranks among the highest in the region. This is due to a combination of high income taxes, value-added taxes, and other levies.

However, it is important to note that the ""record"" nature of the tax burden can fluctuate based on changes in policies, economic conditions, and comparisons with other countries. Therefore, while Argentina consistently has a high tax burden, claiming it has the ""record"" tax burden might oversimplify a more nuanced situation.

Given these considerations, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but with some potential for variability and context.

As of the latest available information, the world's largest natural gas reserves are typically attributed to countries like Russia, Iran, Qatar, and the United States. If the gas deposit off Saint-Louis were indeed the 5th largest in the world, it would be a significant and well-publicized discovery. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, there have been no widely recognized reports indicating that a gas deposit off Saint-Louis (likely referring to Saint-Louis, Senegal) constitutes the 5th largest reserve globally.

Salvini and the boom of '93,false,it,"To evaluate the claim 'Salvini and the boom of '93', we need to assess the context and the facts related to both Matteo Salvini and the economic situation in Italy in 1993.

1. **Matteo Salvini**: Matteo Salvini is an Italian politician who has been prominent in recent years, particularly as the leader of the Lega Nord (Northern League) party and later as a key figure in Italian politics.

2. **Economic Boom of 1993**: The year 1993 in Italy is not typically associated with an economic boom. In fact, the early 1990s were a period of economic turmoil and political instability in Italy, marked by the Tangentopoli scandal (a nationwide judicial investigation into political corruption) and economic recession.

Given that Matteo Salvini was not a prominent political figure in 1993 and that 1993 was not a year of economic boom in Italy, the claim 'Salvini and the boom of '93' is false.

"Salvini is wrong: on the precompilated 730 we already make ""like Belgium""",true,it,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""on the precompilated 730 we already make 'like Belgium',"" we need to understand the context and the specific elements being compared between Italy's precompilated 730 tax form and Belgium's tax system.

In Italy, the precompilated 730 form is a simplified tax return that is partially pre-filled with information provided by employers, banks, and other entities. This is designed to make the tax filing process easier for taxpayers.

Belgium also has a system where tax returns are partially pre-filled based on information provided by employers and financial institutions. This is similar to the Italian precompilated 730 form in terms of pre-filled information.

Given this context, the claim that Italy's precompilated 730 form is similar to Belgium's system is generally accurate. Both systems aim to simplify tax filing by pre-filling information from various sources.

Loans and tax burden for businesses: have things worsened?,false,it,"To evaluate the claim ""Loans and tax burden for businesses: have things worsened?"", we need to consider several factors, including recent economic trends, government policies, and business conditions.

1. **Loans**:
   - **Interest Rates**: If interest rates have increased, it may indicate that loans have become more expensive, potentially worsening the situation for businesses.
   - **Lending Standards**: If banks have tightened lending standards, it could make it harder for businesses to obtain loans, which could be seen as a worsening condition.
   - **Economic Conditions**: During economic downturns or periods of high uncertainty, access to loans might become more difficult or costly.

2. **Tax Burden**:
   - **Tax Rates**: If there have been recent increases in corporate tax rates, this could indicate a worsening tax burden.
   - **Tax Incentives**: A reduction in tax incentives or credits could also make the tax burden heavier for businesses.
   - **Regulatory Changes**: New regulations or compliance requirements that increase the effective tax burden could also be seen as a worsening condition.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively say whether things have worsened. However, if we assume a general scenario where interest rates have gone up, lending standards have tightened, and there have been no significant tax cuts or incentives, it's plausible to say that the situation has worsened.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data, a balanced assessment would be ""Half True"". The claim could be true in some contexts but requires more detailed analysis to be fully validated.

1. Salvini says that the Democratic Party voted in favor of food insects.
2. Salvini confuses himself with Forza Italia.

Without specific context or evidence, it's difficult to verify the first part of the claim. However, the second part suggests a mix-up or misunderstanding on Salvini's part. If Salvini indeed attributed the vote to the Democratic Party when it was actually Forza Italia, then the claim has some truth to it.

"""Foreigners in Italy [...] affect the rapes for 42 percent [of cases]""",half true,it,"To evaluate the claim that ""Foreigners in Italy affect the rapes for 42 percent [of cases],"" it is necessary to consider reliable data sources that provide information on the nationality of individuals convicted of rape in Italy.

According to various sources, including official statistics and reports from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and other government agencies, the percentage of rapes committed by foreigners in Italy is indeed significant, but it does not reach 42%. Studies and reports generally indicate that foreigners are involved in a substantial portion of reported rape cases, but the exact percentage can vary.

For example, some reports suggest that foreigners account for around 30% to 35% of rape cases in Italy. These figures are based on crime statistics and legal proceedings, which can be influenced by various factors such as reporting rates, convictions, and the demographics of the foreign population in Italy.

Given this information, the claim that foreigners are responsible for 42% of rape cases in Italy is an overestimation. While the percentage is high, it does not reach the stated figure.

2. **Netherlands banning petrol cars by 2025:**
   - The Netherlands has proposed banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2025, but this proposal has faced significant political and practical challenges. It is not yet a firm policy.

3. **India banning petrol cars by 2030:**
   - India has proposed ambitious targets for electric vehicle adoption, but the specific goal of banning petrol cars by 2030 has not been officially adopted. The government has instead set a target of having 30% electric vehicles by 2030.

Given these points, the claim is not entirely accurate but does contain elements of truth:

- Germany aimed for a million electric cars by 2020 but did not achieve it.
- The Netherlands has discussed banning petrol cars by 2025, but it is not yet a concrete policy.
- India has proposed EV targets but has not officially set a ban on petrol cars by 2030.

"""Senegal has lost 5 % of market share over the past ten years"".",false,fr,"To evaluate the claim that ""Senegal has lost 5% of market share over the past ten years,"" we would need specific data on Senegal's market share in various sectors over the past decade. Without access to such data, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, for the sake of argument, let's consider some general points:

1. **Market Share Metrics**: Market share can vary significantly depending on the sector (e.g., agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, etc.). The claim does not specify which market is being referred to.
2. **Economic Trends**: Senegal's economy has been growing, but it has also faced challenges in certain sectors. Loss of market share could be due to increased competition, policy changes, or other economic factors.
3. **Data Availability**: Accurate assessment requires reliable data from sources like the World Bank, IMF, or Senegal's national statistics office.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the claim, it is difficult to confirm or deny its accuracy. Therefore, the most reasonable assessment without additional context or data would be:

"""The metropolitan city of Milan would have a tax residue of 11 billion a year, if we really want to talk about return""",half true,it,"To evaluate the claim that ""The metropolitan city of Milan would have a tax residue of 11 billion a year,"" we need to consider the context and available data.

1. **Tax Residue Definition**: Tax residue typically refers to the difference between the taxes collected in a region and the amount of public spending allocated to that region.

2. **Data Availability**: Economic data, including tax revenues and public expenditures, are usually reported by statistical agencies or government bodies. For Milan, this information would likely come from sources like the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) or the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

3. **Verification**: Without specific data from official sources, it's challenging to verify the exact figure of 11 billion euros. However, it's known that Milan is a significant economic hub in Italy, contributing a substantial amount to the national tax revenue.

4. **Context**: The claim suggests that Milan contributes significantly more in taxes than it receives in public services and benefits. This is a common situation for large economic centers in many countries.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm the exact figure, but acknowledging the general trend that large economic centers often have a significant tax residue, the claim can be considered plausible but not definitively proven.

"""[Electronic vote] is a very simple system, which gives certainty and guarantees""",half true,es,"The claim that ""[Electronic vote] is a very simple system, which gives certainty and guarantees"" is complex and depends on various factors, including the specific electronic voting system being considered, its implementation, security measures, and the context in which it is used.

- **Simplicity:** The simplicity of an electronic voting system can vary. Some systems are designed to be user-friendly, while others may be more complex.
- **Certainty:** Electronic voting systems can provide quick results, but the certainty of those results depends on the system's security, accuracy, and resistance to tampering.
- **Guarantees:** No system is completely foolproof. Electronic voting systems can be vulnerable to hacking, software bugs, and other forms of manipulation if not properly secured and audited.

Given these considerations, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth.

"On Twitter, the PSD writes that the unemployment rate in Portugal is n ......",mostly true,pt,"To evaluate the claim about the unemployment rate in Portugal made by the PSD on Twitter, we need to verify it against reliable and recent data. Unfortunately, without the specific value provided in the claim or access to the latest unemployment statistics, we cannot directly assess its accuracy.

However, let's assume we have the necessary data. We would compare the claimed unemployment rate with the most recent official statistics provided by reputable sources such as Eurostat, the OECD, or Portugal's National Statistics Institute (INE).

For the sake of this example, let's say the claim states the unemployment rate is 6%, and the most recent official data shows it is 6.5%.

Given this hypothetical scenario:

- **True**: The claim would be considered 'True' if the official data exactly matched the claimed rate.
- **Mostly True**: If the official data is very close to the claimed rate (e.g., within a small margin of error), the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- **Half True**: If the official data is somewhat different but still reasonably close, it would be 'Half True'.
- **Mostly False**: If the official data significantly differs from the claimed rate but has some minor similarities, it would be 'Mostly False'.
- **False**: If the official data is completely different from the claimed rate, the claim would be 'False'.

In our hypothetical example, the claim of 6% would be considered 'Mostly True' because it is very close to the official rate of 6.5%.

"""Only 7% of municipalities in Senegal have an urban planning plan""",true,fr,"To verify the claim that ""Only 7% of municipalities in Senegal have an urban planning plan,"" we would need to refer to reliable data from official sources such as government reports, international development organizations, or academic studies.

Without access to specific data, I can provide a general approach to evaluating such a claim:

1. **Check Official Reports:** Look for reports from the Senegalese government or ministries involved in urban planning.
2. **International Organizations:** Check data from organizations like the World Bank, United Nations, or other international development agencies that monitor urban planning and development in African countries.
3. **Academic Studies:** Review any recent academic studies or research papers that focus on urban planning in Senegal.

If the available data supports that approximately 7% of municipalities in Senegal have an urban planning plan, then the claim would be considered true or mostly true. If the data significantly differs, the claim would be considered mostly false or false.

Without specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the general approach, if reliable sources confirm the figure, the claim could be considered true.

**Final Answer: Mostly True** (assuming reliable sources confirm the figure, otherwise further verification is needed).",,False,True
"""Argentina was the third world exporter of meat, today we are the 14th""",true,es,"The claim that ""Argentina was the third world exporter of meat, today we are the 14th"" needs to be evaluated based on historical and current data on meat exports.

Historically, Argentina was one of the top meat exporters in the world. During the early 20th century, Argentina was indeed one of the leading exporters of beef. However, its position has fluctuated over the years due to various factors such as economic policies, market conditions, and changes in the global meat industry.

As of recent data, Argentina's ranking in meat exports has indeed declined. According to various sources, Argentina is no longer among the top three meat exporters. While the exact ranking can vary slightly depending on the source and the specific year, it is generally agreed that Argentina's position has dropped significantly.

Given the historical context and the general trend of Argentina's decline in meat export rankings, the claim that ""Argentina was the third world exporter of meat, today we are the 14th"" is mostly accurate, although the exact current ranking might need verification from the latest data.

1. **""The government has decided to kill companies.""** This is a subjective interpretation and not a factual statement that can be verified.

2. **""With DL, the one who renovates an apartment pays half an amount, the other 50 percent the company finds it as a 'tax bonus' spread in 5 years.""** This suggests a specific tax incentive program (referred to as ""DL"") where individuals pay half the cost of renovations, and companies receive a tax bonus for the other half, spread over five years. Without specific details about the program (such as its name or jurisdiction), it's difficult to verify this part of the claim.

3. **""Instead of squeezing companies like lemons the state lowers taxes!""** This is a general statement about tax policy, suggesting that the government is reducing taxes on companies rather than increasing them. Again, without specific details, it's hard to verify this claim.

Given the lack of specific, verifiable information, the claim cannot be fully substantiated or refuted. Therefore, the most accurate assessment is:

As of my last update in October 2023, Ethiopia has indeed shown significant economic growth, often ranking among the fastest-growing economies. However, the claim that it is the ""fastest growth economy in the world"" can vary depending on the specific year and the metrics used (e.g., GDP growth rate).

In recent years, countries like Bangladesh and some African nations have also shown very high growth rates. Therefore, while Ethiopia has been one of the fastest-growing economies, it may not always be the absolute fastest in every year.

Given this context, the claim is largely accurate but not definitively true for every time period.

A can of beer has fewer calories than a dose of caipirinha,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the typical calorie content of a can of beer with that of a dose of caipirinha.

A standard 12-ounce can of beer typically contains around 150-200 calories, depending on the type of beer. For example, a light beer might have around 100-120 calories, while a regular beer might have around 150-170 calories.

A standard dose of caipirinha, which is made with cachaça, sugar, and lime, typically contains around 200-250 calories. The calorie content can vary based on the amount of sugar and cachaça used.

Given these ranges, it is generally true that a can of beer has fewer calories than a dose of caipirinha.

"""Growth has gone from -2 to +1: no country, in the same period she made such a big leap""",false,it,"To evaluate the claim, ""Growth has gone from -2 to +1: no country, in the same period she made such a big leap,"" we need to consider both the factual accuracy and the comparative claim.

1. **Factual Accuracy**: The statement claims that growth has gone from -2 to +1. This can be verified with economic data. If the data supports this change in growth rate, then this part of the claim is true.

2. **Comparative Claim**: The statement asserts that no other country has made such a big leap in the same period. This is a comparative claim that requires a thorough examination of global economic data to verify. If there is evidence that other countries have made similar or greater leaps during the same period, then this part of the claim is false.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively classify the statement. However, based on the typical complexity and variability of economic growth rates across countries, it's likely that some countries have experienced similar or even more significant changes in growth rates over comparable periods.

Given the lack of specific data to support the comparative claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is not entirely accurate.

"""The safety standards of the safety systems on which our trains travel, not only [...] high -speed trains are at the top""",true,it,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and available data regarding the safety standards of train systems, particularly high-speed trains. Generally, high-speed trains are designed with advanced safety systems to ensure passenger safety. However, without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false.

High-speed trains in many regions, such as Japan, Europe, and China, are known for their rigorous safety standards and excellent safety records. However, the claim implies that the safety standards are at the top universally, which might not be the case for every region or every high-speed train system.

Given the lack of specific data but acknowledging the generally high safety standards of many high-speed train systems, the claim can be considered mostly true.

- The CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) in France has around 11,000 researchers.
- The CSIC (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas) in Spain has around 3,000 researchers.

Given these numbers:

- CONICET's limit of 14,000 researchers is indeed higher than the number of researchers in both the CNRS and CSIC.

As of 2020, approximately 60% of the Nigerian population had access to at least basic drinking water services, and the percentage without access to safely managed drinking water services was around 40-50%. Therefore, the claim that 80% do not have access to drinking water is inaccurate.

"""[Immune] would have its effectiveness only if every Italian citizen, of all ages, had the app on his smartphone""",false,it,"To evaluate the claim that the Immune app would have its effectiveness only if every Italian citizen, of all ages, had the app on his smartphone, we need to consider the intended purpose of such an app and the factors that influence its effectiveness.

The Immune app, like other contact tracing apps, is designed to help track and alert individuals who have been in close proximity to someone who has tested positive for a disease (e.g., COVID-19). The effectiveness of such apps generally increases with higher adoption rates, as more data points allow for more accurate tracking and alerting.

However, claiming that the app would have its effectiveness ""only if every Italian citizen, of all ages, had the app on his smartphone"" is an overstatement. While high adoption rates significantly enhance the app's usefulness, it is not necessary for every single citizen to have the app for it to have some level of effectiveness. Partial adoption can still provide valuable data and help in contact tracing efforts.

"""The advice [of the Magistracy] does not work, it is braking""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""The advice [of the Magistracy] does not work, it is braking,"" it is important to understand the context and the specific evidence supporting or refuting this statement. However, without additional context or evidence, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

That said, the phrase ""it is braking"" suggests a typo or misuse of the word ""braking"" instead of ""breaking"" or ""not working."" This could indicate a misunderstanding or miscommunication.

Given the lack of context and the potential misuse of language, the claim seems to be unverifiable as presented. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization based on the information available is:

"""The teaching salary is $ 4,000 below the poverty line for the degree teacher""",half true,es,"To evaluate the claim that the teaching salary is $4,000 below the poverty line for the degree teacher, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Teaching Salaries**: Teaching salaries can vary widely depending on the location, type of institution, and the teacher's level of experience and education.
2. **Poverty Line**: The poverty line also varies by location and household size. For example, in the United States, the federal poverty level for a single person is different from that for a family of four.
3. **Degree Teacher**: The term ""degree teacher"" is vague. It could refer to teachers with a bachelor's degree, master's degree, or higher. Salaries typically increase with higher levels of education.

Given the variability in both teaching salaries and the poverty line, it is unlikely that a blanket statement like this would be universally true. There may be specific cases where a teacher's salary is $4,000 below the poverty line, but this would not be representative of the majority of teachers.

The number of deaths from police intervention has already surpassed the murder (robbery followed by death),true,pt,"To evaluate the claim 'The number of deaths from police intervention has already surpassed the murder (robbery followed by death),' we would need to refer to reliable data sources that track deaths from police intervention and murders resulting from robberies.

However, without specific data, we can make some general observations:

1. **Deaths from Police Intervention**: This typically includes deaths that occur during arrests, altercations, or other forms of police activity.
2. **Murders (Robbery Followed by Death)**: This category specifically refers to homicides that occur during the commission of a robbery.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, it is challenging to make a definitive determination. However, it is known that statistics on police intervention deaths and robbery-related homicides can vary significantly by country and year.

In the absence of precise data, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as possibly true but requiring verification. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization might be 'Half True,' indicating that while it could be accurate in some contexts, it needs further verification.

"""We are the country with fewer deaths from the world""",false,es,"To evaluate the claim ""We are the country with fewer deaths from the world,"" we need to consider the context and available data. The claim can be interpreted as stating that a specific country has the lowest number of deaths in the world, which is a very strong and specific assertion.

Without specifying which country is being referred to and without providing a time frame or context (e.g., deaths from a specific cause, overall mortality rate, etc.), it is difficult to verify this claim accurately. However, it is highly unlikely that any country can claim to have the absolute lowest number of deaths in the world, considering the variations in population size, health systems, and reporting standards.

Therefore, without more specific information, the claim is likely exaggerated or incorrect.

Since I don't have real-time access to external databases or current reports, I'll guide you on how to verify this information:

1. **Official Reports**: Check the latest annual reports or financial statements published by the Bank of Italy (Banca d'Italia). These documents often include detailed information about the number of employees and salary ranges.

2. **Government Websites**: Look for official government or central bank websites that might provide statistics on employment and compensation in the public sector.

3. **News Articles**: Search for recent news articles from reputable sources that discuss the employment and salary details of Bankitalia.

4. **Industry Reports**: Financial industry reports or analyses might provide insights into the staffing and compensation practices of central banks.

Without specific data, it's challenging to verify the exact figures. However, based on general knowledge of central bank operations, the numbers provided (7,000 employees and an average salary of 85 thousand euros) are plausible but require confirmation.

Without specific data, it's challenging to give a definitive answer. However, if we consider typical patterns of migration and the availability of data from organizations like the International Organization for Migration (IOM) or the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), we can make an educated assessment.

If recent data from these organizations indicates that Ivorians do make up approximately 10% of migrants arriving in Italy by sea, the claim would be considered true or mostly true. If the data shows a significantly different percentage, the claim might be considered half true, mostly false, or false.

Given the lack of specific data in this response, I would lean towards a cautious assessment without definitive proof.

"""There are so many thousands of people who want to adopt and thousands of children who want a home""",mostly true,es,"While there are indeed many people who want to adopt and many children who need homes, the claim oversimplifies a complex issue. There are significant barriers to adoption, including legal, financial, and bureaucratic hurdles. Additionally, not all children waiting for adoption are infants or very young children, which is what many prospective adoptive parents desire. Many children in the foster care system waiting for adoption are older or have special needs. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

The European infringement procedure has been saved thanks to our electronic billing.,half true,it,"To evaluate the claim ""The European infringement procedure has been saved thanks to our electronic billing,"" we need to consider the plausibility and context of the statement.

1. **Plausibility**: The claim suggests that electronic billing has played a significant role in resolving or preventing infringement procedures within the European Union. This is a bold claim that would require substantial evidence to support.

2. **Context**: Infringement procedures in the EU are complex legal processes that involve multiple steps, including formal notices, reasoned opinions, and potential referrals to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Electronic billing, while potentially improving efficiency and transparency, is unlikely to be the sole or primary factor in resolving such procedures.

3. **Evidence**: Without specific evidence or data to support the claim that electronic billing has ""saved"" the infringement procedure, it is difficult to accept the statement as entirely true.

Given these considerations, the claim appears to exaggerate the impact of electronic billing on the infringement procedure. While electronic billing may have contributed to improvements, it is unlikely to be the sole saving factor.

"""Buenos Aires is the most unequal city in the country""",false,es,"To evaluate the claim ""Buenos Aires is the most unequal city in the country,"" we need to consider the context and available data on income inequality across different cities in the country.

In Argentina, income inequality is typically measured using the Gini coefficient, where a higher Gini coefficient indicates greater inequality. Buenos Aires, being the capital and largest city, does have significant income disparities. However, other cities in Argentina, such as those in the northern regions, often exhibit even higher levels of inequality due to various socio-economic factors.

Without specific data to support the claim that Buenos Aires is the most unequal city, it is difficult to definitively say it is the most unequal. It is more accurate to say that while Buenos Aires has notable inequality, it may not be the most unequal compared to other cities with potentially higher Gini coefficients.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"""Social spending in the nation is more than 75% of the budget""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim ""Social spending in the nation is more than 75% of the budget,"" we need to consider the typical breakdown of government budgets. In most nations, social spending includes areas like healthcare, education, social security, and welfare. The percentage of the budget allocated to these areas can vary significantly by country and year.

In many developed countries, social spending can be substantial, but it is rare for it to exceed 75% of the total budget. For example, in the United States, social spending typically represents around 60-65% of the federal budget. In European countries, social spending can be higher, but it still usually falls below 75%.

Given this context, the claim that social spending is more than 75% of the budget is likely an overestimation for most nations.

Without such data, it is impossible to definitively rate the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have some context and data:

- If there is strong evidence showing a significant reduction in homicides over two years, the claim could be rated as 'True' or 'Mostly True.'
- If the evidence is mixed or shows only a modest reduction, it might be rated as 'Half True.'

We have 40% of the prison population of provisional prisoners,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""We have 40% of the prison population of provisional prisoners,"" we need specific data on the prison population and the proportion of provisional prisoners. Without access to current and accurate data, it's impossible to definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have some context or data that suggests the percentage of provisional prisoners in the prison population is significantly different from 40%. If the actual percentage is much lower or higher, the claim would be considered inaccurate.

Given the lack of specific data, the most conservative approach would be to consider the claim as potentially misleading without further evidence.

Gas discoveries in Senegal place Senegal in 27th in the world and 5th in Africa in terms of reserves.,half true,fr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the most recent and reliable data available on natural gas reserves. As of my current knowledge cutoff in 2023, Senegal has indeed made significant gas discoveries, particularly with the development of the Grand Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) gas field, which it shares with Mauritania. However, specific rankings can change frequently based on new discoveries and updates in reserve estimates.

Without up-to-the-minute data, it's challenging to verify the exact ranking of Senegal globally and within Africa. However, based on general knowledge and notable gas discoveries, Senegal has risen in prominence but may not yet be among the top 27 globally or the top 5 in Africa. These rankings are typically held by countries with long-established and larger reserve bases.

Given the uncertainty and the likelihood that Senegal's reserves, while substantial, may not yet place it in the top 27 globally or top 5 in Africa, the claim is best described as:

The trade balance is calculated as follows:
Trade Balance = Value of Exports - Value of Imports

Given:
- Value of Exports = 1,500 billion FCFA
- Value of Imports = 3,500 billion FCFA

Trade Balance = 1,500 billion FCFA - 3,500 billion FCFA = -2,000 billion FCFA

According to various sources, the average global internet speed in 2015 was indeed around 4.5 Mbps. However, as of the most recent data available, the average global internet speed has increased significantly. As of 2023, the average global internet speed is reported to be around 30-40 Mbps, which is much more than triple the speed of 4.5 Mbps.

Given this information, the claim that the current average internet speed is triple what it was in 2015 is actually an understatement. The current speeds are much higher than triple the 2015 speeds.

"""In 2002 there were laws that prohibited dismissals and that did not bring more work, destroyed work""",false,es,"The claim that ""In 2002 there were laws that prohibited dismissals and that did not bring more work, destroyed work"" is a complex statement that likely requires context-specific information to evaluate fully. However, generally speaking, laws that prohibit dismissals are often aimed at protecting workers' rights and providing job security. Whether such laws ""destroyed work"" or not is a matter of economic interpretation and depends on various factors such as the specific labor market conditions, the broader economic context, and the implementation of the laws.

Without specific data or a detailed analysis of the economic impact of such laws in 2002, it is difficult to definitively classify the statement as entirely true or false. However, it is reasonable to say that while such laws may have had unintended consequences, the assertion that they ""destroyed work"" is likely an overstatement.

Without additional context or specific details, it is challenging to verify the accuracy of this claim.

However, if we assume that the claim refers to financial support or funding received by Radio Radicale since 1994, the following factors should be considered:

1. **Official Records**: Checking official records or financial statements of Radio Radicale to verify the amount received.
2. **Independent Reports**: Looking for independent reports or audits that confirm the financial support.
3. **Contextual Information**: Understanding the nature of the support (e.g., government subsidies, private donations, etc.).

"Without Lombardy, Italy is (almost) as Germany and Denmark",mostly true,it,"To evaluate the claim 'Without Lombardy, Italy is (almost) as Germany and Denmark,' we need to consider various factors such as geography, economics, culture, and politics.

1. **Geography**: Lombardy is a significant region in northern Italy, known for its industrial and economic importance. Removing Lombardy would indeed impact Italy's economic landscape but wouldn't necessarily make Italy similar to Germany or Denmark in terms of geography.

2. **Economics**: Lombardy is one of the wealthiest regions in Italy and contributes significantly to Italy's GDP. Without Lombardy, Italy's economic profile would change, but it wouldn't automatically align with the economic structures of Germany or Denmark, which have their own unique economic models and strengths.

3. **Culture**: Italy, Germany, and Denmark have distinct cultural identities. Removing Lombardy from Italy would not change the fundamental cultural differences between these countries.

4. **Politics**: The political systems and histories of Italy, Germany, and Denmark are unique. Removing Lombardy would not make Italy's political landscape similar to that of Germany or Denmark.

Given these considerations, the claim that 'Without Lombardy, Italy is (almost) as Germany and Denmark' is overly simplistic and does not accurately reflect the complexities and differences between these countries.

Without this additional information, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the statement.

However, based on the general lack of specificity and the high figure quoted, it seems unlikely that such a large sum would be spent on football without significant public discussion and documentation. Therefore, without further evidence, the claim appears to be exaggerated or inaccurate.

However, without specific data on the exact amount of the debt issuance in question and how it compares to other developing countries' debt issuances since 1996, it is difficult to definitively confirm or refute the claim.

That said, Argentina's economic history includes major financial crises and debt restructurings, which have often involved substantial foreign currency debt. The claim suggests that this particular issuance would be the largest since 1996, which would imply a significant financial event.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there is no specific data provided in the claim to verify its accuracy. However, it's known that the political landscape in Argentina, including the Conurbano Bonaerense, can have long-serving mayors in some districts. Without precise data, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact average tenure.

Given the lack of specific data in the claim and the general knowledge of political tenures, it's reasonable to assume that while some districts may have mayors serving for many years, the claim of an average of 15 years across all districts might be an overestimation.

The unemployment rate in Côte d'Ivoire is between 70 and 90 %.,mostly true,fr,"To evaluate the claim that ""The unemployment rate in Côte d'Ivoire is between 70 and 90%,"" we need to consider reliable sources of economic data.

According to various international organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the unemployment rate in Côte d'Ivoire is typically reported to be much lower than the range of 70 to 90%. For example, as of recent data, the unemployment rate in Côte d'Ivoire is typically reported to be around 2-3% for the urban areas and somewhat higher but still not exceeding 10% for the national average.

Given this discrepancy, the claim that the unemployment rate is between 70 and 90% is significantly overstated.

"""Every three minutes a family receives a 30 -year mortgage loan from Banco Nación""",half true,es,"To evaluate the claim ""'Every three minutes a family receives a 30-year mortgage loan from Banco Nación,'"" we need to consider whether it is statistically feasible and supported by evidence.

1. **Statistical Feasibility**: If Banco Nación grants a 30-year mortgage loan every three minutes, that would amount to 20 loans per hour (60 minutes / 3 minutes per loan). Over 24 hours, this would be 480 loans per day.

2. **Evidence Support**: Without specific data from Banco Nación or an authoritative source, it is difficult to verify the claim accurately. Typically, large financial institutions publish annual reports or press releases that include such statistics.

3. **Contextual Consideration**: The claim could be plausible if Banco Nación has a very efficient mortgage approval process and a high demand for such loans. However, without concrete data, it remains speculative.

Given the lack of specific data to support or refute the claim, the most reasonable assessment would be that the claim is plausible but not definitively proven.

Explanation: The claim states that the budget deficit rose from 6.7% in 2011 to 3.7% in 2019. However, a rise in the budget deficit would mean the percentage increased over time, but the numbers given show a decrease from 6.7% to 3.7%.

However, based on the given statement alone, it seems to imply a comparison with others without providing specific data or a clear comparison group. Without additional information, it's challenging to definitively classify the claim.

That being said, the statement is phrased in a way that suggests a nuanced or qualified truth, which often falls under categories like 'Mostly True' or 'Half True' when some level of uncertainty or incomplete information is present.

“Time for elaboration of each vaccine (...) typhoid fever (...) 105 years (...) COVID-19 (...) 5 months”,mostly true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the timelines for the development of vaccines for typhoid fever and COVID-19.

1. **Typhoid Fever Vaccine**: The first effective vaccine against typhoid fever was developed by Almroth Wright, Richard Pfeiffer, and Wilhelm Kolle in 1896. This aligns with the claim of approximately 105 years ago from the present day.

2. **COVID-19 Vaccine**: The first COVID-19 vaccines were developed and approved for emergency use within roughly a year from the start of the pandemic, which was around late 2019 to early 2020. Therefore, the claim of 5 months for the COVID-19 vaccine is not accurate; it was closer to 12 months.

Given these timelines, the claim is partially correct regarding the typhoid fever vaccine but incorrect regarding the COVID-19 vaccine.

As of the latest reports from credible sources such as New World Wealth and AfrAsia Bank Africa Wealth Report, South Africa consistently ranks as the African country with the most millionaires.

"""Investments in school infrastructure were never made in the city's history as in our management""",half true,es,"To evaluate the claim ""Investments in school infrastructure were never made in the city's history as in our management,"" we need to consider several factors such as historical investment data, the scope and scale of current investments, and comparative analyses with previous administrations. Without specific data or context, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, claims of this nature often require substantial evidence to be fully substantiated.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim could be considered ""Half True"" if there is evidence of significant investments under the current management but not enough to definitively prove that no previous administration has invested as much. If there is clear evidence that previous administrations have made comparable or greater investments, the claim would lean towards ""Mostly False"" or ""False.""

"Report prepared by TCU, from the evaluation of the arrival of doctors in 1,837 municipalities, translates some of the impacts already felt by the population: 33% more monthly consultations on primary care in these municipalities",half true,pt,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we would need to verify the source and the data provided by TCU (Tribunal de Contas da União) regarding the evaluation of the arrival of doctors in 1,837 municipalities. Specifically, we need to confirm whether there was indeed a 33% increase in monthly consultations in primary care in these municipalities.

Since I don't have real-time access to verify the specific report or data from TCU, I will base my assessment on the typical reliability of TCU reports and the plausibility of the claim. TCU is a reputable governmental oversight body in Brazil, and their reports are generally considered reliable. However, without direct access to the report, it's challenging to confirm the exact percentage increase.

Given the context and the source, it is reasonable to assume that the claim has some basis in fact, but without verification, we cannot confirm it as entirely true.

While Africa did experience significant economic growth during that period, the growth rates varied across different years and countries. According to data from the World Bank, the average annual GDP growth rate for Sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2015 was around 5%, but there were fluctuations and some years saw lower growth rates. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that the growth rate was almost 5% consistently for 15 years.

"""Inflation in 80 years has been, on average, 62.5% without counting the years of hyperinflation""",half true,es,"To evaluate the claim ""Inflation in 80 years has been, on average, 62.5% without counting the years of hyperinflation,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of Inflation**: Inflation is typically measured as an annual percentage increase in the general level of prices for goods and services.

2. **Historical Data**: Inflation rates can vary significantly from year to year and from country to country. Averaging inflation over 80 years without specific context (like which country or which specific years) makes the claim difficult to verify without additional information.

3. **Exclusion of Hyperinflation**: Hyperinflation is defined as a very high and typically accelerating inflation rate. Excluding these years could significantly affect the average inflation rate, but without knowing which years are excluded, it's hard to assess the accuracy of the 62.5% figure.

4. **Typical Inflation Rates**: In many developed economies, inflation rates typically range from 2% to 10% annually. An average of 62.5% over 80 years seems unusually high for most stable economies.

Given these considerations, the claim appears to be overstated without more specific context or data to support it. Therefore, the most likely assessment is:

Comparison misses the growth of the Eurozone,false,it,"To evaluate the claim ""Comparison misses the growth of the Eurozone,"" we need to consider the context and available data. The claim seems to suggest that certain comparisons or analyses do not fully account for the economic growth within the Eurozone.

The Eurozone has experienced varying levels of economic growth over the years. While there have been periods of stagnation and crisis, there have also been periods of growth. The accuracy of the claim depends on the specific comparisons being referenced.

Without additional context or specific data, it is difficult to definitively label this claim as entirely true or false. However, it is reasonable to acknowledge that some comparisons might indeed overlook or understate the growth of the Eurozone, especially if they focus on short-term fluctuations or specific sectors.

Would the minimum Italian salary be the most generous among OECD countries?,half true,it,"To evaluate the claim that ""the minimum Italian salary is the most generous among OECD countries,"" we need to consider the data on minimum wages across OECD countries.

As of recent data, the minimum wage in Italy is not among the highest in the OECD. Countries like Luxembourg, Australia, and New Zealand have significantly higher minimum wages when adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). Furthermore, some OECD countries do not have a legally mandated minimum wage, relying instead on collective bargaining agreements that often result in higher wages than a statutory minimum.

Therefore, the claim that the minimum Italian salary is the most generous among OECD countries is not accurate.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to provide an accurate assessment. However, I can guide you through the process of evaluating such a claim:

1. **Identify the Source and Context**: Determine what specific claims Carlo Calenda made about the growth of exports and employment in the South.
2. **Verify the Data**: Look for reliable sources that provide data on exports and employment growth in the South. Official government statistics, economic reports, and reputable news articles can be useful.
3. **Compare the Claims**: Match the data you find with the claims made by Calenda to see if they align.
4. **Evaluate the Accuracy**: Based on the comparison, determine if Calenda's claims are fully supported by the data, partially supported, or not supported at all.

Given the lack of specific data in your prompt, here is a general approach to evaluating the claim:

- **True**: If the data fully supports Calenda's claims.
- **Mostly True**: If the data largely supports Calenda's claims but there are minor discrepancies.
- **Half True**: If the data partially supports Calenda's claims but there are significant discrepancies or omissions.
- **Mostly False**: If the data mostly contradicts Calenda's claims.

Without such data, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to how one might assess this claim:

1. **Identify Reliable Sources**: Look for economic reports, trade statistics, or market analysis from reputable organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, or Senegalese government economic reports.
2. **Analyze Trends**: Examine the trend of France's market share in Senegal over the past ten years to see if there has been a significant decline.
3. **Compare Percentages**: Calculate the percentage change in market share to determine if it aligns with the 25% decrease mentioned in the claim.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, a general assessment based on typical economic trends and the complexity of international trade would suggest that such a claim could be plausible but requires verification.

As of my last update, specific rankings and detailed data on the efficiency of health systems globally can vary depending on the criteria used (e.g., accessibility, quality of care, infrastructure, etc.). However, it is known that many African countries, including Côte d'Ivoire, face significant challenges in their health systems due to factors such as limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and shortages of healthcare professionals.

Without the most recent and specific data, a precise ranking is difficult to confirm. However, given the general knowledge about the state of healthcare in many African nations, it is plausible that Côte d'Ivoire could be among those with less efficient health systems.

Without such detailed information, it is challenging to provide a precise assessment. However, based on general political discourse and the tendency for politicians to use rhetoric that may exaggerate or downplay certain issues, we can offer a cautious evaluation.

**Analysis:**
1. **Context**: Matteo Renzi, a former Italian Prime Minister and a prominent figure in Italian politics, has been known for his strong statements and critiques, which sometimes can be perceived as exaggerations.
2. **Comparative Analysis**: The claim involves a comparison between the Democratic Party (PD) and the Five Star Movement (M5S). Renunciations or resignations can be influenced by various factors, including internal party dynamics, political scandals, and electoral outcomes.
3. **Data Requirement**: To verify the claim, we would need comparative data on the number of renunciations in both parties over a specific period and the context in which these renunciations occurred.

**Conclusion**: Without concrete data, it is difficult to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false. However, given the nature of political rhetoric and the likelihood of exaggeration, a balanced assessment would be:

According to data from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and other similar reports, the adolescent birth rate in sub-Saharan Africa is indeed high. For example, the UNFPA has reported that many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have adolescent birth rates exceeding 100 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19, which translates to a significant percentage of births occurring during adolescence.

"""If you look this year's budget, it has only been executed in 12%""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim, we need more context and specific data regarding the budget execution for the year in question. Without additional information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

However, based on the provided claim alone, which states that the budget has only been executed in 12%, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the budget execution is indeed 12%, the claim would be true.
- If the budget execution is close to 12%, but not exactly, it might be categorized as 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.
- If the budget execution is significantly different from 12%, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

2. **Economy**: The Netherlands has one of the strongest economies in the EU. It is a founding member of the EU and the Eurozone, and its GDP per capita is among the highest in the EU.

3. **Political Influence**: The Netherlands plays a significant role in EU politics. It is known for its active participation in EU decision-making processes and has held the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU multiple times.

Given these factors, it is inaccurate to describe the Netherlands as a ""Lilliput"" within the EU. While it is not the largest or most powerful member, it is certainly not insignificant.

As of my last update in October 2023, specific details on Nigeria's debt levels can vary, and without real-time data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on historical trends and available data up to that point, Nigeria's external debt has been increasing but may not have reached $80 billion.

Violence against women affects more black women,true,pt,"The claim 'Violence against women affects more black women' is complex and requires nuanced understanding. According to various studies and reports, such as those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), black women do experience higher rates of certain types of violence, including intimate partner violence and homicide, compared to women of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, it's important to note that violence against women is a widespread issue that affects women of all backgrounds.

For instance, the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that about 4 in 10 black women have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetimes, compared to about 3 in 10 white women. However, the rates of sexual violence were similar across racial and ethnic groups.

Therefore, while it's accurate to say that black women experience higher rates of certain types of violence, the claim could be misleading if it suggests that violence against women is not a serious issue for women of other backgrounds.

1. **Historical Comparison**: We would need to look at the size, scope, and impact of previous police recruitment campaigns to determine if the current one is indeed the largest.
2. **Current Campaign Details**: The claimant should provide specifics about the current campaign, such as the number of recruits, the budget allocated, the geographical scope, and any innovative strategies being employed.

Without access to such data, we can only speculate. For a definitive answer, we would need:
- Official records of past recruitment campaigns.
- Quantifiable metrics of the current campaign.
- Independent verification from reliable sources.

1960 There were only 3% of literate women.If we look today we are not satisfied because we have 46-47%,false,fr,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we need to consider historical and current data on women's literacy rates.

In 1960, the global literacy rate for women was indeed quite low, though the exact percentage can vary by region. According to UNESCO data, the global average for women's literacy in 1960 was around 40%, but in many developing countries, it was significantly lower, often below 10%.

As of recent data, the global literacy rate for women has improved substantially. According to UNESCO, the global average for women's literacy in 2021 is around 83%. However, there are still regions where the literacy rate for women is much lower than the global average.

Given these figures, the claim that there were only 3% literate women in 1960 is likely an underestimation for the global average but could be accurate for specific regions. The current claim of 46-47% literacy rate for women is significantly lower than the global average but might reflect specific regional or local contexts.

Based on this analysis, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth, particularly when considering regional variations.

Italy risks losing over 60 million foreign tourists,true,it,"To evaluate the claim ""Italy risks losing over 60 million foreign tourists,"" we need contextual information such as the source of the claim, the timeframe, and relevant data on tourism trends in Italy. Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge of tourism statistics and the impact of global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, we can make an educated guess.

Italy is a major tourist destination, typically attracting tens of millions of tourists annually. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, significantly impacted tourism worldwide, including Italy. If the claim is based on recent data affected by such global events, it could be plausible.

Without specific data, the claim appears to be within the realm of possibility but not definitively verifiable. Therefore, it seems reasonable to classify it as:

"""The credit doubled its participation in the GDP between 2003 and 2013""",half true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""the credit doubled its participation in the GDP between 2003 and 2013,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of Terms**: ""Credit participation in GDP"" typically refers to the ratio of total credit to GDP. This is a measure of how much credit (loans, debt, etc.) is extended in the economy relative to the size of the economy (GDP).

2. **Data Verification**: To verify this claim, we would need to look at historical data on total credit and GDP for the years 2003 and 2013. This data is usually available from national statistical agencies or international financial institutions like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

3. **Calculation**: We would calculate the ratio of total credit to GDP for both years and compare them to see if the ratio indeed doubled.

Without specific data, it's not possible to provide a precise answer. However, based on general economic trends and typical patterns, such a dramatic increase in the credit-to-GDP ratio over a decade is plausible in some economic contexts, especially during periods of rapid economic growth or financial liberalization.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim could be considered plausible but requires verification. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization without concrete data is:

"""The crime increasingly increases in the province of Buenos Aires""",half true,es,"To accurately evaluate the claim ""The crime increasingly increases in the province of Buenos Aires,"" we would need to examine recent crime statistics and trends. However, without access to real-time data or specific sources, we can consider general trends and reports.

Historically, crime rates in the province of Buenos Aires have been a concern, and there have been fluctuations over the years. Recent reports suggest that while some types of crimes may have decreased, others, such as property crimes and violent crimes, have been on the rise. This indicates a mixed trend rather than a straightforward increase across all types of crimes.

Given the complexity and variability of crime data, the claim that crime is ""increasingly increasing"" is likely an oversimplification. It is more accurate to say that crime rates have shown mixed trends with some categories increasing and others decreasing.

"“The education of the Aracaju City Hall, from public education, was last in the first grades of elementary school and a last in the last grades in the data of recent IDEB”",mostly true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the context and the data provided by IDEB (Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica), which is a Brazilian index that measures the quality of basic education. The claim states that the education of the Aracaju City Hall, specifically public education, ranked last in both the first grades of elementary school and the last grades of elementary school according to recent IDEB data.

Without specific data from the recent IDEB reports, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate IDEB data, we can analyze its plausibility.

1. **First Grades of Elementary School**: If the claim states that Aracaju's public education ranked last in the first grades, this would imply that it had the lowest IDEB score compared to other municipalities.
2. **Last Grades of Elementary School**: Similarly, if the claim states that Aracaju's public education ranked last in the last grades, this would also imply the lowest IDEB score in that category.

Given the context and the typical structure of IDEB reports, it is plausible that a municipality could rank last in specific educational stages. However, without verifying the actual IDEB data, we cannot confirm the claim with certainty.

**Final Answer:** Half True

This response assumes that the claim could be plausible based on IDEB data but requires verification from the actual reports to be fully confirmed.",,False,True
"""The relationship between the crimes committed and the convicted persons is less than 1%""",mostly true,es,"To evaluate the claim ""The relationship between the crimes committed and the convicted persons is less than 1%,"" we need to consider the context and data regarding crime rates and conviction rates.

Generally, crime statistics can vary significantly between different regions, types of crimes, and reporting methods. However, it is highly unlikely that the conviction rate for all crimes committed would be less than 1%. While some types of crimes may have lower conviction rates due to various factors (such as lack of evidence or witnesses), many other types of crimes have higher conviction rates.

Without specific data, it is difficult to provide an exact percentage, but the claim that the relationship is less than 1% is likely an exaggeration.

"""44% of the subsidies are taken by the two tenths of the richest population""",half true,es,"To evaluate the claim ""44% of the subsidies are taken by the two-tenths of the richest population,"" we need to consider the context and available data on subsidy distribution. This claim suggests that a significant portion of subsidies (44%) is received by the wealthiest 20% of the population.

In many economic studies, it is often found that a disproportionate amount of subsidies and government benefits are indeed received by higher-income groups. This can occur due to various factors such as the structure of tax incentives, the ability of wealthier individuals to access and utilize subsidies, and the nature of the subsidies themselves (e.g., homeowner tax deductions, agricultural subsidies).

While the exact percentage can vary depending on the specific subsidies and the country or region being considered, the general trend aligns with the claim. Therefore, without specific data to refute or confirm the exact 44% figure, the claim can be considered plausible but not definitively proven.

Unemployment is at its highest level in Nigeria;More than 10 million young people are unemployed.,half true,fr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we should look at recent data on unemployment in Nigeria. As of my last update in October 2023, Nigeria does face significant unemployment challenges, particularly among young people.

According to various sources, such as the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Nigeria, unemployment rates have been high and have been on the rise. For example, data from the NBS in 2021 indicated that the unemployment rate was around 33.3%, which is indeed high. Additionally, youth unemployment (those aged 15-35) has been a significant concern, with estimates suggesting that millions of young people are unemployed.

However, the exact figure of ""more than 10 million young people"" being unemployed would need to be verified with the most recent and specific data. While it is clear that youth unemployment is a serious issue, the precise number may vary and could be subject to different interpretations based on the data sources and timeframes.

Given the context and the available information, the claim that ""unemployment is at its highest level in Nigeria; more than 10 million young people are unemployed"" is likely to be mostly accurate but may require specific recent data to confirm the exact number of unemployed youth.

"""Kédougou is the region with the highest mortality rate in Senegal""",mostly true,fr,"To evaluate the claim that ""Kédougou is the region with the highest mortality rate in Senegal,"" we would need specific data on mortality rates across different regions of Senegal. However, without access to real-time databases or specific statistics, it is challenging to confirm or deny this claim with absolute certainty.

Generally, factors such as access to healthcare, socio-economic conditions, and environmental factors can significantly impact mortality rates. Kédougou is known for being one of the less developed regions in Senegal, which could contribute to higher mortality rates.

Given the lack of specific data, it is reasonable to consider the claim as potentially true based on the known socio-economic conditions of Kédougou. However, without concrete statistics, we cannot definitively label it as 'True'.

Create a different rate at alternative times - reducing overload at high flow times,true,pt,"The claim ""Create a different rate at alternative times - reducing overload at high flow times"" is generally true as it reflects a common strategy known as ""demand response"" or ""peak pricing"" used in various industries to manage demand and reduce strain on systems during peak hours.

By offering different rates at alternative times, businesses can incentivize customers to shift their usage to off-peak times, thereby reducing the load during high-demand periods. This approach is often employed in electricity, public transportation, and other sectors to balance demand and optimize resource utilization.

We have over 63 million Brazilians in SPC,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""We have over 63 million Brazilians in SPC,"" we need to consider the context and data available about the SPC (Serviço de Proteção ao Crédito), which is a credit protection service in Brazil.

As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely recognized or verified source that reports over 63 million Brazilians being registered in the SPC. The SPC typically reports lower numbers, usually in the range of tens of millions, but not exceeding 63 million.

Given this context, the claim appears to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual data.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide an accurate assessment. However, based on general trends and statistical reports from various regions, we can make an educated guess.

If the claim is made in a context where crime rates, including theft, murder, and homicides, have indeed shown a decline, then the statement could be considered true or mostly true. However, if the claim is made in a context where crime rates have not uniformly decreased, or if the data is mixed, the statement might be considered half true or mostly false.

"""I would like to point out that he did not only do it in Europe [to get"" full powers ""from Parliament], but for example the Swedish premier also did, who is a socialist but of that she will not hear"" (min11:08)",false,it,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components:

1. **""He did not only do it in Europe [to get 'full powers' from Parliament]""**: This part of the claim suggests that someone, presumably a political leader, sought to obtain full powers from Parliament and did so not only in Europe but in other places as well.

2. **""The Swedish premier also did, who is a socialist""**: This part of the claim asserts that the Swedish prime minister, who is a socialist, also sought to obtain full powers from Parliament.

3. **""But of that she will not hear""**: This part implies that someone (presumably the person being addressed) is unwilling to acknowledge or listen to the fact that the Swedish premier did this.

Without specific names, dates, or contexts, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. However, the general historical record can provide some guidance.

- **European context**: There have been instances in European history where leaders sought to consolidate power, often through parliamentary means. However, without specific details, this part of the claim is too vague to verify.

- **Swedish context**: Sweden has a long history of democratic governance, and it is highly unlikely that a Swedish prime minister would seek ""full powers"" in the sense of consolidating authoritarian control. Swedish politics are characterized by consensus and democratic norms.

- **Socialist context**: While the Swedish prime minister might be from a socialist party, this does not inherently imply they would seek authoritarian powers. Socialist leaders in democratic countries typically operate within the bounds of democratic institutions.

Given the lack of specific details and the general implausibility of a Swedish prime minister seeking ""full powers"" in an authoritarian sense, the claim seems dubious.

"""[Internal tourism] from 2013 to 2015 fell into three million passengers""",true,es,"To accurately evaluate the claim that ""[Internal tourism] from 2013 to 2015 fell into three million passengers,"" we need specific data on internal tourism passenger numbers for the years in question. Without such data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, the phrase ""fell into three million passengers"" is vague and could be interpreted in multiple ways.

If the claim is meant to imply that internal tourism passenger numbers dropped to three million, we would need to see a significant decline from previous years to substantiate this. If it means that the number of passengers was around three million consistently from 2013 to 2015, then we would need to verify that these numbers were indeed around three million during those years.

Given the ambiguity and lack of specific data, a reasonable approach would be to consider the claim as lacking sufficient context or evidence to be definitively true or false.

Without specific details about the law or any supporting evidence, it is challenging to accurately assess the claim. However, if the claim is based on a known law or policy that aims to promote investments in tourism in Casamance, it could be considered at least partially true.

"""All PAMI affiliates have the best drug coverage in America""",half true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""All PAMI affiliates have the best drug coverage in America,"" we need to consider several factors such as the scope of the term ""best,"" the variability in drug coverage plans, and the generalizability of the statement.

1. **Scope of ""Best""**: The term ""best"" is subjective and can vary based on different criteria such as cost, range of drugs covered, copayments, deductibles, and accessibility.

2. **Variability in Plans**: Different affiliates may have different plans with varying levels of coverage. It is unlikely that every single affiliate under the PAMI umbrella would have the objectively best drug coverage compared to all other providers in America.

3. **Generalizability**: Making a blanket statement that applies to ""all"" affiliates is difficult to substantiate without comprehensive data that compares all PAMI affiliates' drug coverage plans to all other plans available in the country.

Given these considerations, it is highly unlikely that every single PAMI affiliate has the best drug coverage in America. Therefore, the claim is likely exaggerated and not supported by a comprehensive analysis.

However, generally speaking, 3% of the population is a relatively small fraction, and it is unlikely that only 3% of the global population travels by air. According to various studies and data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a significantly higher percentage of people have traveled by air at least once in their lives.

Therefore, based on general knowledge and available data, the claim that ""3% of the population"" is involved in airlines travel is likely to be inaccurate.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I don't have real-time data access to verify this claim directly. However, I can provide a general approach to how you might verify this claim:

1. **Check EITI Reports**: The EITI publishes regular reports on the transparency of extractive industries in various countries. Look for the most recent report that ranks countries based on their transparency.
2. **Review Transparency International Data**: Transparency International also provides indices and reports on corruption and transparency, which might include information relevant to the extractive industries.
3. **Consult National and Regional Reports**: Sometimes, regional bodies or national audits provide detailed assessments that can help verify such claims.

Given the lack of real-time data, I can't definitively confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, the best I can do is provide a tentative assessment based on general knowledge and the need for verification.

"""The minimum wage will be at $ 2800 and are counted as employed to workers who are charging $ 1700""",mostly true,es,"The claim states that the minimum wage will be at $2800 and that workers earning $1700 are counted as employed. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two aspects:

1. **Minimum Wage**: The claim suggests that the minimum wage is set at $2800. Without specific context or data, it's challenging to verify this figure. However, minimum wage rates vary by country and state, and $2800 is unusually high compared to typical minimum wage standards.

2. **Employment Status**: The claim also states that workers earning $1700 are counted as employed. This part of the claim is more straightforward. Generally, anyone earning any wage (including a wage below the minimum wage) can be considered employed if they are actively working.

Given these points, the claim seems to mix a hypothetical or unlikely minimum wage figure with a generally accurate description of employment status. Therefore, the claim is partially correct but also contains a significant inaccuracy.

Without specific data, we can't definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, the use of the term ""many cities"" suggests a significant but not universal prevalence. If the claim is broadly accurate but not necessarily true in every instance, it might be considered ""Mostly True."" If the claim is true in about half of the cases, it could be ""Half True."" If it is true in only a minority of cases, it might be ""Mostly False."" If it is entirely inaccurate, it would be ""False.""

In 2018, the Committee called on Brazil to allow Lula to exercise his political rights while in prison, and in 2021, the Committee found that Lula's rights were violated during his trial and imprisonment. The Committee criticized the lack of due process and the bias shown by the judge in his case.

While the UN did not explicitly use the term ""legitimate"" to describe Lula's claim, their statements and findings do support the idea that there were significant issues with the accusations and legal process against him.

1. **Identify the Source and Context**: Look for the source of the claim and the context in which it was made. Official economic reports from government agencies or reputable financial institutions are reliable sources.

2. **Check Official Data**: Compare the claim with official inflation data from sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the U.S. or equivalent agencies in other countries. These sources provide monthly and yearly inflation rates.

3. **Analyze the Data**: Calculate the accumulated inflation from January to October. This involves adding up the monthly inflation rates for the period or using the compounded inflation rate if available.

4. **Evaluate the Claim**: Compare the calculated accumulated inflation with the claim of ""in the order of 10%."" If the actual figure is close to 10%, the claim is likely 'True' or 'Mostly True.' If there is a significant deviation, it could be 'Half True,' 'Mostly False,' or 'False.'

We are the political force in Parliament with the highest number of women [...] and also of graduates,half true,it,"To evaluate the claim, we would need to verify the following two statements:

1. The political force in Parliament has the highest number of women.
2. The political force in Parliament has the highest number of graduates.

Without specific data or context, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of these statements. Typically, such claims would need to be backed up by statistical data from the Parliament in question. If the data supports both statements, the claim would be 'True'. If the data supports one statement more than the other, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the data contradicts both statements, it would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific data, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume we have checked the data and found that while the political force does have the highest number of women, it does not have the highest number of graduates. In that case, the claim would be partially accurate.

Without additional information or clarification on what ""the choice"" refers to and the specific circumstances surrounding the claim, it is difficult to assess its truthfulness.

Given the lack of clarity and the fact that the claim does not provide any specific evidence or context, it is reasonable to consider it as unverifiable and potentially misleading.

Without access to such sources, it is not possible to definitively determine the truth of the claim.

I don't have any process that talks about misuse of public money,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""I don't have any process that talks about misuse of public money,"" we need to consider the context in which it is made. The claim suggests that there is no established procedure or protocol in place to address or prevent the misuse of public funds.

Without additional context or specific evidence to support or refute this claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, in general, most public institutions and organizations have some form of accountability and oversight mechanism to prevent the misuse of public money. This could include audits, internal controls, and ethical guidelines.

Given this typical context, the claim that there is no process to address the misuse of public money is likely inaccurate, but without specific details, it's difficult to say it's completely false.

Humanitarian protection only in Italy and Slovakia?Di Maio is wrong,false,it,"To evaluate the claim ""'Humanitarian protection only in Italy and Slovakia? Di Maio is wrong'"" accurately, we need to consider the context and the facts surrounding humanitarian protection policies in various countries.

Humanitarian protection is a form of international protection granted to individuals who are at risk of serious harm but do not qualify for refugee status. It is offered by many countries, not just Italy and Slovakia. For example, countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and others also provide humanitarian protection.

Given this information, the claim that humanitarian protection is only available in Italy and Slovakia is incorrect. Therefore, the statement that Di Maio is wrong is accurate.

"Joaquim Barbosa said, at this time of the monthly, that I was the only deputy of the allied base of the government who did not take money at Petrobras",half true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the available evidence. Joaquim Barbosa, a former Brazilian politician and judge, made a statement about a specific individual being the only deputy of the government's allied base who did not take money from Petrobras. Without specific names or additional context, it's challenging to verify the claim directly. However, such claims often involve complex investigations and legal proceedings, and it's crucial to rely on official findings and reports.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim and the complexity of such allegations, it's prudent to consider that the statement may contain elements of truth but also requires further verification. Therefore, without additional evidence, the claim can be considered 'Half True.'

Without access to specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, it is generally known that many countries and international organizations have continued to invest in basic sanitation projects as part of broader development and public health initiatives.

Given the ongoing efforts by various governments and organizations to improve sanitation, it is unlikely that there has been no investment at all since 2015. Therefore, the claim might be an overgeneralization.

Without additional context or a specific framework, it's difficult to evaluate the truthfulness of this statement. However, if we interpret ""holiday slicing"" in a literal sense or as a common phrase, it doesn't correspond to any widely recognized hypothesis in academic, scientific, or general knowledge domains. Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly false due to its lack of grounding in known hypotheses.

Italy country of mothers?,half true,it,"The claim 'Italy country of mothers?' is not a factual statement but rather a phrase that seems to be missing context or proper grammar. If it is intended to mean that Italy is known for honoring or having a strong cultural focus on mothers, it is not accurate without specific context. Italy is known for many things, such as its rich history, cuisine, art, and culture, but it is not particularly singled out as the ""country of mothers"" in a way that would make this claim universally true.

And Rio Grande do Sul is the state that has the largest number of suicides in Brazil (...),false,pt,"To evaluate the claim that ""Rio Grande do Sul is the state that has the largest number of suicides in Brazil,"" we need reliable and current data on suicide rates across different states in Brazil.

According to various sources, including government health reports and studies, Rio Grande do Sul has historically had one of the highest suicide rates in Brazil. However, it's essential to note that suicide rates can fluctuate, and the most recent data should be considered.

As of the latest available information, Rio Grande do Sul does indeed have one of the highest suicide rates in the country. While it may not always be the absolute highest in every data set, it consistently ranks among the top states with the most significant suicide issues.

Given this context, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but might not necessarily be the highest in every single year or dataset.

"[PT's management left] a budget break in 2017, of R $ 7 billion",false,pt,"To evaluate the claim that ""PT's management left a budget break in 2017, of R$ 7 billion,"" we need to consider the context and the available data regarding Brazil's budget situation in 2017.

PT (Partido dos Trabalhadores) was in power until 2016 when President Dilma Rousseff was impeached. The claim refers to a ""budget break"" in 2017, which suggests a significant budget deficit or fiscal imbalance.

In 2017, Brazil was indeed facing substantial financial challenges, including a budget deficit. However, attributing a specific figure like R$ 7 billion directly to PT's management is complex due to the ongoing economic conditions and the transition of power.

Without specific data to verify the exact figure of R$ 7 billion, the claim can be considered partially accurate but may oversimplify the broader economic context and the contributions of different political actors.

Porto Alegre had an increase in the number of femicides,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""Porto Alegre had an increase in the number of femicides,"" we would need to examine recent data and statistics on femicides in Porto Alegre. Without access to specific data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to approach this:

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look for reports from local police departments, government agencies, or public safety organizations in Porto Alegre.
2. **Review Media Reports**: Check news articles from reliable sources that may cover trends in femicides.
3. **Consult NGOs and Advocacy Groups**: Organizations focused on women's rights and violence against women often compile data on femicides.

If the data shows a clear upward trend in the number of femicides, the claim would likely be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the data is inconclusive or shows no significant change, it might be 'Half True'. If the data contradicts the claim, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Since I don't have access to the latest data, I can't provide a final answer. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have reviewed the data and found a slight increase in femicides but not a significant one.

However, based on the incomplete information provided, we cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

"He [Márcio França] failed to comply with a judicial measure that determined that the command of the CCP, the Marcola and other leaders were transferred to federal arrests",false,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Source Verification**: Is there a credible source confirming that Márcio França failed to comply with the judicial measure?
2. **Contextual Accuracy**: Were the specific details about the transfer of Marcola and other leaders to federal arrests accurately reported?
3. **Legal Confirmation**: Is there official documentation or legal confirmation that supports the claim?

Without specific details or sources to verify the claim, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if the claim is based on credible reports and official statements, it could be considered true. If there are discrepancies or lack of evidence, the claim might be considered less accurate.

Given the lack of specific context and sources in the provided statement, a reasonable assessment would be that the claim is 'Half True' until further verification can be provided.

The home team always crosses the first phase,mostly true,pt,"To evaluate the claim 'The home team always crosses the first phase', we need to consider the context and the general performance of home teams in various sports and competitions.

In many sports, home teams do have an advantage due to factors like familiarity with the venue, fan support, and reduced travel fatigue. However, asserting that the home team ""always"" crosses the first phase is too absolute. There are numerous instances in sports where the home team does not advance past the initial phase of a competition. Upsets and unexpected outcomes are common in sports, and no team can be guaranteed to always succeed, even with home advantage.

Therefore, the claim is overly broad and does not account for the variability and unpredictability inherent in sports.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
[Brazil has] 52 million [of people] below the poverty line,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim that Brazil has 52 million people below the poverty line, we need reliable and up-to-date data. As of my last update in October 2023, detailed statistics on poverty in Brazil are typically provided by organizations such as the World Bank, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), and other reputable sources.

According to recent reports, Brazil has been facing significant economic challenges, and poverty rates have been on the rise. The exact number of people below the poverty line can vary depending on the definition of poverty used and the specific time frame. However, estimates from reputable sources indicate that the number of people living in poverty in Brazil is indeed substantial, often cited in the tens of millions.

Given the available data and the context of recent economic trends in Brazil, the claim that there are 52 million people below the poverty line is plausible but should be verified with the most current and specific data. Without access to the exact figures from the latest reports, I would rate this claim as ""Mostly True"" based on the general trend and available information.

"Let's create the [Military Police] battalions in Araruama, Nova Iguaçu and Itaguaí",false,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""Let's create the [Military Police] battalions in Araruama, Nova Iguaçu and Itaguaí,"" we need to consider whether there are concrete plans or actions being taken to establish these battalions in the specified locations. Without additional context or evidence, it is difficult to definitively classify the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on a proposal or a plan that has been publicly announced or is under consideration by the relevant authorities, it would likely be classified as 'Mostly True' or 'Half True', depending on the stage of implementation and the level of official commitment.

If there is no official plan or proposal, the claim would lean towards 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Final Answer: Without additional context, it is most appropriately classified as 'Half True'.",,False,True
"In the area of ​​defense and space cooperation, we signed the technology safeguard agreement, which will enable the Alcântara launch center",half true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and facts surrounding the signing of the technology safeguard agreement and its implications for the Alcântara launch center. The technology safeguard agreement (TSA) is a significant step in defense and space cooperation, particularly between the United States and Brazil. This agreement allows the U.S. to use the Alcântara launch center in Brazil for space launches, which is indeed a notable development in space cooperation.

Given the historical and strategic importance of the TSA and its direct relevance to the Alcântara launch center, the claim that the signing of the TSA will enable the use of the Alcântara launch center is accurate.

"""The public market [from Porto Alegre] (...) was closed [during the pandemic]""",half true,pt,"To accurately assess the claim, we need reliable information about the status of the public market in Porto Alegre during the pandemic. Without specific details or a verified source, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge of pandemic measures, many public markets around the world were either temporarily closed or had restricted operations to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

If the claim is that the public market in Porto Alegre was completely closed during the pandemic, and we assume that some form of closure or restriction likely occurred, the claim might be considered 'Mostly True' unless there is evidence to the contrary.

Without additional information, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, if we focus on the general occurrence of anti-racism manifestations in London, it is true that such events have taken place, particularly in recent years, such as the Black Lives Matter protests. Therefore, the claim that there were anti-racism manifestations in London is accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
It does not have a law to combat corruption that has not been passed on the PT government.,half true,pt,"The claim ""It does not have a law to combat corruption that has not been passed on the PT government"" is quite complex and requires contextual understanding. However, based on the phrasing, it seems to imply that all laws to combat corruption have been passed during the PT (Partido dos Trabalhadores) government. This is a strong claim and likely overstates the reality, as various governments over time have enacted laws to combat corruption.

"We bought 35,000 bulletproof vests, the best vests available in the world, international auction",false,pt,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we would need to verify the following points:

1. Whether 35,000 bulletproof vests were indeed purchased.
2. If the vests are of the best quality available in the world.
3. If the purchase was made through an international auction.

Without specific evidence or sources to corroborate these points, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, or false. Therefore, based on the lack of verifiable information, the most accurate assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Brazil already has 100 million cases [in court],half true,pt,"To evaluate the claim that ""Brazil already has 100 million cases [in court],"" we need to consider the context and available data. Brazil does have a significant backlog of legal cases, but the specific number of 100 million cases is a very large figure that warrants verification.

As of my last update in October 2023, while Brazil's judicial system is indeed known for its heavy caseload, the exact number of pending cases is typically in the tens of millions rather than 100 million. For example, in recent years, the number of pending cases has been reported to be around 80 million.

Given this information, the claim that Brazil has 100 million cases in court is likely an exaggeration but not entirely false, as the number is indeed very high. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

However, if we assume it refers to a specific person or entity widely recognized as such, we can make an educated guess.

If the claim refers to a figure like Karl Marx, who is often credited with being a significant educator of the working class through his writings and theories, then the claim could be considered accurate.

Italians in Germany: no circular with threats of expulsion,false,it,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim ""Italians in Germany: no circular with threats of expulsion,"" I would need to review specific evidence or sources that either support or refute this statement. Without such information, I cannot accurately assess the claim. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate it:

1. **Research Official Statements**: Look for any official statements from German authorities or Italian embassies regarding the treatment of Italians in Germany.
2. **Check News Reports**: Review news articles from reputable sources to see if there have been any reports of such a circular.
3. **Government Publications**: Check for any government publications or official documents that might mention such a policy.

1. **Photo Censorship in 2015**: The claim that a photo was censored by Facebook in 2015 for denigrating the image of President Dilma is specific and potentially verifiable, but it lacks supporting evidence in the provided text.

2. **Palocci's Denunciation**: The claim refers to allegations by Antonio Palocci, a former Brazilian politician, which suggest ties between drug trafficking and campaign funding for communist politicians. This part is more complex and would require verification of Palocci's statements and any legal or investigative findings supporting these claims.

3. **Reposting the Photo**: The claim implies that reposting the photo now, with Palocci's allegations, might lead to censorship by ""communist censorship."" This is speculative and not supported by concrete evidence in the text.

Given the lack of specific, verifiable evidence for the censorship claim and the complexity of verifying Palocci's allegations and their implications, the overall claim is not sufficiently supported to be considered true or mostly true.

The female lays 400 eggs,false,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""The female lays 400 eggs,"" we need more context about which species is being referred to. Different species lay different numbers of eggs. For example:

- Some insects, like certain species of butterflies, can lay hundreds of eggs.
- Some fish can lay thousands of eggs.
- Some reptiles and birds lay fewer eggs.

Without this context, it's impossible to accurately categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is about a specific species known to lay around 400 eggs, such as some types of insects, then it could be considered true or mostly true.

If the claim is general and not species-specific, it would be inaccurate because not all females across species lay 400 eggs.

"Bolsonaro fires in the polls, 94% want him to be reelected by 2022",false,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""Bolsonaro fires in the polls, 94% want him to be reelected by 2022,"" we need to consider the reliability of the source, the context of the poll, and the general consensus in public opinion polls regarding Bolsonaro's reelection.

Without specific data or a credible source to back up the claim of 94% support for Bolsonaro's reelection, it is highly unlikely that such a high percentage is accurate. Public opinion polls typically show a range of support for political figures, and a 94% approval rate for reelection is exceptionally high and unusual.

Most reputable polls and political analyses indicate a more mixed response to Bolsonaro's presidency, with approval ratings that are significantly lower than 94%. Therefore, the claim appears to be greatly exaggerated.

Salvini is right on the numbers of the landings,true,it,"To accurately assess the claim ""Salvini is right on the numbers of the landings,"" we would need to verify the specific numbers and statements made by Salvini regarding immigration or other relevant landings. Without access to specific data and context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that Salvini has made claims about the numbers of immigrants or refugees landing in Italy, and we have access to reliable data sources that either corroborate or contradict his statements.

If the numbers presented by Salvini are accurate and align with official records and statistics, the claim would be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the numbers are somewhat accurate but not entirely correct or if there are significant discrepancies, the claim would be 'Half True'. If the numbers are largely inaccurate or misleading, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the hypothetical nature of this response, I cannot provide a definitive answer without specific context. However, for the purpose of completing the request:

**Final Answer: Half True** (assuming some discrepancies or lack of complete accuracy in Salvini's claims).",,False,True
Malta: more Italian presences than German,true,it,"To evaluate the claim ""Malta: more Italian presences than German,"" we need to consider historical, cultural, and demographic factors.

Malta has a strong historical and cultural connection with Italy due to its geographical proximity and shared history, including periods of Italian rule. Italian language and culture have significantly influenced Malta. In contrast, German influence is less pronounced historically and culturally.

However, without specific data on current demographics or cultural influences, it is difficult to make a precise judgment. Generally, it is reasonable to assume that Italian influences are more prevalent than German ones in Malta based on historical and cultural ties.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively say whether the claim is true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, or false.

"According to research institutes, 90% of Rio de Janeiro evangelicals in the second round voted with us",false,pt,"To evaluate the claim that ""90% of Rio de Janeiro evangelicals in the second round voted with us,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Source of Information**: The claim mentions ""research institutes,"" but it does not specify which ones or provide any references for verification.
2. **Specificity and Context**: The claim lacks specific details about the election, the candidates, or the methodology used to determine the voting patterns of evangelicals.
3. **Percentage**: A claim of 90% is quite high and would require robust evidence to support it.

Without specific data or references to back up the claim, it is difficult to ascertain its accuracy. The lack of detailed information and the high percentage claimed without verifiable sources suggest that the claim is likely exaggerated or not fully supported by evidence.

"(...) the number of cases of HIV rises, and the number of [cases of] AIDS falls",true,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""the number of cases of HIV rises, and the number of [cases of] AIDS falls,"" it's important to consider the underlying context and data trends.

1. **HIV Cases**: The number of new HIV infections has been declining globally, thanks to improved prevention efforts, education, and medical interventions. However, the total number of people living with HIV continues to rise due to increased life expectancy with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART).

2. **AIDS Cases**: The number of AIDS cases has been falling due to the widespread use of ART, which helps prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS. People with HIV who are on effective treatment can live long and healthy lives without developing AIDS.

Given these trends, the claim that the number of HIV cases is rising while AIDS cases are falling is generally accurate. However, it's important to note that the rise in HIV cases is primarily due to increased survival rates rather than new infections.

"""For 50 or 60 years there were no new formations in the Argentine Republic""",false,es,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the geological and geographical context of the Argentine Republic. New formations can refer to various geological features such as mountains, valleys, or other landforms. Given that geological processes are typically slow and span millions of years, it is highly unlikely that significant new formations would appear within a 50 to 60-year timeframe.

Therefore, the claim that there were no new formations in the Argentine Republic for 50 or 60 years is likely true, as the timeframe is too short for substantial geological changes to occur.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
We have no floor [salary] of public safety,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""We have no floor of public safety,"" we need more context to determine its accuracy. The term ""floor"" in this context likely refers to a minimum standard or threshold. Without additional information about what specific public safety measures are being referred to or the context in which this statement is made, it is difficult to provide a precise judgment.

However, if we take the claim at face value, it suggests that there is no minimum standard or threshold for public safety. This could be interpreted as a lack of regulations, protocols, or minimum requirements to ensure public safety in a given context.

Given the general nature of the claim and the importance of public safety in most societies, it is likely that some form of public safety standards exists in many areas. Therefore, the claim that there is no floor of public safety is likely not entirely accurate, but without more specific context, it is hard to be definitive.

2. **Specifics**: The amount mentioned is R$ 1.114 trillion, which is said to be 16.8% of GDP.

Without additional context or data to verify the accuracy of the figures, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, assuming the figures are accurate and sourced from reliable official data, the claim seems to be presenting a factual statement.

"Today there is an Italy [...] where the debt has stopped growing, there are one million more employed, the trust of businesses and families is much more solid",true,it,"To accurately assess the claim, we would need to examine recent data on Italy's debt, employment rates, and business and consumer confidence. However, I can provide a framework for evaluating the claim:

1. **Debt Growth**: Check if Italy's public debt has indeed stopped growing. This would require looking at recent economic reports and data from reliable sources like the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) or the European Central Bank.

2. **Employment**: Verify if there has been an increase of one million employed individuals. This can be done by comparing employment figures over a relevant period from sources like ISTAT or Eurostat.

3. **Business and Consumer Confidence**: Assess whether there has been a significant improvement in business and consumer confidence. This information can be found in economic surveys and indices, such as those published by the European Commission or other reputable economic research institutions.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general economic trends and reports, Italy has faced significant economic challenges, including high public debt and fluctuating employment rates. Business and consumer confidence can also be influenced by various factors, including political stability and economic policies.

Given the complexity and variability of these factors, a cautious assessment might be:

However, based on the information provided, the claim mentions a theme of regularization and overcoming the Bossi-Fini law, which was part of the government agreement, and it signals discontinuity with the #contei. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine the exact truth value.

Given the limited information, I can only speculate that the claim might be partially accurate if it reflects a general sentiment or policy direction. However, without concrete evidence or specific details, it's difficult to assign a precise truth value.

Without such data, it's not possible to definitively classify the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

However, based on general knowledge and common statistical patterns, a claim that 75% of young people who are not studying or working are women seems quite high and might be an overestimation. Typically, such disparities, while they can exist, are not usually that pronounced.

While sunlight is beneficial for vitamin D production and overall well-being, excessive exposure can lead to sunburn, skin aging, and an increased risk of skin cancer. Moderation and proper protection, such as sunscreen and protective clothing, are crucial. Therefore, the claim is 'Mostly False'.

"The FDA, the American Remedy Regulation Agency, approved the use of hydroxychloroquine in all patients with COVID-19",false,pt,"The claim that ""The FDA, the American Remedy Regulation Agency, approved the use of hydroxychloroquine in all patients with COVID-19"" is inaccurate. The FDA did issue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine in March 2020, but this authorization was later revoked in June 2020 due to concerns about the drug's effectiveness and safety in treating COVID-19. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

"No, Salvini's salary is not only paid by the Italians",false,it,"To evaluate the claim ""No, Salvini's salary is not only paid by the Italians,"" we need to consider the source of funding for Matteo Salvini's salary as a politician.

Matteo Salvini is a member of the European Parliament, among other roles. As such, a significant portion of his salary is paid by the European Union, which draws its budget from contributions from all member states, not just Italy. Therefore, while Italian taxpayers do contribute to his salary, so do taxpayers from other EU countries.

Given this context, the claim that Salvini's salary is not only paid by the Italians is accurate.

1. **Context and Clarity**: The phrase ""receiving a thief"" is nonsensical and likely a result of incorrect translation or a typographical error. It is unclear what is meant by this phrase.

2. **Verifiability**: The claim that there are 40,000 registered fishermen in Brasilia should be checked against reliable sources. Without specific data, it's difficult to verify this number.

3. **Logical Consistency**: Brasilia is not typically known for its fishing industry due to its inland location. This casts doubt on the high number of registered fishermen.

Given the lack of clarity in the statement and the absence of verifiable data, the claim is likely unfounded.

"(Doria) was violently criticized by an advertisement of Brazilian tourism with women on the beach, clearly encouraging sex tourism",half true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider whether Doria was criticized for an advertisement that clearly encouraged sex tourism. The claim suggests a direct and explicit promotion of sex tourism, which is a serious accusation.

However, without specific details about the advertisement in question, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the criticism or the content of the advertisement. Generally, criticisms related to tourism advertisements often revolve around perceived objectification or stereotyping rather than a clear encouragement of sex tourism.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support the claim that the advertisement ""clearly encouraged sex tourism,"" it is more likely that the criticism was based on perceived implications or stereotypes rather than an explicit promotion of sex tourism.

"I built 3,000 new vacancies in the prison system in these four years",mostly true,pt,"To assess the claim ""I built 3,000 new vacancies in the prison system in these four years,"" we need to consider several factors such as the actual number of new prison cells or vacancies constructed during the specified period and the credibility of the source making the claim. Without specific data or evidence to verify the number, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim.

If there is evidence that supports the claim of 3,000 new vacancies being built, but there might be some minor discrepancies or additional context needed, the claim could be considered ""Mostly True."" If there is significant doubt or contradictory evidence, it might be considered ""Mostly False"" or ""False.""

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim itself, a reasonable assessment without additional context would be:

[Illegal deforestation] rose from 2012 around 37%,mostly true,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""[Illegal deforestation] rose from 2012 around 37%,"" we need to consider the accuracy and specificity of the statement. The claim suggests that illegal deforestation increased by approximately 37% starting from the year 2012. However, without specific data or a source to verify this exact percentage, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Given the lack of specific data to support the exact 37% figure, but acknowledging that illegal deforestation has been a significant and increasing issue in many regions, the claim can be considered partly accurate but not fully verifiable.

As of recent data, the average retirement benefit in the INSS is generally higher than R$ 1.9 thousand. According to official reports from the INSS, the average retirement benefit tends to be closer to R$ 2.5 thousand or more.

Given this discrepancy, the claim that the average retirement benefit is R$ 1.9 thousand is significantly lower than the actual average reported by the INSS.

"The removal of ""emergency use"" by FDA expands the treatment with hydroxychloroquine in the USA",false,pt,"The claim that ""the removal of 'emergency use' by FDA expands the treatment with hydroxychloroquine in the USA"" is not accurate. In fact, the FDA revoked the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for treating COVID-19 on June 15, 2020, due to a lack of evidence of their effectiveness and concerns about serious safety risks. This revocation actually restricts the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, rather than expanding it.

"""The state deputy has $ 40,000 to sponsor his mandate""",true,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""The state deputy has $40,000 to sponsor his mandate,"" we need more context and evidence. Without specific details about the source of the funding, the regulations governing such funding, or any official documentation, it's challenging to verify the claim accurately.

However, based on general knowledge about political funding, it's unlikely that a state deputy would have a fixed amount of $40,000 specifically for sponsoring their mandate without further qualification or context. Political funding can vary widely based on the jurisdiction, the source of the funds, and the specific rules governing the use of such funds.

Given the lack of specific details, the claim appears to be a generalization that may not be universally accurate. Therefore, without additional evidence, the claim could be considered:

1. **Government Setting Aside 2 Billion**: This part of the claim suggests that the government has allocated 2 billion for deficit coverage. This is a factual statement that can be verified through official government announcements or budget documents.

2. **Cuts to Businesses, Transport, and Universities**: This part of the claim indicates that the 2 billion will result in cuts to specific sectors starting from July. The truth of this statement depends on whether there are official plans or announcements outlining these specific cuts.

3. **Public Realization**: The claim mentions that Italians have not yet realized the implications. This is subjective and difficult to quantify without public opinion data.

4. **Commission Making Cuts**: The claim suggests that a commission will make these cuts. This part can be verified if there is an official body or commission tasked with implementing these cuts.

Without specific, verifiable sources, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false. However, based on the structure of the claim and the typical complexity of government budgeting and public awareness, it's likely that some parts of the claim are accurate while others may be speculative or misinterpreted.

- Between March and May 2020, there were 8,185 deaths from respiratory causes.
- The difference is just over a thousand dead.

Let's calculate the difference:

8,185 (2020 deaths) - 7,106 (2019 deaths) = 1,079

The difference is indeed just over a thousand (1,079), which matches the claim.

Therefore, the claim is accurate based on the provided data.

"The left that 'worries' with the death of a child, victim of stray bullet, is the same that promotes abortion tea!",false,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the logical consistency of the positions presented.

1. **Concern for a Child's Death**: The left (generally associated with progressive or liberal political views) often expresses concern for the welfare of children, including those who are victims of violence such as stray bullets.

2. **Promotion of Abortion**: The left also tends to support reproductive rights, including the right to choose abortion.

However, the claim conflates two distinct issues: concern for the life of a child who is already born and support for reproductive rights, including abortion. The positions on these issues are not inherently contradictory, as they address different stages of human development and different contexts of personal autonomy and societal responsibility.

The claim implies that supporting abortion is inconsistent with caring about the death of a child, but this oversimplifies complex ethical and political views. People can simultaneously advocate for reproductive rights and express deep concern for the well-being and safety of children.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the information provided, the statement appears to suggest that a specific proposal followed another event or proposal that involved 95%.

If we assume the ""100%"" proposal is indeed more generous than the ""95%"" one, the claim could be considered true or mostly true. However, without knowing the specific details of the proposals or the context in which they were made, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

1. **True**: If reliable data shows that energy imports indeed do not exceed 8% of the country's total energy demand.
2. **Mostly True**: If the data shows that energy imports are slightly above 8% but still relatively close to this figure.
3. **Half True**: If the data shows that energy imports are significantly above 8% but not drastically so.

Without specific data or context provided in the claim, it's challenging to definitively assess its accuracy. However, we can make some general observations:

1. **Context**: GDP per capita can fluctuate due to various economic factors, including economic growth, population changes, and inflation.
2. **Data Source**: Reliable economic forecasts are typically provided by organizations like the World Bank, IMF, or national statistical agencies.
3. **Historical Trends**: GDP per capita trends can be analyzed to see if a decline of six points (assuming points refer to a percentage or another specific measure) is plausible.

Given the lack of specific data or context in the claim, it's difficult to validate or refute it accurately. Economic forecasts can vary widely based on numerous factors, and without a clear reference point, the claim is speculative.

1. **""In 2009 the H1N1 flu killed a lot more people than Covid19""**: This is false. According to the CDC, the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 is estimated to have caused between 151,700 to 575,400 deaths worldwide. In contrast, COVID-19 has caused significantly more deaths, with the global death toll exceeding several million.

2. **""your Lula administration did not give you 10 cents""**: This statement is vague and subjective, making it difficult to evaluate without specific context. However, it implies that the Lula administration did not provide financial assistance, which may not be accurate without specific evidence.

3. **""the rotten media was silently silent did not speak of isolation, or anything""**: This is mostly false. The media did cover the H1N1 pandemic, and there were recommendations for isolation and other preventive measures, although the response and coverage were different compared to COVID-19.

Given the inaccuracies in the claim, especially regarding the number of deaths and the media coverage, the overall statement is largely false.

We are (...) with record of unemployment,false,pt,"To evaluate the claim ""We are ... with a record of unemployment,"" we need more context. If the claim is suggesting that current unemployment rates are at a record high or low, we would need to compare current data with historical records. Without specific data or context, a general evaluation can't be made accurately.

However, if we assume the claim is about current unemployment rates being at a record level (either high or low), here's a general approach to evaluating such a claim:

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look at data from reputable sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the U.S. or equivalent organizations in other countries.
2. **Compare with Historical Data**: Compare current unemployment rates with historical records to see if they are indeed at a record level.
3. **Consider Recent Trends**: Look at recent trends and economic indicators to understand the context of the claim.

Without specific data, a precise evaluation is challenging. However, based on general knowledge and the need for more context, the claim would likely fall under:

**Final Answer: Half True**

This assessment is based on the assumption that while unemployment rates might be notable, without specific data, we cannot conclusively say whether they are at a record level.",,False,True
The program will benefit 4 million children between 0 and 3 years [until the end of 2018],false,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need more context and data, such as:

1. The current number of children aged 0 to 3 years in the target population.
2. The specific details of the program and its implementation plan.
3. Any existing data or reports on the program's progress and reach.

Without this information, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can give a general guideline on how to approach this:

- If the program is well-documented and on track to reach 4 million children by the end of 2018, the claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the program has reached a significant number of children but is unlikely to meet the 4 million target, it might be 'Half True'.
- If the program is far from reaching the stated number or lacks credible implementation plans, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Since I don't have the specific data to verify the claim, I can't provide a final answer. If you can provide more details or data, I can help you make a more accurate assessment.

Final Answer: [Cannot be determined without additional information]",,False,True
A debt is inadmissible - including banks and large companies (...) - [with] the city of São Paulo that is around R $ 130 million,false,pt,"To evaluate the claim that ""A debt is inadmissible - including banks and large companies (...) - [with] the city of São Paulo that is around R$ 130 million,"" we need to consider the context and the specificity of the information provided.

1. **Specificity**: The claim mentions a specific amount (R$ 130 million) and a specific entity (the city of São Paulo). This level of detail suggests that the claim is referring to a particular situation or incident.

2. **Verifiability**: Without additional context or verification from official sources or documentation, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of the claim. Financial claims, especially those involving large sums and public entities, typically require supporting evidence such as financial statements, audit reports, or official announcements.

3. **Context**: The claim mentions that the debt is ""inadmissible,"" which suggests a legal or financial dispute. Without knowing the legal basis or the outcome of any related proceedings, it is difficult to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Given the lack of verifiable information and the need for more context, the claim cannot be fully substantiated or refuted. Therefore, the most accurate assessment based on the available information is:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
"For 56 years, a violent confrontation between the RDA police forces, and ......",true,pt,"To evaluate the claim accurately, I would need the full context or the complete sentence, particularly the entities involved in the confrontation with the RDA police forces. The claim as it stands is incomplete, making it difficult to assess its veracity.

However, based on the information provided, it is not possible to confirm the truthfulness of the claim without additional details.

(...) Our expectation is that [the membranes and tailings containment curtains installed in Pará de Minas] is enough to contain this tailings and not allow any problem for the river water capture [Paraopeba],false,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the effectiveness and reliability of the membranes and tailings containment curtains mentioned. Without specific data or reports on their performance in the context of Pará de Minas and the Paraopeba River, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, containment measures are generally designed to mitigate risks, but their effectiveness can vary based on numerous factors such as the volume of tailings, the integrity of the containment structures, and environmental conditions.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific data, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as neither entirely true nor entirely false. It acknowledges the intention and design of the containment measures but does not account for potential failures or external factors.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"""In no country in the world a government is governed with an opposition budget""",half true,es,"The claim that ""In no country in the world a government is governed with an opposition budget"" is generally true because governments typically operate based on the budget proposed and approved by the ruling party or coalition. The opposition may propose alternative budgets or amendments, but the final budget is usually a reflection of the government's policies and priorities.

However, there are rare exceptions where a minority government may have to negotiate and incorporate significant opposition demands into the budget to secure its passage. These situations are not the norm and typically occur in parliamentary systems where no single party holds a majority.

Given these considerations, the claim is largely accurate but not absolute.

However, the claim lacks specific details about the donation process, such as how the products will be distributed, who is eligible, and how the company will verify and contact those in need. Without verifiable information or a credible source to corroborate the claim, it is difficult to confirm its authenticity.

"BNDES is available (...) to redirect the resources already approved to the building's reconstruction efforts and, as possible, to restore the collection",mostly true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the specific details of the situation. The claim suggests that BNDES (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social) is available to redirect resources already approved towards the building's reconstruction efforts and, if possible, to restore the collection.

Without additional context or specific evidence, it's challenging to definitively determine the accuracy of this claim. However, if we assume that the statement is made by a reliable source and reflects official policy or intentions of BNDES, it would likely be classified as ""True"" or ""Mostly True.""

With the word the federal judge Marcelo Bretas da Lava Jato Rio de Janeiro.,false,pt,"The claim ""With the word the federal judge Marcelo Bretas da Lava Jato Rio de Janeiro"" is grammatically incorrect and lacks coherence, making it difficult to evaluate its truthfulness. However, if we interpret the claim as suggesting that Marcelo Bretas is a federal judge associated with the Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) in Rio de Janeiro, then we can assess its accuracy.

Marcelo Bretas is indeed a federal judge in Brazil and is known for his involvement in Operation Car Wash (Lava Jato) investigations in Rio de Janeiro. Therefore, the claim, when interpreted in this context, is largely accurate.

"""The mechanism will have a bias towards those who have less""",false,es,"To evaluate the claim ""The mechanism will have a bias towards those who have less,"" we need more context about the specific mechanism being discussed. Without that context, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement. However, if we assume the mechanism is designed to redistribute resources or provide assistance to those in need, the claim could be generally true.

**Analysis:**
- If the mechanism is a social welfare program, progressive tax system, or any form of aid targeted at the less fortunate, it would indeed have a bias towards those who have less.
- If the mechanism is neutral or benefits everyone equally regardless of their economic status, the claim would be false.
- If the mechanism disproportionately benefits those who are already well-off, the claim would be mostly false.

**Final Answer:** Without additional context, a general assumption would be **Half True**, as many mechanisms designed for social good do aim to benefit those with less, but this is not universally true.",,False,True
"In 2013, the agreement between the petista government and the Cuban dictatorship brought to Brazil 10,000 doctors",half true,pt,"The claim that ""In 2013, the agreement between the petista government and the Cuban dictatorship brought to Brazil 10,000 doctors"" is mostly accurate but requires some context for full precision.

In 2013, the Brazilian government, under the Workers' Party (PT) administration led by Dilma Rousseff, did indeed initiate a program called ""Mais Médicos"" (More Doctors) in collaboration with the Cuban government. The program aimed to bring foreign doctors, primarily from Cuba, to work in underserved areas of Brazil. Initially, the agreement was to bring approximately 4,000 Cuban doctors to Brazil, but the number of Cuban doctors participating in the program eventually reached around 11,000.

Given that the initial agreement was for fewer doctors but the actual number eventually exceeded 10,000, the claim is largely accurate but not entirely precise.

2018-11-03T14: 18: 33Z,false,pt,"The claim '2018-11-03T14:18:33Z' appears to be a timestamp in ISO 8601 format, which represents a specific date and time. To evaluate the truthfulness of this claim, we need to consider whether it accurately represents a real moment in time. Since timestamps are generally factual representations of specific points in time, and there is no context provided to suggest this timestamp is incorrect or misleading, it can be considered 'True'.

"Federal Deputy of Psol Talíria Petrone (...) stated in a session in the House of Representatives that 'police officers do no more than obligation to die in combat against organized crime, as they are paid to die'",false,pt,"The statement attributed to Federal Deputy Talíria Petrone suggests that she said police officers are ""paid to die"" in combat against organized crime. This phrasing is quite extreme and unlikely to be an accurate representation of her views, as it implies that police officers are expected to die as part of their job.

To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the exact context and wording of Talíria Petrone's statement. However, based on general principles, it is highly unlikely that a public figure would make such a blunt and insensitive statement. Therefore, without specific evidence to support this exact phrasing, the claim appears to be exaggerated or misrepresented.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Brasilia (...) has police compensation paid by the federal government,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim 'Brasilia (...) has police compensation paid by the federal government,' we need to consider the context of Brazil's governance structure. Brasilia is the federal capital of Brazil, and it operates under a unique administrative framework compared to other cities in the country.

In Brazil, the Federal District (Distrito Federal), which includes Brasilia, has its own police forces, known as the Military Police of the Federal District (Polícia Militar do Distrito Federal) and the Civil Police of the Federal District (Polícia Civil do Distrito Federal). These police forces are under the administrative control of the Federal District government, but they receive funding from the federal government due to Brasilia's status as the national capital.

Given this context, the claim that 'Brasilia (...) has police compensation paid by the federal government' is largely accurate. The federal government plays a significant role in funding the police forces in Brasilia, although the exact details of compensation may vary and involve both federal and local contributions.

Gentiloni inaccurate on industrial production and exports of Italy,half true,it,"To evaluate the claim 'Gentiloni inaccurate on industrial production and exports of Italy,' we need specific data and context regarding Gentiloni's statements and the actual statistics on industrial production and exports of Italy. Without this specific information, it's challenging to provide a precise assessment.

However, if we assume that Gentiloni made claims about industrial production and exports of Italy that contradict widely accepted and verifiable data, the claim could be evaluated as follows:

1. **True**: Gentiloni's statements are completely inaccurate compared to the actual data.
2. **Mostly True**: Gentiloni's statements are largely inaccurate but may contain some elements of truth.
3. **Half True**: Gentiloni's statements are partially accurate and partially inaccurate.
4. **Mostly False**: Gentiloni's statements are largely accurate but may contain some inaccuracies.
5. **False**: Gentiloni's statements are completely accurate and align with the actual data.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, if the claim suggests that Gentiloni's statements are significantly off from the actual data, a reasonable assessment without specific evidence would be 'Half True' to acknowledge the possibility of both truth and inaccuracy.

"""[Between 2010 and 2013] the amount invested in education and health in Brazil was 212 times more than the amount invested in the stadiums""",true,es,"To evaluate the claim that ""the amount invested in education and health in Brazil was 212 times more than the amount invested in the stadiums between 2010 and 2013,"" we need to consider the available data and context.

During the period mentioned, Brazil invested significantly in infrastructure for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The total investment in stadiums and related infrastructure was substantial but was overshadowed by the country's larger investments in education and health.

According to various reports and analyses, while the investments in stadiums were significant, they were indeed dwarfed by the investments in education and health. However, the precise multiplier of 212 times is likely an exaggeration or a misunderstanding of the data.

Given the general trend of government spending and the focus on education and health, it is reasonable to conclude that the investment in these sectors was much higher than in stadiums, but the exact figure of 212 times is likely inaccurate.

A message is being widespread in social networks ......,false,pt,"The claim 'A message is being widespread in social networks' is not specific enough to verify its truth value without additional context.

While it's true that a dog's mouth can contain bacteria that could potentially cause infections in humans, such as Pasteurella and Capnocytophaga canimorsus, the likelihood of serious illness from a dog lick is generally low for most healthy individuals. However, individuals with compromised immune systems, open wounds, or certain medical conditions may be at higher risk.

"‌ ‌ “When we arrived in December we found a languid central bank, without reservations, empty” ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌",false,es,"To evaluate the claim ""When we arrived in December we found a languid central bank, without reservations, empty,"" we need to consider the context and evidence supporting or refuting this statement. Without additional context or specific details, it is challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the phrasing and the general nature of such claims, it seems unlikely that a central bank would be entirely ""empty"" and without any reserves. Central banks typically hold various assets and reserves to manage monetary policy and financial stability.

"""152 thousand registered jobs from the private sector were lost""",true,es,"To determine the veracity of the claim ""152 thousand registered jobs from the private sector were lost,"" we need to review the source of this information and the context in which it was presented. Without specific data or sources, it’s challenging to verify the claim definitively.

However, based on general considerations:

- If the claim is backed by official government reports, economic data, or reliable news sources, it could be considered true or mostly true.
- If the claim lacks proper sourcing or contradicts known data, it could be considered mostly false or false.
- If the claim is partially accurate but misleading or incomplete, it could be considered half true.

Given the lack of specific context or data, I would lean towards caution and suggest that more information is needed for a definitive answer.
