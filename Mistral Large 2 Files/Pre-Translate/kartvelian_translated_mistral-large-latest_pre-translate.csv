Part of the state budget spent did not affect the depreciation of the GEL,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Part of the state budget spent did not affect the depreciation of the GEL,"" we need to consider the context and the specific details provided. However, without additional context or data, it is challenging to definitively determine the accuracy of this claim.

Generally, state budget spending can have various effects on a country's currency, depending on numerous factors such as economic policies, international trade, monetary policies, and external economic conditions. Without specific information on the economic context, the amount spent, and the corresponding economic indicators, it is difficult to precisely judge the claim.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim appears to be a general statement that may not fully capture the complexity of the issue. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
"25,000 invalid ballots were not recorded in Adjara",false,ka,"To accurately assess the claim '25,000 invalid ballots were not recorded in Adjara', additional context and verification are essential. Without further information, such as official statements, reports from election authorities, or corroborating evidence, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim.

However, if we assume the claim lacks substantiation or contradicts available evidence, it would lean towards being inaccurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False.",mostly false,False,False
"Against Rustavi 2 we saw illegal, coordinated actions of two branches - court and public ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the evidence supporting or refuting the allegation of illegal, coordinated actions between the court and the public against Rustavi 2. Without specific details or evidence, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, claims of coordinated illegal actions by government branches typically require substantial proof.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim itself, it is difficult to assert its complete truthfulness or falsehood. Therefore, the most balanced assessment would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
"“During court disputes, when the business and the state dispute each other, 99% of the state of state ...",mostly false,ka,"The claim ""During court disputes, when the business and the state dispute each other, 99% of the state of state ..."" is incomplete and lacking context, making it difficult to evaluate its truthfulness accurately. However, based on the available information, the claim appears to be overly generalized and lacks specific data or evidence to support such a high percentage.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
"In Kutaisi, the least in the percentage, the least people are running in the elections",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""In Kutaisi, the least in the percentage, the least people are running in the elections,"" we need more context and specific data about the number of candidates running in Kutaisi compared to other regions or cities. Without such data, it is challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, based on the phrasing alone, the statement seems to suggest that Kutaisi has the lowest percentage of people running in the elections compared to other areas. If there is no evidence or data to support this claim, it would be considered unverified and potentially misleading.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Until 2021 for political officials limited salaries,mostly false,ka,"The claim ""Until 2021 for political officials limited salaries"" is quite vague and could be interpreted in multiple ways. To accurately assess its truthfulness, more specific details are needed, such as which political officials and in what context their salaries were limited. Without additional context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, based on the general understanding that salary limitations for political officials can vary widely by country and specific circumstances, and without specific evidence supporting a universal limitation until 2021, a reasonable assessment might be that the claim is not entirely accurate without further context.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
“The Ministry of Education has been holding the elections of directors for 2 years.80%of schools of the schools are one ...,mostly true,ka,"The claim states that the Ministry of Education has been holding the elections of directors for 2 years and that 80% of schools are involved in this process. However, the claim is incomplete and lacks sufficient context or evidence to verify its accuracy.

Without additional information about the specific country, the Ministry of Education's policies, or the actual percentage of schools involved in director elections, it is impossible to determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"In 2004-2012, the GDP of the agrarian sector was decreasing at constant prices, with an average of 1.2%, during our period ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we need to examine the trends in the GDP of the agrarian sector from 2004 to 2012. The claim states that the GDP of the agrarian sector was decreasing at constant prices with an average of 1.2% annually during this period.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, the general economic trends and available data can provide some context. If the agrarian sector's GDP indeed decreased consistently by about 1.2% annually at constant prices over the specified period, the claim would be accurate. However, if the data shows fluctuations or inconsistencies in this trend, the claim might need to be adjusted.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as potentially accurate but requiring verification with actual data.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"Teachers were promising to raise salaries and only 250 out of about 60,000 teachers increased the tree ...",half true,ka,"The claim states that only 250 out of about 60,000 teachers received a salary increase, which implies a very small proportion (approximately 0.42%) of teachers benefited from the promise. To evaluate this claim, we would need to verify the actual number of teachers who received a salary increase and compare it to the total number of teachers.

However, without additional context or data to support the claim, it's challenging to determine its accuracy definitively. The phrasing 'only 250' suggests a stark contrast, which could be misleading if the actual number is significantly higher or if the context is misrepresented.

Given the lack of verifiable information, the claim appears to be presented in a way that could be misleading without further context. Therefore, a cautious evaluation would be:

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"“The number of employees was reduced from 525 thousand to 480 thousand, from October to April ...",false,ka,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to compare the initial and final numbers of employees:

- Initial number of employees: 525,000
- Final number of employees: 480,000

The reduction in the number of employees is calculated as follows:
\[ 525,000 - 480,000 = 45,000 \]

This means there was a reduction of 45,000 employees from October to April.

Since the claim states that the number of employees was reduced from 525,000 to 480,000, and the calculation confirms this reduction, the claim is accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
The Ministry of Infrastructure is unable to absorb 50%of the budget.Unalcuted in a high -speed car ...,mostly true,ka,"The statement provided is incomplete and lacks context, making it difficult to assess its truthfulness accurately. However, based on the information available, it seems to suggest that the Ministry of Infrastructure is unable to utilize 50% of its budget. Without additional details, such as the specific circumstances or the source of the claim, it is challenging to determine its veracity.

Given the lack of context and the incomplete nature of the statement, a cautious assessment would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
We have significant progress in agriculture,false,ka,"The claim 'We have significant progress in agriculture' is quite broad and can vary greatly depending on the specific context, region, and timeframe being referred to. However, generally speaking, there have been notable advancements in agriculture globally, such as increases in crop yields, improvements in farming technology, and the development of more sustainable practices.

Given these advancements, while acknowledging that challenges and disparities still exist, it would be fair to categorize this claim as:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"""Studies show that for the first time in these years the confidence in the police has fallen.""",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Studies show that for the first time in these years the confidence in the police has fallen,"" we need to consider the context and available data. Without specific studies cited or dates provided, it's difficult to verify the claim accurately. However, general trends and available surveys can give us some insights.

Recent surveys and studies, such as those conducted by Gallup, have shown varying levels of confidence in the police, with some indications of declining trust in recent years. However, without specific references, it's challenging to say this is the ""first time in these years.""

Given the lack of specificity and the need for more context, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not fully verifiable.

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,True,False
"In order to mitigate foreign shocks, the government has reduced the 2014 budget deficit",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""In order to mitigate foreign shocks, the government has reduced the 2014 budget deficit,"" we need more context and specific information about the government in question, the year 2014, and the measures taken to reduce the budget deficit. Without such details, it's challenging to ascertain the accuracy of the claim.

However, generally speaking, reducing a budget deficit can be a strategy to mitigate the impact of foreign shocks by improving a country's fiscal health and reducing its reliance on external borrowing. This can make the economy more resilient to external economic pressures.

Given the lack of specific information, the claim could be considered plausible but not definitively verifiable. Therefore, a reasonable assessment without additional context would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Everyone [alien] can buy land plots, without any restriction",mostly false,ka,"The claim that ""Everyone [alien] can buy land plots, without any restriction"" is not accurate. In most jurisdictions, there are restrictions on who can buy land, and these restrictions often apply to foreigners or non-residents. Therefore, the claim is false.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"Today, according to the states specified in the state budget, 11 thousand more officials serve ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the current number of officials compared to the number specified in the state budget. Without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to approach this:

1. **Check the State Budget**: Verify the number of officials specified in the state budget.
2. **Current Number of Officials**: Determine the current number of officials serving.
3. **Comparison**: Compare the current number to the number specified in the state budget to see if there is an increase of 11 thousand officials.

If the data supports the claim that there are 11 thousand more officials serving today compared to the number specified in the state budget, then the claim is 'True'. If the data partially supports the claim, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the data shows a significant discrepancy, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

**Final Answer:** Without specific data, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the need for verification, I would tentatively say 'Half True' until further information is provided.",,False,True
"“As a result of competitions in public sector until January 2014, 85%of public servants service ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, I would need more context and specific data regarding competitions in the public sector and the percentage of public servants in service until January 2014. Without additional information, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the statement. However, based on the general structure and common sense, such a high percentage (85%) seems unlikely to be solely the result of competitions, as public sector hiring typically involves a mix of methods including direct appointments, promotions, and competitions.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,True,False
"""You have been convicted of 300,000 people in 9 years""",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""You have been convicted of 300,000 people in 9 years,"" we need more context and specific details. Without additional information, such as the identity of the individual or entity being referred to, the jurisdiction, and the nature of the convictions, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

However, based on general knowledge, convicting 300,000 people in 9 years is an extremely high number and would be highly unusual for any single individual or entity. This claim seems exaggerated and unlikely to be true without substantial evidence.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Sagarejo has been in the city for 5 years, but there is no water ... People have been watching since 2015 ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Sagarejo has been in the city for 5 years, but there is no water ... People have been watching since 2015 ..."", we need more context and specific information about the situation in Sagarejo. Without additional details such as official reports, testimonials, or data from reliable sources, it is challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, based on the general structure of the statement, it suggests a persistent issue with water supply in Sagarejo since at least 2015. If there is evidence that Sagarejo has had water supply issues for the mentioned period, the claim could be valid.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
"37% was approximately state debt and today is 44%, with a major role in the exchange role in that",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at the specifics provided:

1. The claim states that 37% was approximately the state debt at some point in the past.
2. The claim also states that today the state debt is 44%.
3. It suggests that the exchange rate played a major role in this increase.

Without additional context or specific data, it's challenging to verify the exact percentages and the role of the exchange rate. However, assuming the percentages are accurate and there is evidence that the exchange rate contributed significantly to the increase in state debt, the claim could be considered mostly true.

If the percentages are accurate but the role of the exchange rate is exaggerated or unsupported, the claim would be half true.

If the percentages are inaccurate or the role of the exchange rate is completely false, the claim would be mostly false or false.

Given the information provided, a reasonable assessment without additional context would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
"“According to Article 12 of the Law on Legal Entity of Public Law, today the universities are firm ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim “According to Article 12 of the Law on Legal Entity of Public Law, today the universities are firm ...,” we need to consider the specific context and wording of Article 12 of the mentioned law. Without the full text of Article 12, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general legal principles and typical language used in legal documents, the claim could be interpreted in various ways.

If the claim accurately reflects the content of Article 12, it would be true. However, if the claim is a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of the article, it would be false. Without additional context or the actual text of Article 12, a precise evaluation is not possible.

Given the ambiguity and lack of specific details, the claim is likely 'Half True' at best, as it may partially reflect the content of the law but could also be misleading or incomplete.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Electric transport appears in Batumi for the first time not only in the region, but perhaps the whole post -Soviet Siv ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the historical context and the introduction of electric transport in Batumi and the broader post-Soviet space.

Batumi, located in Georgia, has seen developments in electric transport in recent years. However, the claim that electric transport appeared in Batumi for the first time not only in the region but perhaps the whole post-Soviet space is quite strong and requires validation with historical data.

Electric transport, such as electric buses and trams, has been introduced in various post-Soviet countries over the past few decades. For instance, electric buses have been in operation in cities like Moscow and Saint Petersburg in Russia, as well as in other post-Soviet states like Ukraine and Belarus.

Without specific evidence that Batumi was indeed the first to introduce electric transport in the entire post-Soviet space, the claim seems exaggerated. The introduction of electric transport in Batumi is significant, but it is unlikely to be the very first instance in the entire region.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but may contain some truth regarding the significance of electric transport in Batumi.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Despite increased health funding, poverty increased in 2017 ... Citizens of Health Knife ...",mostly true,ka,"The claim ""Despite increased health funding, poverty increased in 2017 ... Citizens of Health Knife ..."" appears to be incomplete and lacks sufficient context to determine its accuracy. Without additional information about the specifics of health funding, poverty metrics, and the context of ""Citizens of Health Knife,"" it is difficult to make a precise determination.

However, based on the general structure of the claim, it suggests a correlation between increased health funding and an increase in poverty, which might imply a paradox. Without specific data to support or refute this claim, it is challenging to assign a definitive truth value.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"There are 60 streets in Gori for six years, with another 25 streets this year will be added",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:
1. There were 60 streets in Gori for six years.
2. Another 25 streets will be added this year.

Without specific data or context about the city of Gori and its urban development plans, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of these statements. However, the claim combines a historical fact (the number of streets over the past six years) with a future prediction (the addition of 25 streets this year).

Given the lack of verifiable information, the claim cannot be fully substantiated. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The 2017 FDI is recorded in the history of independent Georgia,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim 'The 2017 FDI is recorded in the history of independent Georgia,' we need to consider the context and specific details surrounding Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Georgia in 2017. Without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide an absolute answer. However, if the claim is referring to a notable event or record-breaking FDI in Georgia's history, we would need to verify this with reliable sources.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume that 2017 saw a significant increase or notable event in FDI for Georgia. If this is the case, the claim could be considered mostly true, as it highlights a significant moment in the country's economic history. However, without concrete data, we can't confirm it as entirely true.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"""14,000 convicts are out of jail and there is no resocialization program""",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""14,000 convicts are out of jail and there is no resocialization program,"" we need to consider two main points: the number of convicts released and the availability of resocialization programs.

1. **Number of Convicts Released:** Verifying the exact number of convicts released would require specific data from a reliable source, such as government records or official reports. Without this data, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the ""14,000 convicts"" figure.

2. **Availability of Resocialization Programs:** This part of the claim suggests that there are no resocialization programs at all. In most jurisdictions, there are typically some forms of resocialization programs in place, even if they may be insufficient or not widely available. Completely lacking any resocialization programs is highly unlikely.

Given these considerations, the claim that ""14,000 convicts are out of jail and there is no resocialization program"" is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual situation.

**Final Answer:** Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Since 2013, we have been able to provide more than 16,000 IDP family housing, 5 0 of them ...",half true,ka,"The statement 'Since 2013, we have been able to provide more than 16,000 IDP family housing, 5 0 of them ...' is incomplete and lacks context, making it impossible to verify its accuracy. Without additional information, such as the total number of IDP families housed or the specific details of the '5 0 of them', the claim cannot be accurately assessed.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
In all villages of Gori municipality there is a problem of irrigation water,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""In all villages of Gori municipality there is a problem of irrigation water,"" we would need specific data on the irrigation water conditions in each village within the Gori municipality. Without such data, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the absolute nature of the statement (""all villages""), it is unlikely that every single village faces irrigation water problems. Therefore, a more cautious assessment would be appropriate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
14 million from Poti's 15 million budget only to salaries and different costs,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""'14 million from Poti's 15 million budget only to salaries and different costs,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Context**: Understand the context in which the budget is being discussed. Is this an annual budget, a project budget, or something else?
2. **Verification**: Check if there are official sources or documents that confirm the budget allocation.
3. **Proportionality**: Assess whether allocating 14 million out of 15 million to salaries and other costs is reasonable or typical for the given context.

Without specific details or official verification, it's challenging to definitively label the claim. However, allocating nearly the entire budget to salaries and costs is unusual and would generally raise questions about the efficiency and sustainability of the budgeting process.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
"“No matter how the defendant wanted to discuss his case to jury, the prosecutor every month ...",false,ka,"The claim suggests that the prosecutor interfered with the defendant's ability to discuss his case with the jury every month. Without additional context or evidence, it's impossible to definitively determine the truthfulness of this claim. However, in general, such interference would be a violation of the defendant's right to a fair trial. Based on the principle that a defendant should have the opportunity to present their case, the claim as stated is likely exaggerated or inaccurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"“According to European, American experience, the head of administration is limited to have an academic…",mostly false,ka,"The claim that ""According to European, American experience, the head of administration is limited to have an academic..."" is quite vague and could be interpreted in multiple ways. However, generally speaking, there is no universal requirement in Europe or America that the head of administration must have an academic background. While many leaders do have academic degrees, it is not a strict limitation or requirement. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
"In the first quarter of 2017, Georgian exports to the EU increased by 44%",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""In the first quarter of 2017, Georgian exports to the EU increased by 44%,"" we need to consider the reliability of the source and any available data to corroborate this statement. Without specific data at hand, I can provide a general approach to assessing such claims.

1. **Source Reliability**: Check if the claim comes from a reputable source such as an official government report, a recognized economic research institution, or a reliable news outlet.
2. **Data Verification**: Cross-reference the claim with official trade statistics from authoritative bodies like the Georgian National Statistics Office or the European Union's statistical office (Eurostat).
3. **Contextual Analysis**: Consider any contextual factors that might affect export figures, such as economic policies, trade agreements, or global market conditions.

Given that I don't have access to real-time data or specific sources, I can't definitively verify the claim. However, if the claim is backed by official statistics and reputable sources, it would likely be considered accurate.

**Final Answer: Mostly True** (assuming it aligns with reliable sources and data).",,False,True
Georgia has high economic growth rates compared to the region and the EU,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Georgia has high economic growth rates compared to the region and the EU,"" we need to consider recent economic data and trends.

As of recent years, Georgia has shown notable economic growth. According to various sources, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Georgia has had one of the highest economic growth rates in the region (Caucasus and Eastern Europe) and has often outpaced the average growth rates in the European Union (EU).

For example, in 2019, Georgia's GDP growth rate was around 5%, which was higher than the average growth rate in the EU and many of its regional neighbors. While the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 affected economic growth globally, including in Georgia, the country has shown resilience and has been projected to return to positive growth rates.

Given this context, the claim can be considered mostly accurate, though it's important to note that economic growth rates can fluctuate and comparisons may vary depending on the specific timeframe and sources used.

Tens of thousands of teachers and pensioners are less than dollar than in 2012,mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, ""Tens of thousands of teachers and pensioners are less than dollar than in 2012,"" we need to consider the context and any available data that supports or refutes the statement.

However, without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. The statement is vague and could be interpreted in various ways. For example, it could refer to income levels, benefits, or purchasing power.

Given the lack of specific information and the ambiguity of the claim, it is difficult to categorize it as entirely true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
No international assessment has been discussed in court corruption,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""No international assessment has been discussed in court corruption,"" additional context is needed. However, based on the information provided, the claim seems to be making a definitive statement without any qualifiers or context. Without further details or evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy.

If the claim is meant to assert that there has been no discussion in any court regarding international assessments of corruption, it would require comprehensive knowledge of all court proceedings worldwide, which is practically infeasible. Therefore, without specific evidence or context, the claim seems overly broad and likely unverifiable.

Given the lack of specificity and the broad nature of the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that it is not entirely accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
We were building a large airport in Guria ... we started construction,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""We were building a large airport in Guria ... we started construction,"" we need to consider whether there is evidence that such a project was initiated and whether significant construction had begun. Without specific details or context, it is difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, if there is some evidence of initial construction work but no substantial progress, the claim might be considered partially accurate.

Given the lack of specific information in the claim, a reasonable assessment might be that some construction may have started but the extent of the work is unclear. Therefore, the claim could be categorized as:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False

Without additional details, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the statement.

However, based on general knowledge, it is unlikely that Georgia is the only country to receive positive or notable international ratings in recent periods, given the diversity of countries and the various international ratings that exist.

Without access to such evidence, it is impossible to accurately classify the claim.

However, since I don't have the ability to access external information or verify specific claims in real-time, I cannot provide a definitive answer. If this were a hypothetical exercise, I would need more context or evidence to make an informed judgment.

Georgia has missed the chance to participate in the North-South International Highway project,false,ka,"To determine the veracity of the claim ""Georgia has missed the chance to participate in the North-South International Highway project,"" we need to examine recent developments and official statements regarding Georgia's involvement in the project.

The North-South International Transport Corridor is a significant multimodal trade route connecting India, Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, and Europe. Georgia's participation is crucial due to its strategic location.

As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or official confirmation that Georgia has definitively missed the chance to participate in this project. Georgia has been actively involved in discussions and planning related to the corridor. However, geopolitical tensions and regional dynamics can influence such projects.

Without specific, up-to-date information confirming Georgia's exclusion or missed opportunity, the claim appears to be speculative or based on incomplete information.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
"""This is not the decriminalization of the law ... the criminal responsibility remains""",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the statement:

- ""This is not the decriminalization of the law ...""
- ""... the criminal responsibility remains""

The claim suggests that while there might be some changes or amendments to a law, it does not amount to full decriminalization because criminal responsibility still exists.

Without specific context or details about the law in question, we can infer the following:

1. **Decriminalization**: This typically means that an act is no longer considered a criminal offense.
2. **Criminal Responsibility Remains**: This indicates that while there might be changes to penalties or how the law is enforced, the act still carries legal consequences.

Given these points, the statement is logically consistent. It acknowledges that the law might be altered in some way, but it does not go as far as to remove the criminal status entirely.

**Final Answer: Mostly True**",mostly true,False,False
"500 IDPs House, & Nbsp; which was built by the previous government, Sozar Subari re -repaired",mostly false,ka,"The claim states that a housing project for 500 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), which was built by the previous government, was re-repaired by Sozar Subari. To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Construction by Previous Government**: Was the housing project indeed built by the previous government?
2. **Re-repair by Sozar Subari**: Did Sozar Subari actually re-repair the housing project?

Without specific details or evidence to verify these points, we cannot definitively conclude the truthfulness of the claim. However, the claim suggests that both actions (construction and re-repair) occurred, but it does not provide enough context or verification to determine the accuracy of each part.

Given the information provided, the claim could be considered 'Half True' because it mentions two distinct actions (construction and re-repair) by different entities, but lacks sufficient detail to confirm both parts fully.

Has doubled the volume of foreign direct investments compared to 2012,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Has doubled the volume of foreign direct investments compared to 2012,"" we would need to examine specific data on foreign direct investments (FDI) for the relevant years. Since I don't have real-time access to external databases or specific data points, I'll outline the process for evaluating such a claim:

1. **Identify the Source**: Check the source of the claim to see if it is from a reputable organization or individual.
2. **Review Official Data**: Look at official reports from organizations like the World Bank, IMF, or national statistical agencies that track FDI.
3. **Compare the Figures**: Compare the FDI figures for the year in question to those of 2012.
4. **Assess the Trend**: Determine if the FDI has indeed doubled or if the increase is significant enough to be considered a doubling.

Without specific data, we cannot accurately assess the claim. However, based on typical evaluation criteria:

- **True**: The FDI has exactly doubled.
- **Mostly True**: The FDI has nearly doubled but not exactly.
- **Half True**: The FDI has increased significantly but not close to doubling.
- **Mostly False**: The FDI has increased but not substantially.
- **False**: The FDI has not increased at all or has decreased.

The claim states that the budget of the Ministry of Culture has increased to 128 million, but it does not specify the currency, the time period, or the context of the increase. Additionally, the claim mentions a problem with Vardzia in December, but it is incomplete and lacks details.

Without additional information or sources to verify the increase in the budget and the issues with Vardzia, it is difficult to assess the claim's accuracy. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is incomplete and lacks sufficient details for a precise evaluation.

"""When crossing the state border illegally, two different modes are established""",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""When crossing the state border illegally, two different modes are established,"" we need to consider the context and typical procedures related to border crossings.

Illegal border crossings generally involve evading detection and do not typically establish any formal ""modes"" recognized by authorities. Legal border crossings, on the other hand, may involve different modes of entry such as land, air, or sea, but these are officially recognized and documented.

Given that illegal border crossings are by definition unauthorized and often clandestine, the claim that two different modes are ""established"" seems misleading. The term ""established"" implies a formal or recognized process, which is not the case with illegal crossings.

Without specific details about the incident and which international organizations have made statements, it is impossible to definitively determine the truthfulness of this claim. However, the claim includes a broad generalization that ""all international organizations confirm"" the legitimacy of the use of force, which is highly unlikely. International organizations often have varied perspectives and may not unanimously agree on such a contentious issue.

Given the lack of specific details and the improbability of unanimous agreement among all international organizations, the claim is likely exaggerated or misleading.

Without specific details about these actions, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if there is evidence that the MIA handled the accused differently in these two incidents, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True.' If the evidence is mixed or inconclusive, it might be 'Half True.' If there is no significant difference in the MIA's approach, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and reliable sources indicating that the government has indeed suspended these projects, then the claim could be considered true or mostly true.

1. Whether Tbilisi City Hall has indeed started selling land through electronic auctions.
2. Whether Vazisubani is involved in resurrecting these electronic auctions.

Without specific evidence or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the general structure of the claim and the assumption that it might be referencing recent developments, we can make a reasonable assessment.

If Tbilisi City Hall has indeed started using electronic auctions for land sales and Vazisubani has played a role in this process, the claim could be considered mostly true. If there are significant inaccuracies or misrepresentations in the claim, it would lean towards mostly false or false.

Given the lack of specific details, a balanced approach would be to label it as ""Half True"" unless more definitive information is provided.

"With the budget of 2017, the funding of infrastructure projects in Khelvachauri is reduced",false,ka,"To verify the claim ""With the budget of 2017, the funding of infrastructure projects in Khelvachauri is reduced,"" we would need to examine the official budget documents and reports for the year 2017, specifically focusing on the allocations for infrastructure projects in Khelvachauri.

Without access to those documents, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that you have provided the necessary data or context that supports the claim.

If the data shows a clear reduction in funding for infrastructure projects in Khelvachauri in the 2017 budget compared to previous years, then the claim would be considered true. If the data shows only a minor reduction or a mixed picture, it might be considered mostly true or half true. If the data shows no reduction or an increase in funding, the claim would be mostly false or false.

Since I don't have the actual data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the hypothetical scenario where the data supports the claim:

1. Whether the Constitutional Commission completed its work with zero results.
2. Whether the cost associated with the commission's work is approximately 300 thousand GEL.

Without specific information on the outcomes of the Constitutional Commission's work and the exact cost, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, such claims often involve some degree of subjectivity and interpretation.

If the commission produced any reports, recommendations, or other outputs, regardless of their perceived effectiveness, it would not be accurate to say they completed their work with ""zero results."" Similarly, the cost of 300 thousand GEL needs to be verified through official financial records or reports.

Given the lack of specific details and the potential for subjective interpretation, the claim could be considered 'Half True' if there were some results, even if deemed insignificant, and the cost is roughly accurate.

"""None of the Ministers (after October 1, 2012) have changed the car""",mostly true,ka,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim ""None of the Ministers (after October 1, 2012) have changed the car,"" we would need access to specific data or records that track the car usage of ministers after the given date. Since I do not have real-time access to such data, I cannot verify the claim directly.

However, based on general knowledge and the nature of such claims, it is highly unlikely that no ministers have changed their cars in over a decade. Government officials often upgrade their vehicles for various reasons, including security, maintenance, and changes in their roles or positions.

Therefore, without specific evidence to support the claim, it is reasonable to assume that the claim is likely 'False'.

The claim mentions an event in 2012 where 10 people were arrested. However, the context and specific details are not provided, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim without additional information.

Based on the available information, it is not possible to determine the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, the claim is considered 'Half True' as it lacks sufficient details for a complete verification.

Different European countries have varying regulations regarding the length of pre-election periods, and some may indeed have periods longer than three months.

Without this context, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume the claim is verifiable and has been fact-checked by a reliable source. If the source confirms that more than 300 public officials have indeed been charged in previous years, the claim would be considered accurate.

"Since 2012, the number of cars in Tbilisi has increased 2.5 times.This without increasing revenue ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""Since 2012, the number of cars in Tbilisi has increased 2.5 times. This without increasing revenue..."", we need to consider two main points: the increase in the number of cars and the impact on revenue.

1. **Increase in the Number of Cars**:
   - To verify this, we would need access to official statistics or reports from credible sources that track vehicle registrations or the number of cars in Tbilisi. If such data shows that the number of cars has indeed increased by 2.5 times since 2012, this part of the claim would be accurate.

2. **Impact on Revenue**:
   - The claim suggests that this increase in the number of cars has not led to an increase in revenue. To verify this, we would need to look at revenue data from relevant sources, such as municipal budgets, tax revenues from vehicle registrations, or other related financial reports. If the data shows that revenue has not increased despite the rise in the number of cars, this part of the claim would also be accurate.

Given that we do not have direct access to the specific data mentioned, we can only speculate based on general economic principles and available information. Typically, an increase in the number of cars could lead to increased revenue through various means such as registration fees, road taxes, fuel taxes, and other related revenues. However, if there are offsetting factors such as changes in tax policies, economic downturns, or shifts in revenue generation mechanisms, it is possible that revenue might not increase proportionally.

Without specific data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general understanding that an increase in the number of cars would typically lead to some form of increased revenue, the claim that revenue has not increased despite a 2.5 times increase in the number of cars seems questionable.

As of my last update in October 2023, the penalties for personal use of cannabis in France are less severe. Typically, the use of cannabis can result in a fine of up to €200, and possession can lead to penalties including fines and potential imprisonment, but not to the extent of 10 years or a fine of 7.5 million euros.

As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific information provided about which country is entering into a Free Trade Zone Agreement with the EU on September 1. Without this context, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the claim.

"“The poor situation in the economy is contagious to other areas.For example, the holy profits of the railway ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the general economic principle that economic downturns can indeed affect various sectors, including transportation like railways. However, the phrase ""holy profits"" seems to be a typo or misinterpretation, likely intended to be ""whole profits"" or simply ""profits.""

The claim suggests that a poor economy can negatively impact the railway sector, which is generally true. Economic downturns often lead to reduced demand for transportation services, which can affect the profitability of railways.

Considering the general economic principle and the likely intended meaning of the claim, the statement is mostly accurate but contains a minor error or ambiguity with the phrase ""holy profits.""

However, based on the structure of the claim, it appears to be comparing the accomplishments of two different entities or periods within a very short time frame.

If the statement is factually supported by evidence showing that significant progress was made in a shorter time compared to a longer period of inaction or lesser progress, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. Conversely, if the comparison is exaggerated or unfounded, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data or records of his legislative activities, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, claims that categorically state a politician did not comply with any legislative initiatives are often subject to scrutiny, as even minimal involvement can contradict such a strong assertion.

If there is documented evidence indicating that the project was planned to be completed by the end of 2015, then the claim would be supported.

However, without specific context or sources provided, it is challenging to definitively state the accuracy of the claim. Generally, claims about project completion dates should be verified through official documents, project reports, or statements from relevant authorities.

The statement contains a grammatical error (""mosters"" should likely be ""teachers"" or ""students"") and lacks specific context or data to verify the claim about the Ministry of Education doubling in some capacity. Without additional information or a clear metric to evaluate (e.g., budget, number of students, number of teachers), it's impossible to accurately assess the truthfulness of the claim.

Given the lack of clarity and the grammatical error, the claim is ambiguous and cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the provided information.

Virtually all ministries salary is reduced,mostly true,ka,"To accurately evaluate the claim ""Virtually all ministries salary is reduced,"" I would need specific context and data regarding the salary reductions in the ministries in question. However, based on the phrasing ""virtually all,"" which implies a very high percentage but not necessarily every single ministry, the claim suggests a widespread but not necessarily universal reduction.

Without specific data, the claim could be interpreted as follows:

- **True**: If almost every ministry has had salary reductions.
- **Mostly True**: If a significant majority of ministries have had salary reductions, but a few have not.
- **Half True**: If about half of the ministries have had salary reductions.
- **Mostly False**: If only a minority of ministries have had salary reductions.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to approach this:

1. **Verify the Economic Growth Rate**: Check reliable sources such as national statistical agencies, international organizations like the World Bank or IMF, or reputable economic reports to confirm the economic growth rate for the specified year.

2. **Context and Comparison**: Evaluate whether a growth rate of 4.7-4.8% is indeed a ""great deal"" compared to previous years, other countries, or economic expectations.

3. **Government's Role**: Assess whether the government's policies and actions have significantly contributed to this growth rate.

Given the information provided, here's a hypothetical evaluation:

- If the economic growth rate is accurately stated and is significantly higher than previous years or comparable countries, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the growth rate is accurate but not exceptional compared to previous years or other countries, the claim might be 'Half True'.
- If the growth rate is inaccurate or the government's role is overstated, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Young people aged 20 to 29 make up almost half of the unemployed,mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Young people aged 20 to 29 make up almost half of the unemployed,"" we need to consider the context and relevant data. Generally, unemployment rates can vary significantly by region and over time. However, in many economies, young people do face higher rates of unemployment compared to other age groups.

According to various studies and reports, such as those from the International Labour Organization (ILO), young people aged 20 to 29 often have higher unemployment rates compared to older adults. However, whether they make up ""almost half"" of the unemployed population can vary.

Without specific data for a particular region or time period, it is difficult to definitively say whether the claim is true or not. However, it is generally recognized that youth unemployment is a significant issue, and young people do represent a substantial portion of the unemployed population.

The claim suggests that Trump's signing of a budget law was the first instance where the occupation of Georgian territories was officially acknowledged or addressed in some way. To verify this, we would need to look at the specific budget law in question and any provisions related to Georgia.

Without additional details, such as the specific budget law, the provisions within it, and the historical context of U.S. policy toward Georgia, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge, it's likely that issues related to the occupation of Georgian territories have been addressed in various forms by previous administrations and in other contexts.

"Since 2010, the number of drug users has increased by about 15,000",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Since 2010, the number of drug users has increased by about 15,000,"" we need to consider the available data and context. Without specific data or sources, I can provide a general framework for evaluating such a claim:

1. **Data Verification**: Check if there are reliable sources (such as government reports, health organizations, or academic studies) that support the claim of a 15,000 increase in drug users since 2010.
2. **Context Consideration**: Consider the geographical area, the type of drugs, and the methodology used to measure drug use.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Look at trends over the years to see if the increase aligns with the claim.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, I will make a general assessment based on typical drug use trends and reporting:

- **True**: If reliable sources confirm a consistent increase of about 15,000 drug users since 2010.
- **Mostly True**: If the increase is significant but slightly different from 15,000.
- **Half True**: If the data shows an increase but not to the extent of 15,000.
- **Mostly False**: If the data shows a minor increase or a decrease.
- **False**: If the data shows no increase or a decrease in drug users.

Without specific details, it's challenging to provide a precise evaluation. However, generally speaking, if the statement suggests a significant military or political defeat that did not occur, it would likely be a distortion.

Given the lack of widely recognized historical events indicating a significant defeat for Georgia in 2011, the claim that such a statement is a distortion is likely true.

However, without specific details about the new constitution or what ""somehow"" refers to, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

Generally, constitutions are designed to be comprehensive and inclusive of various rights and freedoms. If the claim suggests that the new constitution restricts rights in some unspecified way, it would likely be inaccurate unless there is clear evidence to support such restrictions.

Given the lack of specific information, the claim seems to be a broad and vague statement. Therefore, without concrete evidence to the contrary, the claim that the new constitution's rights are restricted in some unspecified way is likely untrue.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
By 50%reduced foreign direct investment,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""By 50% reduced foreign direct investment,"" we would need specific context and data to determine its accuracy. Without additional information, such as the time period, the region or country in question, and the source of the data, it is impossible to accurately assess the validity of the claim.

However, if we were to consider this claim in general terms and without specific data, it would be classified as ""Half True"" because it lacks sufficient context and supporting evidence to be definitively true or false.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
Defendants did not have a touch on the cables that were embedded,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Defendants did not have a touch on the cables that were embedded,"" we need more context or evidence to determine its truthfulness. However, based on the literal interpretation of the statement, if the defendants indeed did not physically touch the cables, then the claim could be true.

Without additional context or evidence, the claim seems straightforward. If there is no evidence to contradict this statement, it can be considered true.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
"""The EU estimates has significantly improved the situation in prisons""",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The EU estimates has significantly improved the situation in prisons,"" we need more context and evidence. The EU does work on improving prison conditions through various programs and funding, but without specific data or reports, it's challenging to determine the extent of the improvements. However, the claim suggests a general improvement, which is likely based on ongoing efforts.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"Television receivers, modems, smartphones, tablets, netbooks and TVs in Rustavi ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Television receivers, modems, smartphones, tablets, netbooks and TVs in Rustavi ..."", it's necessary to have specific context or additional information. Without further details, such as the source of the claim, the context in which it was made, or the specific assertions being evaluated, it's challenging to determine its accuracy.

However, based on the general nature of the claim, which lists common electronic devices, it's likely referring to the availability or use of these devices in Rustavi. Given that these are widely used electronic devices globally, it's reasonable to assume that they are also available and used in Rustavi.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
The amounts allocated for concerts increased by GEL 2 million and advertising costs by 600 thousand GEL,true,ka,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to review the actual data or official records that show the allocated amounts for concerts and advertising costs. Without access to this specific data, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume you have the necessary context or data, here’s how you might evaluate the claim:

1. **Review the original and new allocations for concerts and advertising.**
2. **Compare the changes to see if they match the claimed increases.**

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the following hypothetical data:

- Original allocation for concerts: GEL 5 million
- New allocation for concerts: GEL 7 million
- Increase in concerts allocation: GEL 2 million (matching the claim)

- Original allocation for advertising: GEL 1 million
- New allocation for advertising: GEL 1.6 million
- Increase in advertising allocation: GEL 600 thousand (matching the claim)

Given this hypothetical data, the claim would be true.

**Final Answer: True**",true,True,False
"Compared to 2012, Georgia's economy has declined in dollars",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""Compared to 2012, Georgia's economy has declined in dollars,"" we would need to look at economic indicators such as GDP, per capita income, and other relevant metrics. However, without specific data, we can rely on general trends and historical context.

Over the past decade, most economies, including that of Georgia (the country), have generally shown growth rather than decline. This is typically reflected in increasing GDP figures and other economic indicators. Without specific data to the contrary, it is unlikely that Georgia's economy has declined in dollar terms since 2012.

Therefore, based on general economic trends and the typical growth patterns observed in most countries over time, the claim appears to be incorrect.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
“Georgia is in the first and second place among the Eastern Partnership countries.,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""Georgia is in the first and second place among the Eastern Partnership countries,"" we need to consider the context in which this claim is made. The Eastern Partnership countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.

The claim suggests that Georgia holds both the first and second positions among these countries, which is logically impossible in a straightforward ranking system where each position is unique.

However, if the claim is interpreted to mean that Georgia is highly ranked in various metrics or categories, it could be partially true. For example, Georgia might be ranked first in one category (such as economic growth) and second in another (such as democratic development).

Without specific context or data to support the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy. Based on the logical inconsistency of a single country holding both the first and second positions simultaneously, the claim is likely exaggerated or misleading.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"No less than 100,000 Telavi in ​​any of the villages",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""No less than 100,000 Telavi in any of the villages,"" we need to consider the context and the available data. Telavi is a city in Georgia, and it's unlikely that any single village would have a population of 100,000, let alone specifically people from Telavi.

Given the typical population sizes of villages and the specificity of the claim, it is highly implausible that any village would have 100,000 people from Telavi.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
A serious problem with the flooding of the city will get rid of Rustavi,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""A serious problem with the flooding of the city will get rid of Rustavi,"" we need to consider the logic and context of the statement. The wording suggests that serious flooding might somehow ""get rid of"" the city of Rustavi, which implies the city would be eliminated or destroyed by the flood.

However, flooding, even if serious, does not typically result in the complete elimination of a city. Floods can cause significant damage, but cities usually recover through reconstruction and mitigation efforts. Therefore, the claim that flooding will ""get rid of"" Rustavi is an exaggeration and not factually accurate.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,True,False
European Values ​​- Italian rescue services are fighting the sinking ships of migrants ...,half true,ka,"The claim ""European Values ​​- Italian rescue services are fighting the sinking ships of migrants ..."" is a complex one that requires context and nuance to evaluate accurately.

1. **Context**: Italian rescue services, including the coast guard and various NGOs, have been involved in numerous operations to rescue migrants from sinking or distressed vessels in the Mediterranean Sea. This is a well-documented fact and has been covered extensively by international media.

2. **European Values**: The phrase ""European Values"" is subjective and can be interpreted in various ways. Generally, it refers to principles such as human rights, democracy, and solidarity. Rescuing people in distress at sea aligns with these values, particularly the commitment to humanitarian principles.

3. **Accuracy**: The statement as a whole can be considered accurate in that Italian rescue services do engage in operations to save migrants from sinking ships. However, the phrasing ""fighting the sinking ships of migrants"" could be seen as overly dramatic and might imply a level of conflict or aggression that is not accurate. The primary goal of rescue services is to save lives, not ""fight"" ships.

Given these points, the claim is mostly accurate but could benefit from more precise language.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"The government has announced that in the next 4 years the infrastructure will be spent on 8 billion, which is unbelievable, which is ...",mostly false,ka,"Without additional context or specific details about the government's announcement, it is difficult to accurately assess the claim. Fact-checking requires verifying the source, the specific details of the announcement, and comparing it with reliable data.

However, based on the information provided, the claim that the government has announced spending 8 billion on infrastructure over the next 4 years is stated as factual. The phrase ""which is unbelievable"" seems to be an opinion rather than a factual component of the claim.

Given the lack of specific details to verify, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' if the government did indeed make such an announcement.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Last year two or more reforms were implemented in only 18 countries around the world and Georgia of these 18 countries ...,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we would need specific data on the number of countries that implemented two or more reforms last year and whether Georgia was among them. Without such data, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, assuming the claim is based on reliable data from a recognized source, and if that data confirms that only 18 countries implemented two or more reforms and that Georgia was one of them, then the claim would be accurate.

Given the hypothetical scenario where the data supports the claim:

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"According to Irakli Gharibashvili, compared to last year, after taking preventive measures, ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the truthfulness of Irakli Gharibashvili's claim, we would need specific data or context regarding the preventive measures taken and their outcomes compared to the previous year. Without such data, it is impossible to accurately assess the claim.

However, for the sake of providing a structured response, I will assume a general approach based on typical evaluations of such claims:

- **True**: Verifiable data shows significant improvement due to preventive measures.
- **Mostly True**: Most data supports the claim, but there are some minor discrepancies.
- **Half True**: The claim is partially accurate, but there are significant omissions or exaggerations.
- **Mostly False**: The claim contains some truth but is largely inaccurate.
- **False**: The claim is entirely unsupported by data.

Without specific data, I can only provide a hypothetical assessment:

**Final Answer: Half True**

This hypothetical assessment assumes that there is some evidence of improvement due to preventive measures, but the overall impact is not as substantial as claimed, or there are significant omissions in the data presented.",,False,True
"The disaster -affected population was given help in March when it was to happen in the winter.also, ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the timing of the help provided to the disaster-affected population. The claim states that help was given in March, which is typically considered a spring month, while the disaster was supposed to happen in the winter.

Based on the information provided, the claim suggests a mismatch between the timing of the disaster (winter) and the timing of the help provided (March). Without additional context or specific details about the disaster and the help provided, it is difficult to determine the complete accuracy of the claim. However, based on the given information, the claim seems to highlight a discrepancy in timing.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
The Georgian economy has declined in dollars.We made the economy from $ 4 billion to $ 16 billion ...,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and data regarding Georgia's economic growth. The claim states that the Georgian economy has grown from $4 billion to $16 billion in dollar terms.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. ** Context and Historical Data:**
   - Georgia's GDP in nominal terms has indeed grown significantly over the years. According to data from sources like the World Bank, Georgia's nominal GDP was around $4 billion in the early 2000s.
   - By more recent years, Georgia's nominal GDP has grown to around $16 billion.

2. **Accuracy of the Claim:**
   - The claim specifically mentions growth from $4 billion to $16 billion, which aligns with historical data showing significant economic growth in Georgia over the past few decades.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the historical data, the claim appears to be factually accurate.

**Final Answer: True**",true,False,False
"The number of debtors of banks in 2012 was 110,000, now that number has increased to 250,000.And, the pawnshop ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the provided information:

1. The number of debtors of banks in 2012 was 110,000.
2. The number of debtors has now increased to 250,000.

Without additional context or data sources to verify these figures, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the information given, we can infer that if the numbers are accurate, the claim could be considered true.

Since we lack external verification, we can only assess the claim based on the provided numbers. If these numbers are correct, the statement is true. If there is any doubt or additional context that contradicts these numbers, the claim could be categorized differently.

**Final Answer: True**",true,False,False
"In the village of Kortskheli the UNM is planning to disrupt the elections, for which Zaza Kedelashvili's probes on the spot ...",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the evidence and context behind it. However, without additional information or verification from reliable sources, it's difficult to definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim. The claim alleges that the United National Movement (UNM) is planning to disrupt elections in the village of Kortskheli and that Zaza Kedelashvili's probes are involved.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim and the need for verification from reputable sources, the most reasonable assessment without further information would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"“In recent months, up to 6%of the GEL has fallen.In recent months, a drop in Lira in Turkey is 25 %...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the percentage drops in the value of the Georgian Lari (GEL) and the Turkish Lira (TRY) over recent months.

1. **Georgian Lari (GEL)**: The claim states that the GEL has fallen by up to 6%. We need data to confirm if this is accurate.
2. **Turkish Lira (TRY)**: The claim states that the TRY has fallen by 25%. We also need data to confirm this.

Without specific data for the exact time period mentioned in the claim, it is challenging to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, let's assume we have access to reliable financial data sources that can confirm the following:

- The GEL has indeed fallen by approximately 6% in recent months.
- The TRY has indeed fallen by approximately 25% in recent months.

Given these assumptions, the claim would be accurate.

**Final Answer: True**",true,False,False
“I am talking about the changes that have been implemented and implemented since the new constitution came into force ...,false,ka,"To provide a precise assessment, I would need more context about the specific changes and the new constitution being referred to. However, based on the general phrasing of the statement, it suggests that changes have been made since the new constitution came into force, which is a claim that can be factually verified.

Given that the statement is about changes being implemented, without specific details, it is difficult to determine the complete truthfulness. However, if changes have indeed been implemented as a result of the new constitution, the statement would likely be at least partially true.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"“The salary of the MP is GEL 2,000 and receives 1 600 GEL.Prize in the Parliament of Georgia A ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider both the salary and the prize mentioned. The claim states that the salary of the MP is GEL 2,000 and that they receive an additional GEL 1,600 prize. Without external verification or additional context, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume that the figures provided are accurate, the claim would be considered true if both components are correct.

If the salary is indeed GEL 2,000 and the prize is GEL 1,600, then the claim is true. If there is any discrepancy in either the salary or the prize amount, the claim would be less accurate.

Final Answer: Without additional context or verification, it is difficult to definitively say, but if the figures are correct, the claim would be 'True'.",,False,True
The Mayor of Rustavi has taken the bonus while on vacation,true,ka,"To accurately assess the claim that ""The Mayor of Rustavi has taken the bonus while on vacation,"" additional context and evidence are required. Without specific details about when the bonus was taken, the policies surrounding bonuses, and the Mayor's vacation period, it is challenging to determine the veracity of the claim.

However, based on the general understanding of such claims, if the Mayor indeed received a bonus during a vacation period, and there is evidence to support this, the claim could be considered true. If there is only partial evidence or the details are unclear, it might be considered 'Mostly True' or 'Half True.' If there is significant evidence contradicting the claim or showing that the bonus was not taken during vacation, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

"“In 2011, our agriculture was 20%less than in 2003.Today is an increase in agriculture ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to check the data on agricultural production in the years 2003 and 2011. Without specific data, it is impossible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, given the lack of concrete evidence provided, the claim cannot be verified as entirely accurate.

Turkey is one of Georgia's largest trading partners and these relations are getting deeper,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, let's consider the economic relationship between Turkey and Georgia. Turkey is indeed one of Georgia's major trading partners. According to various economic reports and data, Turkey consistently ranks among the top countries with which Georgia conducts trade. Both exports from Georgia to Turkey and imports from Turkey to Georgia are significant. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts and agreements to deepen these trade relations further.

Given this information, the claim that ""Turkey is one of Georgia's largest trading partners and these relations are getting deeper"" is accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"“... at no point in them [the National Movement] was in cohabitation.In 9 years, ...",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need more context and specific details about the National Movement and the 9-year period mentioned. Without additional information, it is challenging to make an accurate assessment. The claim could be true if there was indeed no cohabitation during the specified period, but it could also be false or partially true if there were instances of cohabitation or if the period mentioned is not accurately represented.

The Secretary of the Security Council has no right to speak on behalf of the Council.Neither has the right to say that I - P ...,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the roles and responsibilities within the Security Council, particularly those of the Secretary. The Secretary of the Security Council is an administrative role that supports the Council's work but does not have the authority to speak on behalf of the Council without explicit authorization.

The claim states that the Secretary of the Security Council has no right to speak on behalf of the Council and neither has the right to say that they are representing the Council. This aligns with the general understanding of the Secretary's role, which is primarily administrative and supportive rather than representative.

Given this context, the claim appears to be mostly accurate. However, without specific details on the context in which this claim is made, it is challenging to assert its absolute truth. Nonetheless, based on the general understanding of the Secretary's role, the claim is largely accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
There is a great demand for Certificates of Bible Freedom ... Everything is under the law,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""There is a great demand for Certificates of Bible Freedom.""
2. ""Everything is under the law.""

Let's analyze each part:

1. **Certificates of Bible Freedom**: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there is no widely recognized or standardized document known as a ""Certificate of Bible Freedom."" Such a certificate does not appear to be a commonly issued or sought-after document. Therefore, the claim of great demand for it seems unfounded.

2. **Everything is under the law**: This statement is broad and could be interpreted in various ways. In a legal context, many aspects of life are indeed regulated by laws. However, the phrase ""everything"" is too absolute and could be misleading, as there are many aspects of life that are not directly governed by law.

Given these analyses, the claim as a whole is not accurate.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
Jobs have been reduced to a pandemic,true,ka,"The claim 'Jobs have been reduced to a pandemic' is a bit ambiguous, but it seems to suggest that jobs have been significantly reduced or lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While it's true that the pandemic has led to job losses and reduced employment in many sectors, it's not accurate to say that jobs have been reduced to the pandemic, as this phrasing implies that jobs have been entirely eliminated or that the pandemic is the sole factor affecting employment globally.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Due to cement dust, most people with tumors are in Kaspi",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Due to cement dust, most people with tumors are in Kaspi,"" we need to consider a few key factors:

1. **Evidence of Causation**: There must be scientific evidence linking cement dust to a higher incidence of tumors.
2. **Geographical Concentration**: There should be a significant concentration of people with tumors in Kaspi compared to other regions.
3. **Prevalence of Cement Dust**: Kaspi should have a notably higher exposure to cement dust compared to other areas.

Without specific scientific studies or data to support the claim that cement dust is the primary cause of tumors in most people in Kaspi, it is difficult to assert the claim as true. Additionally, the claim suggests a direct and primary causal link, which would require robust epidemiological studies to confirm.

Given the lack of specific evidence and the broad nature of the claim, it is more likely to be an overstatement or misinterpretation of available data.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,True,False
Public official [Ana Natsvlishvili] has no right and dares a lot when he speaks about parliament that he has made an irresponsible decision,false,ka,"The claim 'Public official [Ana Natsvlishvili] has no right and dares a lot when he speaks about parliament that he has made an irresponsible decision' is a subjective opinion rather than a factual statement. It expresses the speaker's perspective on Ana Natsvlishvili's actions and cannot be objectively verified as true or false. Therefore, it does not fit neatly into the categories of 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

However, if we need to categorize it based on the given options, it would be best described as 'Half True', because while the speaker may genuinely believe that Ana Natsvlishvili has no right and is daring, this is an opinion and not a factually verifiable statement.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"""Bendukidze has a $ 200 million property of the Agrarian University for 1 GEL""",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""Bendukidze has a $200 million property of the Agrarian University for 1 GEL,"" we would need to consider several factors, including the context, the source of the claim, and any available evidence or documentation.

Without additional context or evidence, the claim appears highly implausible due to the extreme disparity between the supposed value of the property ($200 million) and the reported cost (1 GEL). Such a transaction would be highly unusual and would likely attract significant scrutiny and documentation.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the lack of supporting evidence, the claim seems highly unlikely to be true.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"""We have seen the lari rate many times in recent years.""",mostly false,ka,"The claim that ""We have seen the lari rate many times in recent years"" is a bit ambiguous without additional context. If the claim is referring to the currency exchange rate of the Georgian lari, then it is likely true that the rate has fluctuated and been noticed many times in recent years. However, without specific details on what aspects of the lari rate are being referred to (e.g., significant fluctuations, specific economic events), it's difficult to pinpoint the exact truth value.

Given that currency exchange rates are regularly monitored and reported on, it is reasonable to assume that the lari rate has been observed and discussed multiple times in recent years.

"Obstetrician & nbsp; trust rating, our bank & nbsp; system is one of the best in Europe",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Obstetrician & nbsp; trust rating, our bank & nbsp; system is one of the best in Europe,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Clarity**: The statement is not entirely clear due to the misplaced ""& nbsp;"" which seems to be a typo or formatting error. It should likely read ""Obstetrician trust rating"" and ""our bank system.""

2. **Evidence and Verification**: Without specific data or external verification, it's difficult to confirm whether the bank system in question is truly one of the best in Europe. This claim requires substantive evidence from reputable sources to be considered true.

3. **Relevance of Obstetrician Trust Rating**: The mention of ""Obstetrician trust rating"" is unrelated to the claim about the bank system, which adds confusion to the statement.

Given the lack of clarity and evidence, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

"For the Georgian Railway, in terms of revenue, the most successful 2014-2015 year ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""For the Georgian Railway, in terms of revenue, the most successful 2014-2015 year ...,"" we need to consider the revenue data for Georgian Railway over several years. Without specific revenue figures, it is challenging to provide an accurate assessment. However, based on general economic trends and available information, we can make an educated guess.

If the claim is that 2014-2015 was the most successful year for Georgian Railway in terms of revenue, we would need to compare this period with other years to determine its validity. Without concrete data, we cannot definitively say whether this statement is true or false.

Given the lack of specific data, a reasonable approach would be to consider this claim as neither fully true nor false, but requiring more information to be accurately assessed.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"According to Dimitri Khundadze, the rate of pensions growth is at least equivalent to the rate of the previous government",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim made by Dimitri Khundadze, we need to compare the rate of pensions growth under the current government with that under the previous government. Without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I'll outline a general approach to assessing such a claim:

1. **Identify the Time Periods**: Determine the time periods corresponding to the current and previous governments.
2. **Gather Data**: Obtain official data on pension growth rates for both periods. This could be from government reports, statistical agencies, or other reliable sources.
3. **Compare the Rates**: Analyze the data to see if the rate of pensions growth under the current government is at least equivalent to that under the previous government.
4. **Contextual Analysis**: Consider any external factors that might affect pension growth, such as economic conditions, inflation rates, or changes in pension policies.

Without specific data, we can't provide a precise evaluation. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume a hypothetical analysis:

- If the data shows that the rate of pensions growth is indeed at least equivalent, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the data shows some discrepancies but the claim is generally accurate, it would be 'Half True'.
- If the data shows that the rate of pensions growth is significantly lower, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data, a conservative assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"""The President's Foundation is a different mechanism and its auditory inspection cannot be implemented""",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The President's Foundation is a different mechanism and its auditory inspection cannot be implemented,"" we need to consider the context and the standard practices regarding auditory inspections of foundations, particularly those associated with high-profile individuals like a president.

Generally, foundations, including those associated with high-profile figures, are subject to auditory inspections to ensure transparency, accountability, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The claim that such inspections cannot be implemented suggests an exemption or unique status that is typically not granted.

Without specific evidence or context that supports the claim of exemption from auditory inspections, the statement seems to imply an unfounded special treatment. Therefore, based on general principles of transparency and accountability, the claim is likely inaccurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Does not change the procedure of calculating the minimum wage and does not increase the minimum wage,true,ka,"The claim 'Does not change the procedure of calculating the minimum wage and does not increase the minimum wage' is a statement that requires context to evaluate accurately. Without specific context or additional information, it's challenging to determine its truthfulness. However, if we assume the context is about a specific policy or legislation that explicitly states it does not alter the existing method of calculating the minimum wage and does not raise the minimum wage, then the claim can be considered true based on that context.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
“Active work is underway to provide reclamation services for agricultural land ...,mostly true,ka,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim ""Active work is underway to provide reclamation services for agricultural land,"" we would need specific evidence or data that supports or refutes this statement. Since I don't have real-time access to current events or detailed information on this matter, I can only provide a hypothetical assessment based on general knowledge.

If there is documented evidence of ongoing projects or initiatives aimed at providing reclamation services for agricultural land, then the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True.' However, if the evidence is minimal or the projects are in their very early stages with little progress, the claim might be more accurately described as 'Half True.' If there is no substantial evidence to support the claim, it could be labeled 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Without specific evidence, a hypothetical assessment would be:

“The developments in Ukraine and Russia are more likely to export from these countries to Georgia ...,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The developments in Ukraine and Russia are more likely to export from these countries to Georgia,"" we need to consider the context and implications of the statement. The claim suggests that the political, economic, or social developments in Ukraine and Russia have a higher probability of affecting Georgia than other countries.

Georgia shares geographical proximity with both Russia and Ukraine, and historically, there have been political and economic ties between these countries. Therefore, it is plausible that developments in Ukraine and Russia could have a significant impact on Georgia. However, without specific details on what ""developments"" are being referred to and how they might ""export"" to Georgia, it is challenging to definitively assert the claim as entirely true or false.

Given the geopolitical context and historical ties, it is reasonable to say that the claim is likely to be at least partially true. However, without more specific information, it is not accurate to label it as entirely true.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"""More than a million Georgians live in Russia""",mostly false,ka,"The claim that ""More than a million Georgians live in Russia"" is a complex one to evaluate without precise and recent data. However, it is known that there is a significant Georgian diaspora in Russia, primarily due to historical and economic ties between the two countries.

According to various sources, the number of Georgians living in Russia has fluctuated over the years, but estimates often place the figure around several hundred thousand to over a million. Given the fluid nature of migration and the lack of precise, up-to-date statistics, it is challenging to definitively confirm the exact number.

Therefore, while it is plausible that more than a million Georgians live in Russia, the claim cannot be verified with absolute certainty. As such, it is reasonable to categorize the claim as 'Half True' due to the lack of definitive evidence.

"""We have implemented 1186 [infrastructure] project in the Samegrelo region""",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""We have implemented 1186 [infrastructure] project in the Samegrelo region,"" we would need to verify the number of projects implemented in that region. Without additional context or data, it's not possible to determine the veracity of this claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, I'll provide an example of how one might approach this if data were available.

Let's assume we have access to official records that show the following:
- The total number of infrastructure projects implemented in the Samegrelo region is 1150.

Based on this hypothetical data, the claim would be evaluated as follows:

- If the actual number is close to 1186 but not exact, it might be considered 'Mostly True'.
- If the actual number is significantly less than 1186, it might be considered 'Mostly False'.
- If the actual number is exactly 1186, it would be considered 'True'.

Given the hypothetical data (1150 projects), the claim is close but not exact.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
"Tax burden is a third country in the world, with a reduction in tax or a benefit ...",half true,ka,"The claim ""'Tax burden is a third country in the world, with a reduction in tax or a benefit ...' Is this claim 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'?"" is not clear enough to evaluate accurately. The phrase ""a third country in the world"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. Additionally, the phrase ""with a reduction in tax or a benefit"" is incomplete and does not provide enough information to determine the accuracy of the claim.

Without additional context or clarification, it is impossible to assign a truth value to this claim.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"“... The growth rate of the economy not just decreases, but even the pace of the decline itself is quite a bit ...",true,ka,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to analyze the economic data and trends relevant to the statement. The claim suggests that not only is the economy's growth rate decreasing, but the pace of this decline is also significant.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we are to evaluate the claim based on general economic principles and common trends:

1. **True**: The claim would be true if economic indicators show a significant deceleration in growth rates and an accelerating pace of decline.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim would be mostly true if there is evidence of decreasing growth rates and some indication of an increasing pace of decline, even if not as significant as suggested.
3. **Half True**: The claim would be half true if there is some evidence of decreasing growth rates but the pace of decline is not as substantial as implied.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim would be mostly false if there is little to no evidence of decreasing growth rates or if the pace of decline is not significant.
5. **False**: The claim would be false if economic data contradicts both the decreasing growth rates and the increasing pace of decline.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as potentially exaggerated but not entirely false. Therefore, without precise data, the claim could be characterized as:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
"Throughout Adjara, the number of families in crisis has increased in a crisis state who is in crisis ...",true,ka,"The claim is somewhat ambiguous due to its repetitive phrasing, but it suggests that the number of families in crisis has increased in Adjara. To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data or evidence to support the assertion that the number of families in crisis has indeed increased. Without such data, we cannot definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Given the lack of specific information and the vague nature of the claim, a reasonable assessment would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
The third phase of the water and sewer project in Batumi was to be completed in 2014,false,ka,"To accurately assess the claim, I would need specific information about the completion status of the third phase of the water and sewer project in Batumi by 2014. Without access to detailed records or official sources confirming the completion date, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, based on typical project timelines and the potential for delays or extensions, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as 'Half True' unless there is clear evidence to support or refute it.

The depreciation of the GEL is driven by loans issued by the National Bank to commercial banks,false,ka,"The claim that 'The depreciation of the GEL is driven by loans issued by the National Bank to commercial banks' is an oversimplification and does not fully capture the complexity of factors influencing currency depreciation. While the actions of a central bank, such as issuing loans to commercial banks, can have an impact on currency value, there are many other factors at play, including economic indicators, inflation, interest rates, political stability, and global economic conditions.

"""For the first time this year, visitors' decline""",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""For the first time this year, visitors' decline,"" we would need to verify whether the statement accurately reflects the data or reports on visitor numbers for the given context. Without specific data, it is impossible to conclusively determine the truth of the claim. However, based on the phrasing, it suggests that visitor numbers have decreased for the first time in the current year.

Without additional context or data, the best we can do is assume the claim is being made with some basis. If we assume the claim is based on reliable data, it would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. However, if the claim lacks sufficient evidence or is misleading in any way, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"In 2016-2017, the issuance of bonuses in the City Hall was reduced, and this year the award was not issued at all",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following:
1. Whether the issuance of bonuses in the City Hall was reduced in 2016-2017.
2. Whether bonuses were not issued at all this year.

Without specific data or reports to verify these points, we can only make a general assessment based on typical practices and available information.

If the claim is partially accurate—for instance, if there was a reduction in bonuses in 2016-2017 but bonuses were still issued this year, albeit at a lower rate—the claim would be considered 'Mostly False' because the statement suggests no bonuses were issued at all this year.

Final Answer: Mostly False.",mostly false,False,False
Age pension by 60%and pensions monthly expenditure increased by 28.3%,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following:

1. ""Age pension by 60%"" - This suggests that the age pension has increased by 60%.
2. ""Pensions monthly expenditure increased by 28.3%"" - This suggests that the monthly expenditure on pensions has increased by 28.3%.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify the exact percentages. However, we can analyze the claim logically:

- If the age pension increased by 60%, it would significantly impact the monthly expenditure on pensions.
- An increase in monthly expenditure by 28.3% could be plausible, but it seems low compared to a 60% increase in the age pension itself.

Given the discrepancy between the two percentages, the claim appears to be partially accurate but not entirely consistent. Therefore, the claim is likely not entirely true but has some elements of truth.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Georgian Post is not unprofitable, in 2017 it has been profitable",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgian Post is not unprofitable, in 2017 it has been profitable,"" we would need to examine the financial records or statements from Georgian Post for the year 2017. Without access to specific data, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on reliable financial reports or official statements from Georgian Post, the truthfulness of the claim would depend on whether those reports indicate a profit for the year 2017.

If Georgian Post reported a profit in 2017, the claim would be true. If the reports show a loss or break-even, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific data, we can only speculate. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume the claim is based on accurate financial reports.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"“Although salaries are increasing in the public sector, it has been lowered in the private sector ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to examine data on salary trends in both the public and private sectors. Without specific data or a source, it's not possible to definitively assess the claim. However, claims about broad economic trends often vary by region and time period, and can be complex and nuanced.

Given the lack of specific data, the most cautious assessment would be:

1. The claim states that the tax burden was 24.8% in 2013.
2. The claim states that the tax burden is now 25.5%.

Assuming the provided percentages are accurate, the tax burden has indeed increased from 24.8% to 25.5%.

"""The dynamics of Georgia have changed and the child poverty rate has decreased""",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""The dynamics of Georgia have changed and the child poverty rate has decreased,"" we need reliable data and context. As of my last update in October 2023, I can provide a general framework for evaluating such claims:

1. **Change in Dynamics**: This is a broad statement and can refer to various aspects such as economic growth, policy changes, or social developments. Without specific data, it's difficult to definitively say whether this part of the claim is true.

2. **Child Poverty Rate Decrease**: This is more specific and can be verified through statistical data. According to various sources, child poverty rates in Georgia (the state, assuming it's referring to the United States) have shown fluctuations over the years, but there have been efforts to reduce it through various programs and initiatives.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data, a balanced evaluation would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**

This reflects the likelihood that while there might have been changes in Georgia's dynamics and efforts to reduce child poverty, the specifics of whether the child poverty rate has definitively decreased would require more precise and up-to-date data.",,False,True

Without additional details, such as the source of the claim, the timeframe, and verification from reliable sources, it is challenging to definitively categorize the statement.

However, based on the general structure of the claim and the lack of specific details or context provided, it seems more reasonable to classify it as:

**Final Answer:** Half True.

This classification is based on the assumption that while there may be some truth to the expansion and launch of new enterprises, the specific numbers and the overall context are not fully verifiable without additional information.",,False,True
"Gori Cascading Fountain, for Rehabilitation of GEL 106 000, is dysfunctional",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Gori Cascading Fountain, for Rehabilitation of GEL 106 000, is dysfunctional,"" we need more context and evidence. Since I don't have real-time data or specific information about the current state of the Gori Cascading Fountain, I can't definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, I can guide you on how to assess it:

1. **Check Official Records**: Verify if there was indeed a rehabilitation project for Gori Cascading Fountain costing GEL 106 000.
2. **Site Visit or Local Reports**: Assess the current condition of the fountain through a site visit or reliable local reports.
3. **Government or Municipal Reports**: Look for any official statements or reports regarding the functionality of the fountain.

Without these details, the claim can't be accurately classified. For the purpose of this exercise, I'll assume the claim is based on some evidence but not fully verified, which would make it ""Half True.""

“Today we have about a hundred thousand new unemployed in Georgia.Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs ”,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the numbers provided regarding unemployment in Georgia. The claim states that there are ""about a hundred thousand new unemployed in Georgia"" and that ""hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs.""

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify the exact numbers. However, if we assume that ""hundreds of thousands"" implies at least 200,000 people, there is a discrepancy between the two figures given in the claim (100,000 vs. hundreds of thousands).

Given the inconsistency in the numbers provided within the same statement, the claim cannot be considered entirely accurate. Therefore, the most appropriate evaluation would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False

Without additional context or evidence, it is impossible to accurately assess the claim.

However, based on the information provided, the claim appears to be specific and could be verifiable with the appropriate documentation. If Mr. George Tevdoradze did sign such a document, the claim would be 'True'. If there is partial evidence or if the context is not fully accurate, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If there is no evidence or the claim is largely inaccurate, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

"In Slovenia, for example, sports involvement is 75%, we have a maximum of 10%",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""In Slovenia, for example, sports involvement is 75%, we have a maximum of 10%,"" we need reliable data on sports participation rates in Slovenia and the unspecified country being compared to Slovenia.

Without specific data, it's challenging to precisely confirm the claim. However, generally speaking, sports participation rates can vary widely by country based on cultural, economic, and social factors.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the following:

1. Slovenia has a high sports participation rate, which could be around 75% based on some sources.
2. The unspecified country has a much lower sports participation rate, which could be around 10%.

Given these assumptions, the claim could be considered plausible but would require specific data to confirm.

However, without additional context or data to compare this claim against, it is impossible to make a definitive judgment.

If the claim is based on official data from a reliable source and accurately reflects the current number of citizens in the debtors' registry, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the numbers are significantly off or not supported by reliable data, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

"In the first quarter of 2015, 5 main export components of Georgia were reduced ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine if the claim ""In the first quarter of 2015, 5 main export components of Georgia were reduced"" is true, we need to refer to reliable economic data from Georgia for that period. Without specific data, I can provide a general approach to evaluate such a claim:

1. **Identify the main export components**: Determine what the main export components of Georgia were in the first quarter of 2015.
2. **Check export data**: Look at the export data for these components to see if there was a reduction.
3. **Evaluate the reduction**: Verify if the reduction applies to all five main components.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I would need to make an educated guess based on typical economic trends and the likelihood of such a widespread reduction.

**Final Answer:** 'Half True'

This answer is based on the assumption that while it is possible for some main export components to experience a reduction, it is less common for all five to be affected simultaneously without significant economic disruptions.

Without access to real-time databases or the most current budgetary information, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to verify this claim:

1. **Check Official Budget Documents**: Review the latest budget reports from the Georgian government to see the percentage allocated to education and science.
2. **Consult the Constitution**: Look into the Constitution of Georgia to see if there are any specific restrictions or mandates regarding the budget for education and science.
3. **Cross-Reference with Reliable Sources**: Use reputable sources such as government websites, official reports, or statements from authoritative figures to confirm the information.

Given the information typically available, if the claim aligns with official documents and constitutional provisions, it would be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If there are discrepancies or the information is partially correct, it could be 'Half True'. If the claim significantly deviates from official data, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

"Wine exports decreased, but we would have had a much worse indicator if not market subversive ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Wine exports decreased, but we would have had a much worse indicator if not market subversive..."", we need to examine two parts of the statement:

1. **Wine exports decreased**: This is a factual claim that can be verified with data.
2. **We would have had a much worse indicator if not for market subversive activities**: This part is more speculative and depends on the interpretation of what ""market subversive"" means and its impact.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively label this claim. However, the phrase ""market subversive"" is ambiguous and could be interpreted in various ways, which makes the second part of the statement less reliable.

Given the lack of clear data and the ambiguity of the phrase ""market subversive,"" the claim is not entirely verifiable. Therefore, the most accurate label would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
We received excess income in property tax and budget for two quarters of 160%...,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider whether it is logically and mathematically possible for a property tax and budget to receive ""160% excess income"" for two quarters.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Excess Income**: This refers to income that exceeds the expected or budgeted amount.
2. **160% Excess**: If the income is 160% in excess, it means the actual income is 260% of the budgeted income (100% expected + 160% excess).
3. **Two Quarters**: This implies the excess income was received over a period of six months.

Mathematically, it is possible for income to exceed the budgeted amount by any percentage, including 160%. However, the claim does not provide specific figures or context, so it is difficult to verify its accuracy without additional information.

Given the lack of context and specific data, the claim cannot be definitively verified as true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False

Without additional information, such as the source of the claim, the current status of the project, and official statements or updates from relevant authorities, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

However, based on the typical evaluation criteria for such claims:

1. **True**: The claim is entirely accurate and supported by verifiable evidence.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim is largely accurate but may contain minor inaccuracies or lack some context.
3. **Half True**: The claim contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate information, or it may be accurate but misleading in its presentation.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim contains some elements of truth but is mostly inaccurate or misleading.
5. **False**: The claim is entirely inaccurate or fabricated.

Given the lack of contextual information, the most conservative approach would be to assume that the claim is neither entirely true nor entirely false without further evidence.

Without this comparative data, it is impossible to determine if the number of acquittals has indeed increased.

Given the incomplete nature of the claim and the lack of comparative data, the statement cannot be fully verified. Therefore, the best categorization for this claim would be:

Giorgi Kvirikashvili has never been in parliament since his approval,true,ka,"To determine the truth of the claim, ""Giorgi Kvirikashvili has never been in parliament since his approval,"" we need to verify the political history of Giorgi Kvirikashvili.

Giorgi Kvirikashvili served as the Prime Minister of Georgia from December 2015 to June 2018. During his tenure as Prime Minister, he was not a member of the Parliament of Georgia. After stepping down as Prime Minister, Kvirikashvili did not immediately become a member of parliament. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no record of Giorgi Kvirikashvili holding a parliamentary seat after his approval as Prime Minister.

Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is accurate.

"More than 1.7 billion salary expenses, reducing it by 20%means increasing the pension by 50 GEL",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to perform some calculations.

First, let's find out what a 20% reduction of 1.7 billion salary expenses would be:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 1.7 \text{ billion} = 0.20 \times 1.7 \text{ billion} = 0.34 \text{ billion} \]

Now, let's convert 0.34 billion into GEL (assuming 1 billion is 1,000,000,000):

\[ 0.34 \text{ billion GEL} = 0.34 \times 1,000,000,000 \text{ GEL} = 340,000,000 \text{ GEL} \]

The claim states that reducing the salary expenses by 20% means increasing the pension by 50 GEL. To check if 340,000,000 GEL is enough to increase the pension by 50 GEL, we need to know the number of pensioners. However, since we don't have that information, we can't verify the exact impact on the pension.

But we can determine if the reduction amount is reasonable for such a claim. If the number of pensioners is reasonable, then the claim could be plausible. However, without the exact number of pensioners, we cannot definitively say if the reduction would translate to a 50 GEL increase for each pensioner.

Given the uncertainty, the claim is not fully substantiated but also not entirely unreasonable. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

"The Georgian Dream has cut off the country, more unemployed, more debt to our budget",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The Georgian Dream has cut off the country, more unemployed, more debt to our budget,"" we need to break it down into its components and analyze each part:

1. **The Georgian Dream has cut off the country:** This is a vague claim and could refer to various issues like international isolation, reduced diplomatic ties, or economic sanctions. Without specific context, it's difficult to assess the truthfulness of this part of the claim.

2. **More unemployed:** To determine if unemployment has increased under the Georgian Dream's governance, we would need to look at official unemployment statistics over the relevant period.

3. **More debt to our budget:** This part of the claim suggests that the national debt has increased. Again, we would need to examine official data on the national debt to verify this.

Without specific data, it's challenging to give a definitive answer. However, based on the general nature of the claim and the lack of concrete evidence provided, we can make a preliminary assessment:

- **Unemployment and National Debt:** If official statistics show that unemployment and national debt have indeed increased during the Georgian Dream's tenure, this part of the claim could be considered true or mostly true.
- **Cut off the country:** This part is too vague to evaluate without additional context.

Given the lack of specific data and the vagueness of some parts of the claim, a reasonable assessment would be:

"Foreign investments also have a disadvantage, investors are delivering a dividend, today if we see that 2013 ...",mostly true,ka,"The statement ""'Foreign investments also have a disadvantage, investors are delivering a dividend, today if we see that 2013 ...'"" is somewhat ambiguous and lacks sufficient context to be accurately evaluated as true or false. However, the core of the statement suggests that foreign investments have a disadvantage because investors are delivering a dividend. This claim seems to imply that paying dividends is a disadvantage, which is not necessarily true or false without further elaboration.

Dividends are a way for companies to distribute profits to shareholders and can be seen as a positive aspect of investment. However, if the context is that dividends are draining resources that could otherwise be reinvested in the business, it could be seen as a disadvantage.

Without specific details or evidence, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general knowledge and typical standards for evaluating such claims, here's an analysis:

1. **Context**: Kakha Kaladze is a Georgian politician and former footballer. He has served in various ministerial positions, including as Minister of Energy.
2. **Investment in Energy**: The claim suggests that investing in the energy sector during his ministry was a good investment. This would require evaluating the performance and outcomes of energy-related projects or initiatives during his tenure.
3. **Lack of Specifics**: Without specific data on the success of the investments, returns, or impact on the energy sector, it's difficult to accurately assess the claim.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support or refute the claim, a cautious approach would be to categorize it as 'Half True'. This acknowledges that there might be some truth to the claim but also recognizes the need for more detailed information to make a definitive judgment.

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
“The number of people living in poverty has been substantially reduced and this figure is virtually updated ...,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we need context and data. The statement suggests that poverty reduction has been significant and that the data is regularly updated. However, without specific data or a timeframe, it's challenging to verify the claim definitively.

Generally, global poverty rates have indeed been reduced over the past few decades, with significant progress made in lifting people out of extreme poverty. Organizations like the World Bank regularly update their data on poverty rates.

Given this context, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but not entirely verifiable without more specific information.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"According to the regulations, the Minister is obliged to appear at a meeting with the faction in parliament",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""According to the regulations, the Minister is obliged to appear at a meeting with the faction in parliament,"" we need to consider the typical regulations governing parliamentary procedures in various jurisdictions. While the specifics can vary, generally, ministers have a responsibility to engage with parliamentary committees and factions to some extent.

However, the obligation for a minister to appear at every meeting with a faction may not be strictly mandated by regulations in all cases. Often, ministers have some discretion in scheduling their appearances, and the regulations may require them to respond to invitations or appear when summoned, rather than having a standing obligation to attend all meetings.

Based on this general understanding of parliamentary procedures, the claim is likely somewhat accurate but may not fully capture the nuances of the regulations.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"In 2018, tourist flow flow to Adjara increased by 16%, as well as the number of visitors to 124%...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, it's important to break down the two statements made:

1. ""In 2018, tourist flow to Adjara increased by 16%.""
2. ""In 2018, the number of visitors to Adjara [increased] to 124%.""

The first statement suggests that the tourist flow increased by 16% compared to the previous year. The second statement seems to imply that the number of visitors increased to 124% of the previous year's number, which is nonsensical if taken literally because it suggests more than doubling the number of visitors.

Given the ambiguity and potential misinterpretation in the second statement, it's likely that the claim is either exaggerated or incorrectly phrased. Without specific data to verify the exact percentages, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
The reports of international organizations say that Georgia's integration process with Pro ...,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The reports of international organizations say that Georgia's integration process with Pro ..."", we need to consider whether there is substantial evidence from reputable international organizations supporting Georgia's integration process with a specified entity (likely the EU or NATO, as these are common contexts for such reports).

Without specific reports or sources provided in the claim, it is challenging to give a definitive answer. However, generally speaking, international organizations like the European Union, NATO, and various other bodies often publish reports and assessments on the integration processes of countries like Georgia. These reports typically include evaluations of progress, challenges, and recommendations.

Given the general trend of such reports and the likelihood that international organizations do indeed report on Georgia's integration processes, the claim can be considered mostly true, assuming the context is typical (e.g., EU or NATO integration).

**Final Answer: Mostly True**",mostly true,False,False
"""Kartu"" fondunun köməyi ilə biz vardziyanın bərpa lahiyəsini housyata keçyrməyə başladıq.Biz Sapari K ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the context and verify the information provided. The statement mentions the use of a fund called ""Kartu"" to start the restoration of a Vardzia complex (a historical site in Georgia). The claim also mentions Sapari K, which might be an individual or organization involved in the project.

Without additional context or external verification, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the provided text alone, we can analyze it as follows:

1. **""Kartu"" fondunun köməyi ilə** (with the help of the ""Kartu"" fund): If the ""Kartu"" fund exists and is involved in such projects, this part could be true.
2. **vardziyanın bərpa lahiyəsini housyata keçyrməyə başladıq** (we started the restoration project of Vardzia): If there is evidence that the restoration project has begun, this part could be true.
3. **Biz Sapari K ...** (We Sapari K ...): The involvement of Sapari K would also need to be verified.

Given the lack of specific details and external verification, the claim can be considered 'Half True' because it mentions specific entities and actions but lacks sufficient evidence to be fully verified.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
“Public order and morality are the circumstances that may overcome discrimination ...,half true,ka,"The statement ""'Public order and morality are the circumstances that may overcome discrimination ...'"" is a complex one and its truth value can vary greatly depending on interpretation and context. Here's a brief analysis:

- **True/Mostly True**: In some legal systems and societies, there are indeed exceptions to anti-discrimination laws when it comes to maintaining public order or morality. For example, a religious organization might be allowed to discriminate based on religion for certain positions.

- **Half True**: While there are exceptions, they are usually narrowly defined and not universally applied. Moreover, what constitutes ""public order"" and ""morality"" can be highly subjective and contentious.

- **Mostly False/False**: Many would argue that discrimination should not be overcome by appeals to public order or morality, as these concepts can be used to justify prejudicial behavior. Additionally, international human rights law generally does not permit discrimination on grounds such as race, gender, or sexual orientation, regardless of appeals to public order or morality.

Given these considerations, it's difficult to label the statement as entirely true or false. Therefore, the most accurate assessment might be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"As a result of the accidents in production, most people died in 2010 - 81, Kh ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim 'As a result of the accidents in production, most people died in 2010 - 81, Kh ...', I would need to verify the data regarding production accidents and fatalities for the year 2010. Without specific data or context, it's difficult to make an accurate assessment.

However, based on general knowledge and typical reporting of such statistics, the claim appears incomplete and lacks sufficient context to be evaluated as true or false. The abbreviation 'Kh' is unclear and does not provide enough information to validate the claim.

Given the lack of clear and verifiable data, the claim seems dubious.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
There are more than 120 officers at the Ministry of Education and they have millions of GEL bonuses and d ...,mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we would need specific data on the number of officers at the Ministry of Education and the amount of bonuses they receive. Without this information, it's not possible to determine the veracity of the claim. However, based on general principles, let's break down the claim:

1. **Number of Officers**: The claim states there are ""more than 120 officers."" Without specific data, we cannot confirm or deny this part of the claim.
2. **Millions of GEL in Bonuses**: The claim states that these officers receive ""millions of GEL in bonuses."" This part of the claim would also require specific data on the total bonuses received by these officers.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
"""This project was not announced [Panorama Tbilisi] and the Sololaki Range is already being cut""",mostly false,ka,"To accurately assess the claim ""This project was not announced [Panorama Tbilisi] and the Sololaki Range is already being cut,"" detailed information about the project's announcement and the current state of the Sololaki Range would be necessary. Without specific evidence or further context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on typical scenarios:

1. **Project Announcement**: If there is no evidence of a formal announcement of the Panorama Tbilisi project, this part of the claim could be considered true.
2. **Cutting of Sololaki Range**: If there is evidence that the Sololaki Range is indeed being cut, this part of the claim could also be considered true.

Given the lack of specific details, a balanced assessment would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
"After the change of government, shore protection works were suspended in Batumi",false,ka,"To determine the veracity of the claim that ""After the change of government, shore protection works were suspended in Batumi,"" we would need to examine specific evidence and data regarding the timeline of government changes and the status of shore protection works in Batumi. Without access to such detailed information, I cannot definitively assess the accuracy of the claim.

However, for the sake of providing a structured response, let's assume we have evaluated the relevant data and found the following:

- There was a change of government in the recent past.
- Shore protection works in Batumi were indeed suspended around the time of the government change.
- There is some correlation or causal link between the change of government and the suspension of the works.

Given these hypothetical findings, the claim would likely be classified as 'Mostly True' if the suspension of works was temporally aligned with the change of government but not directly caused by it, or if there were other contributing factors.

**Final Answer: Mostly True**",mostly true,False,False
The 2015 budget has been exaggerated and this is the merit of the government,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The 2015 budget has been exaggerated and this is the merit of the government,"" we would need specific evidence to determine the extent of exaggeration and whether it is indeed a merit of the government. Without specific data or context, it is challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, based on the general nature of the claim and the lack of concrete evidence provided, it is likely that the claim is not entirely accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
The State Department has directly linked the case of Rustavi 2 to Euro-Atlantic integration,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The State Department has directly linked the case of Rustavi 2 to Euro-Atlantic integration,"" we would need to examine official statements, press releases, or other communications from the U.S. State Department that explicitly mention the case of Rustavi 2 in the context of Euro-Atlantic integration.

However, without specific evidence or sources provided, it is challenging to definitively verify this claim. Generally, the U.S. State Department does comment on issues related to media freedom and democratic institutions, which can be linked to broader goals of Euro-Atlantic integration.

Given the lack of specific context or direct quotes, the claim can be considered plausible but not fully verified. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Facebook has never mentioned the Georgian Dream,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Facebook has never mentioned the Georgian Dream,"" we would need to consider the context and scope of the statement. ""The Georgian Dream"" could refer to various things, such as a political party, a cultural movement, or a specific dream or aspiration. Given the vast amount of content on Facebook, it is highly unlikely that a broad and well-known topic like the Georgian Dream has never been mentioned.

However, without specific evidence or context, it is difficult to definitively prove or disprove the claim. Generally, considering the broad reach and diverse content on Facebook, it is more likely that such a topic has been mentioned at some point.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Gas into Ude and Arali and lit up, at the end of the year the population will be completely gasified",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need more context and specific data about the gasification plans for Ude and Arali. Without this information, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general knowledge about large-scale infrastructure projects, complete gasification of a population within a single year is often ambitious and unlikely due to various logistical, financial, and technical challenges.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
City Hall will definitely have to go through the competition for those employees who have passed the exam,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need more context about the specific regulations and procedures that ""City Hall"" follows regarding employee hiring and promotions. Without additional information or evidence to verify whether employees who have passed the exam are indeed required to go through a competition process, we cannot accurately determine the truthfulness of the statement.

However, based on general practices in many governmental organizations, passing an exam is often a prerequisite for certain positions, but it does not necessarily mean that a further competition process is always required. Therefore, without specific evidence, the claim seems to be an overgeneralization.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"In 2015, government debt deteriorated in relation to the country's economy ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""In 2015, government debt deteriorated in relation to the country's economy,"" we need to consider the context and data available for that year. Generally, government debt is often measured in relation to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). If the debt-to-GDP ratio increased in 2015, it would indicate that government debt deteriorated relative to the economy.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general economic trends and reports from various countries, it is known that many countries did experience an increase in their debt-to-GDP ratios in 2015 due to factors such as economic slowdowns, fiscal policies, and global economic conditions.

Given this context, the claim is likely to be at least partially true for many countries. However, without specific data for a particular country, we cannot definitively say it is entirely true.

**Final Answer: Mostly True**",mostly true,True,False
"During the United National Movement, the budget increased 6 times at the expense of foreign debt """,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""During the United National Movement, the budget increased 6 times at the expense of foreign debt,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Budget Increase**: We need to verify if the budget indeed increased sixfold during the United National Movement's tenure.
2. **Source of Increase**: We need to determine if the increase was primarily due to foreign debt.

Without specific data and context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, such a significant increase in the budget solely from foreign debt would likely have substantial economic implications and be well-documented.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the claim, it is reasonable to be skeptical of such a dramatic increase being solely attributed to foreign debt. Therefore, the claim might be exaggerated or misleading without proper context and data.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,True,False
"Balance balance deficit reduced to 8.7%, this with the stability of the GEL rate ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we would need to verify the following points:

1. The current balance of payments deficit as a percentage of GDP.
2. Whether the GEL (Georgian Lari) exchange rate has been stable.

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

Problem of gasification and water supply in the villages of Gori municipality ...,false,ka,"To accurately assess the claim ""Problem of gasification and water supply in the villages of Gori municipality ..."", I would need more specific context or data about the current state of gasification and water supply in the villages of Gori municipality. Without such information, it's challenging to make an informed judgment.

However, if we assume the claim is based on recent reports or credible sources indicating issues with gasification and water supply in these areas, the claim might be considered 'Mostly True' or 'True'. Conversely, if there is evidence contradicting these issues, it might lean towards 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
One of the lowest rates of corruption in Georgia and many European states in this regard ...,mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim 'One of the lowest rates of corruption in Georgia and many European states in this regard,' we need to consider data from reputable sources such as Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).

According to recent CPI reports, Georgia ranks relatively high among countries with low corruption levels, often outperforming many European states. For example, in 2021, Georgia ranked 45th out of 180 countries, with a score that placed it ahead of several European nations.

Given this information, the claim that Georgia has one of the lowest rates of corruption compared to many European states is generally accurate, though the specific ranking and comparison can vary year to year.

Zurab Japaridze points to problems in the 2013 state budget spending,mostly true,ka,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim ""Zurab Japaridze points to problems in the 2013 state budget spending,"" we would need to verify whether Zurab Japaridze actually made such statements. This would involve checking reliable sources such as official statements, interviews, or reports from reputable news outlets.

If there is evidence that Zurab Japaridze has publicly pointed out problems in the 2013 state budget spending, the claim would be considered true or mostly true. If there is no such evidence or if the statements are misrepresented, the claim would be considered false or mostly false.

Without specific information or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on typical fact-checking practices, if Zurab Japaridze has indeed made such statements, the claim would likely be:

**Final Answer: Mostly True**",mostly true,True,False
We are 114th in the world's level of life.So we were at Shevardnadze and Saakashvili's time.,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the historical rankings of the country in question (presumably Georgia) during the periods of Shevardnadze and Saakashvili compared to the current ranking.

1. **Current Ranking:** The claim states that the country is currently 114th in the world's level of life.
2. **Historical Rankings:** The claim suggests that the country was at the same ranking during the times of Shevardnadze and Saakashvili.

Without specific data on the historical rankings, it's challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable data from reputable sources such as international indices (e.g., Human Development Index, Quality of Life Index), we can make a general assessment.

Given that the claim is specific about the ranking being the same across different periods, it would require precise data to confirm. If such data is not readily available or if there are discrepancies in the sources, the claim's accuracy can be called into question.

Based on the typical variability in such rankings over time and the lack of specific data provided in the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim might not be entirely accurate without further evidence.

"""The number of non-refundable loans has increased by 38%compared to the previous year""",mostly true,ka,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim that ""The number of non-refundable loans has increased by 38% compared to the previous year,"" we need to rely on verifiable data or official sources. Without specific data or context, I cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false.

However, for the sake of completing the task, I'll provide a hypothetical analysis:

1. **True**: If reliable sources and data confirm that the number of non-refundable loans has indeed increased by 38% compared to the previous year.
2. **Mostly True**: If the increase is close to 38%, but not exactly 38%.
3. **Half True**: If there has been an increase, but it is significantly different from 38%.
4. **Mostly False**: If there has been a small increase or decrease, but not close to 38%.
5. **False**: If there has been no increase or a decrease in the number of non-refundable loans.

Without specific data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume we have verified data that shows a significant but not exact 38% increase.

Without access to detailed financial records or official reports, it is challenging to definitively confirm or deny this claim.

However, given that the claim involves specific individuals and a large sum of money, it would likely require substantial evidence to be considered true. In the absence of such evidence, the claim could be considered speculative or unverified.

**Final Answer: Half True**

Ian Kelly's statement by some media outlets in the case of Rustavi 2 has been misinterpreted,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Ian Kelly's statement by some media outlets in the case of Rustavi 2 has been misinterpreted,"" we would need to examine the original statement made by Ian Kelly, the context in which it was made, and how various media outlets have reported on it. Without access to these specific details, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

However, for the sake of argument, let's assume we have access to the necessary information and have conducted a thorough analysis. If we find that there are significant discrepancies between the original statement and the media reports, or if the media reports have altered the meaning or context of the statement, then the claim would be considered true or mostly true. Conversely, if the media reports accurately reflect the original statement, the claim would be false or mostly false.

Final Answer: Without specific details, a definitive answer cannot be provided. However, if based on a hypothetical thorough analysis, the claim would be 'Mostly True' if significant misinterpretations are found, or 'False' if the media accurately reported the statement.",,False,True

“David Narmania Ministry [Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure] approximately 130 ...,mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""David Narmania Ministry [Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure] approximately 130 ...,"" we need more context to understand what the number ""130"" refers to. Without additional information, it is impossible to accurately assess the truthfulness of the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a specific number of projects, employees, initiatives, or any other quantifiable metric related to the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure under David Narmania, we would need to verify this number against official records or reliable sources.

Given the incomplete nature of the claim and the lack of specific context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is:

"To read the conclusion well [OSCE], the first and most important thing is that the progress is very positively assessed that characterizes the choice of judges",half true,ka,"The claim appears to be a fragmented sentence that lacks clarity and context. It mentions the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) and the assessment of progress related to the choice of judges, but the statement is incomplete and poorly structured. Without additional context or a clear, complete statement, it is difficult to accurately assess its truthfulness.

Given the fragmented and unclear nature of the claim, it is challenging to assign a definitive truth value. Therefore, the most appropriate assessment would be that the claim is not sufficiently clear to be evaluated as true or false.

Investments from the United Arab Emirates exceeded $ 800 million,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Investments from the United Arab Emirates exceeded $800 million,"" we need more context, such as the time period and the specific type of investments being referred to. Without this additional information, it is challenging to provide an accurate assessment.

However, if we assume that the claim is about a specific context for which data is available and verifiable, and the statement aligns with verified data, then the claim could be considered true or mostly true. Conversely, if there is no supporting data or the data contradicts the claim, it could be considered half true, mostly false, or false.

Since I don't have access to external databases or current news sources to verify this claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. For the sake of this exercise, I will assume that the claim is based on verifiable data and that the data supports the claim.

This year's GDP growth is due to the fact that there was a very low growth last year ... GDP growth in recent years ...,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the specifics of GDP growth rates. The claim suggests that this year's GDP growth is primarily due to a low growth rate last year, implying a base effect where growth appears higher because it is compared to a lower base.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, it is a common economic phenomenon that a low base can make subsequent growth rates appear higher. Therefore, the claim has some truth to it, but it may oversimplify the complex factors influencing GDP growth.

Prices for important consumption products have increased,mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Prices for important consumption products have increased,"" we need to consider the general trends in prices for essential goods and services.

In recent years, there has been substantial evidence of inflation and price increases for many important consumption products such as food, energy, and housing. Various economic indicators and reports from government agencies and economic organizations have shown that prices for these goods have indeed risen.

While the extent of these increases may vary by region and product category, the overall trend supports the claim that prices for important consumption products have increased.

The Ministry of Environment should be a separate standing structure.The obligation to do this as an Association Agreement ...,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""The Ministry of Environment should be a separate standing structure"" and that ""The obligation to do this [is] an Association Agreement,"" we need to consider the context and the accuracy of the statement.

Firstly, the existence of a Ministry of Environment as a separate standing structure can vary by country and political structure. There is no universal obligation mandated by international agreements to have a separate Ministry of Environment.

Secondly, Association Agreements, such as those between the European Union and other countries, do not typically dictate the internal governmental structure of a country. They may set environmental standards and policies that countries need to adhere to, but they do not mandate the creation of specific ministries.

Given these points, the claim that there is an obligation under an Association Agreement to have a separate Ministry of Environment is not accurate.

"“Unlike previous years, in 2013, the private sector played a role in the economy.Village meu ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Unlike previous years, in 2013, the private sector played a role in the economy,"" we need to consider the historical context and the specific role of the private sector in the economy in 2013 compared to previous years.

However, without additional context or specific data, it is challenging to definitively determine the accuracy of this claim. The private sector has typically played a significant role in most economies, including in the years leading up to 2013. If the claim suggests that the private sector's role was notably different or more prominent in 2013 compared to previous years, we would need specific evidence to support that.

Given the lack of specificity and the general nature of the claim, it is difficult to assign a definitive truth value.

“In Spain for just one suicide when a Spanish woman was evicted ...,mostly true,ka,"To assess the claim ""In Spain for just one suicide when a Spanish woman was evicted,"" we need to consider the specificity and context of the statement. The claim implies that there was only one instance of suicide in Spain directly linked to an eviction of a Spanish woman.

Without additional context or data, it's challenging to verify this claim accurately. Suicides related to evictions are a serious issue, but they are typically not isolated incidents. The claim that there was ""just one"" such case seems to simplify a complex issue.

Given the lack of specific data to support the singularity of the event, the claim appears to be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of the situation.

"The Prosecutor's Office was interested in my election registration documentation, which has nothing to do with pardon ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the truthfulness of the claim, we need to consider the context and the information provided. The claim suggests that the Prosecutor's Office was interested in the speaker's election registration documentation and that this interest had nothing to do with a pardon.

Without additional context or evidence, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, the claim itself is a statement of fact about the Prosecutor's Office's actions and the speaker's interpretation of those actions. If the Prosecutor's Office was indeed interested in the election registration documentation and if this interest was unrelated to a pardon, then the claim could be considered true.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"""European Parliaments are eager to make the opposition more constructive and cooperate with the government""",false,ka,"The claim that ""European Parliaments are eager to make the opposition more constructive and cooperate with the government"" is a generalization that may not accurately reflect the diverse political dynamics across different European countries. While some European parliaments and political parties may indeed strive for more constructive opposition and cooperation, others may be characterized by polarization and conflict. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but may contain elements of truth.

"Now 4,000 cars are sold in Rustavi a month, but in 2010-2012 this figure will be 10 thousand ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the data provided. The statement claims that the number of cars sold in Rustavi will increase from 4,000 per month to 10,000 per month by 2010-2012.

Without specific data or sources to verify the exact figures, we can only make a judgment based on general economic trends and the plausibility of such a significant increase in car sales.

1. **Initial Figure**: 4,000 cars sold per month.
2. **Projected Figure**: 10,000 cars sold per month by 2010-2012.

A 2.5 times increase in car sales within a few years is plausible, especially if there are significant economic developments or changes in the market conditions. However, such a dramatic increase would likely be influenced by major factors such as increased economic prosperity, new car manufacturing plants, or substantial changes in consumer behavior.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, it is reasonable to assume that while the increase is possible, it is also highly ambitious. Therefore, the claim could be considered speculative but not entirely implausible.

"State enterprises are stolen, more than a billion GEL was the loss in 2017",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""State enterprises are stolen, more than a billion GEL was the loss in 2017,"" we need to consider the following factors: the context of the claim, the credibility of the source, and any available data or reports that support or refute the claim.

1. **Context of the Claim**: The claim suggests that state enterprises in Georgia were subject to theft or mismanagement, resulting in a significant financial loss of over a billion Georgian Lari (GEL) in 2017.

2. **Credibility of the Source**: Without knowing the source of the claim, it is challenging to assess its credibility. The source could be a government report, a news article, or a statement from an individual or organization.

3. **Available Data or Reports**: To verify the claim, we would need to consult financial reports, audits, or investigations from reputable sources such as the Georgian government, independent auditing firms, or international financial bodies.

Without specific data or reports to corroborate the claim, it is difficult to definitively state its accuracy. However, such a large financial loss would likely be well-documented and widely reported if true.

"""Absurd to health insurance does not actually cover anything""",mostly false,ka,"The claim that ""health insurance does not actually cover anything"" is a broad and exaggerated statement that does not accurately reflect the functioning of health insurance in most contexts. Health insurance typically covers a wide range of medical expenses, including preventive care, medical treatments, hospital stays, and prescription drugs, among others. While there may be exceptions, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs, the assertion that health insurance does not cover anything is generally false.

"IDPs are building the road at their own expense, and the local authorities have been able to withdraw bonuses ...",half true,ka,"To assess the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) Building the Road at Their Own Expense:** This suggests that IDPs are using their own resources to construct a road. This part of the claim would need evidence to support whether IDPs are indeed funding and building the road.

2. **Local Authorities Withdrawing Bonuses:** This implies that local authorities are saving money by not having to fund the road construction themselves, and possibly using those funds for other purposes, such as bonuses. This part also requires evidence to verify if local authorities are actually withdrawing bonuses because of the IDPs' actions.

Without concrete evidence or context, it's challenging to definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the information provided, the claim seems to suggest a direct causal relationship between the IDPs' actions and the local authorities' financial decisions, which would need substantial proof to be fully believed.

Without this context, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of the claim.

However, generally speaking, promoting the exposure of adolescents to scenes containing violence is not a typical or ethical stance for a public official, including a governor. If there is no supporting evidence or credible sources backing this claim, it is likely to be false or highly misleading.

"“We were talking about legalized lands, it was necessary to continue the process we started ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""We were talking about legalized lands, it was necessary to continue the process we started ..."", we need more context to determine its accuracy. Without additional information about the specific discussion, the legalization process, and the parties involved, it's challenging to assign a definitive truth value.

However, based on the general structure and content of the statement, it suggests a discussion and a process related to ""legalized lands."" If the statement accurately reflects a conversation and an ongoing process, it could be considered true or mostly true. If the discussion or process did not occur as described, it could be considered false or mostly false.

"Irakli Khakhubia, a sponsor of the National Movement, today is ""Dream""",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Irakli Khakhubia, a sponsor of the National Movement, today is 'Dream',"" we need more context and concrete evidence. Without specific details about the historical or current political affiliations of Irakli Khakhubia, it is difficult to assess the claim accurately.

However, based on typical patterns of political sponsorship and affiliation changes, it is not uncommon for individuals to shift their support or alignments over time. Therefore, without additional information, the claim could be considered speculative but not entirely implausible.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"“In April, wine exports amounted to 19 million bottles, which increased by 180%of the previous year ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand what an 180% increase means. If the wine exports increased by 180% from the previous year, this means the current year's exports are 280% of the previous year's exports (100% of the previous year + 180% increase).

Let's assume the previous year's exports were X bottles. Then, the current year's exports would be 2.8X bottles. The claim states that the current year's exports are 19 million bottles. So, we have:

2.8X = 19 million bottles

To find X, we divide both sides by 2.8:

X = 19 million bottles / 2.8
X ≈ 6.79 million bottles

So, the previous year's exports would have been approximately 6.79 million bottles. An increase to 19 million bottles from 6.79 million bottles is indeed an 180% increase.

Therefore, the claim is mathematically accurate. However, without additional context or data to verify the actual export numbers, we can only assess the claim based on the given information.

Residents are asking for help from City Hall,"" we would need to consider several factors, including the current condition of Utseri Street, the duration for which it has been in poor condition, and whether residents have indeed been requesting assistance from City Hall.

Without specific data or evidence to verify the claim, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general practices, if residents are publicly voicing concerns about the street's condition and requesting help from local authorities, it suggests there is some validity to the claim.

"For the first time, artificial skiing took place, which increased the season to 5 months",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""For the first time, artificial skiing took place, which increased the season to 5 months,"" we would need to consider historical context and specific details about the implementation of artificial skiing. Without additional context or data, it's challenging to definitively categorize this claim. However, artificial skiing (using snowmaking technology) has indeed extended ski seasons in many locations, though the extent to which it increased the season to exactly 5 months may vary by location and year.

Administration Salary Fund does not grow,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim 'Administration Salary Fund does not grow,' we need context and data regarding changes in the Administration Salary Fund over time. Without specific data, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, typically, such funds can fluctuate based on budget allocations, economic conditions, and policy changes.

If there is evidence of no growth or minimal changes over a significant period, the claim might be considered 'Mostly True.' If there is evidence of some growth, but not substantial, it might be 'Half True.' If there is clear and consistent growth, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Without specific data or context, a conservative assessment would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
"Financing of medicines does not include universal health care, and the prices of medicines for almost the third time ...",true,ka,"The claim 'Financing of medicines does not include universal health care, and the prices of medicines for almost the third time ...' is incomplete and lacks context, making it difficult to evaluate its truthfulness fully. However, the statement as it stands suggests that universal health care does not cover the financing of medicines and that medicine prices have increased significantly.

In many universal health care systems, the financing of medicines is indeed included, although the extent and coverage can vary. Additionally, the claim about medicine prices increasing ""for almost the third time"" is unclear without further context or data to support it.

Given the lack of clarity and the incomplete nature of the claim, it is difficult to definitively categorize it as true or false. However, based on the general understanding of universal health care systems, the claim seems to be partly inaccurate.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
“Prices for medicines have increased by 25%.Medications are one of the most disadvantages of healthcare ...,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two parts: the statement about the increase in medicine prices and the broader assertion about medications being a disadvantage in healthcare.

1. ""Prices for medicines have increased by 25%."" This claim requires specific data to verify. Without context, such as the time period, region, or specific medicines, it's challenging to label this as entirely true or false. Generally, medicine prices can fluctuate due to various factors, and a 25% increase could be plausible but would need supporting evidence.

2. ""Medications are one of the most disadvantages of healthcare."" This is a subjective statement. While medications can be expensive and have side effects, they are also essential for treating many conditions. Therefore, labeling them as a ""disadvantage"" without context or qualification is misleading.

Given the lack of specific data and the subjective nature of the second part of the claim, the most accurate evaluation would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"Billions are spent on defense and NATO projects.Georgia's defense needs 600 million, with 400 million ...",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Billions spent on defense and NATO projects**: This is generally true. Many countries, particularly NATO members, spend billions on defense and related projects annually.

2. **Georgia's defense needs 600 million**: This is more specific and requires verification. Without specific data, it's difficult to confirm the exact amount needed for Georgia's defense.

3. **With 400 million**: This part of the claim is unclear without additional context. It could be referring to an allocation or a shortfall, but without more information, it's hard to assess its truthfulness.

Given the lack of specific details and verification for the amounts related to Georgia's defense, the claim is partially true but lacks sufficient evidence to be fully validated.

Without such data, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

However, if we assume that there is reliable data that confirms the amount of 140.7 million GEL received from privatization in 8 months, then the claim would be:

**Final Answer: True**",true,True,False
"By my order, the Hauptwachts were abolished in the Georgian army",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""By my order, the Hauptwachts were abolished in the Georgian army,"" we need to consider the historical context and specific details of military reforms in Georgia.

The term ""Hauptwacht"" is not commonly associated with the Georgian army but rather with German or Prussian military traditions, referring to a main guard or central guardhouse. The claim suggests that the speaker took action to abolish this structure within the Georgian army.

Without specific historical evidence or context provided, it is challenging to verify the accuracy of this claim. The Georgian army has undergone various reforms over the years, but the abolition of ""Hauptwachts"" is not a well-documented event in recent military history.

Given the lack of specific details and the unusual term used, the claim is likely exaggerated or inaccurate without further evidence.

However, without specific data or sources provided in the claim, it is difficult to ascertain its accuracy. Additionally, the claim is somewhat vague as it does not specify the type of exports (e.g., goods, services, specific countries) or the context (e.g., global exports, exports from a specific country).

Given the lack of specific context and verifiable data, the claim cannot be definitively verified as true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

Without access to specific data, we cannot definitively confirm or deny these figures. However, assuming the claim is based on factual data from trustworthy sources, we can evaluate its accuracy based on the provided numbers.

If the figures are supported by official data, the claim would be considered accurate. If the figures are partially supported but with some discrepancies, it might be considered ""Mostly True."" If the figures are significantly different from official data, it could be considered ""Mostly False"" or ""False.""

"Funding for the CSU does not grow, it was allocated for four months",false,ka,"Without additional context or specific data on the funding for the CSU (California State University), it is challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim. The claim suggests that funding for the CSU does not increase and that it was allocated for only four months. To accurately assess this claim, one would need to review official budget documents, statements from the CSU or relevant government agencies, and any recent news articles or reports on the subject.

If the claim is based on a specific budgetary period or recent policy changes, it could be evaluated as follows:

- **True**: If there is clear evidence that funding has remained static and was indeed allocated for just four months.
- **Mostly True**: If the main points are accurate but there are minor inaccuracies or missing details.
- **Half True**: If the claim is somewhat accurate but also contains significant inaccuracies or omissions.
- **Mostly False**: If the claim contains major inaccuracies but has some elements of truth.
- **False**: If the claim is entirely inaccurate or misrepresents the facts.

Given the lack of specific information, a general assessment would be:

Without specific information about the source of the claim, the region or country it refers to, and any supporting evidence, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have some general criteria for evaluating such claims:

1. **True**: The claim is fully accurate and supported by reliable sources.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim is largely accurate but may have minor inaccuracies or lack full context.
3. **Half True**: The claim contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate information.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim is mostly inaccurate but contains some elements of truth.
5. **False**: The claim is completely inaccurate and not supported by reliable sources.

Population affected by frost in Shida Kartli did not help the authorities,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Population affected by frost in Shida Kartli did not help the authorities,"" we need more context and evidence. However, based on the general structure of such claims, here's a logical breakdown:

- **True**: The claim would be true if there is conclusive evidence that the population in Shida Kartli did not help the authorities in any way.
- **Mostly True**: The claim would be mostly true if there is evidence that a significant portion of the population did not help the authorities, but some did.
- **Half True**: The claim would be half true if there is equal evidence that some people helped while others did not.
- **Mostly False**: The claim would be mostly false if there is evidence that a significant portion of the population did help the authorities, but some did not.
- **False**: The claim would be false if there is conclusive evidence that the population in Shida Kartli did help the authorities.

Without this data, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

However, assuming that the increase in budget revenue is indeed 50% compared to 2012, the claim is factual in terms of the increase. Whether this increase translates to specific benefits for Georgian citizens is a separate issue and depends on how the increased revenue is being used.

Given the information provided, the claim about the increase in budget revenue can be considered factual if the data supports it. Therefore, without additional context on the impact on citizens, the claim about the increase itself can be evaluated as follows:

According to data from organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Georgia's GDP growth rate in 2014 was approximately 4.6%. This rate did not exceed 5%.

Therefore, the claim that Georgia's economic growth would exceed 5% in 2014 is not accurate based on the available data.

1. **Context and Sources**: Look for official statements or budget documents from Kutaisi City Hall that outline spending on cars for residents.
2. **Verification**: Check if any reputable news outlets or government reports confirm this figure.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare this claim with previous years' expenditures or similar expenditures in other cities.

Without specific data, it's impossible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume we have some context:

- If there is a reliable source confirming that Kutaisi City Hall has allocated GEL 800,000 for cars for residents this year, the claim would be **True** or **Mostly True**.
- If the source is partially reliable or if the figure is disputed but generally aligns with other reports, the claim might be **Half True**.
- If there is conflicting information or the source is unreliable, the claim might be **Mostly False**.

2. **Second Largest City, Kutaisi**: Kutaisi is indeed the second largest city in Georgia.
3. **Four-hour graphics there is water**: This part of the claim suggests that water is only available for four hours in Kutaisi.

However, the claim lacks specific details about the water supply situation in Kutaisi, such as whether the four-hour water supply is a regular occurrence, a temporary issue, or if it applies to the entire city or just certain areas. Without more context or recent data, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of this statement completely.

We have lost 300 million GEL by achieving 3%economic growth,mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the underlying assumptions. The claim suggests that achieving 3% economic growth resulted in a loss of 300 million GEL. Without specific details on how economic growth led to a financial loss, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the statement.

Economic growth typically refers to an increase in the production of goods and services, which usually benefits the economy. However, there could be specific circumstances where achieving economic growth might incur costs or losses, such as increased government spending, inefficient allocation of resources, or other economic factors.

Without additional context or data to support the claim that 3% economic growth directly resulted in a loss of 300 million GEL, the statement seems implausible. Economic growth is generally associated with positive outcomes rather than direct financial losses.

Without specific data or reports, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you through the factors to consider:

1. **Water Quality Reports**: Check official reports from local water authorities or environmental agencies. These reports typically provide data on water quality parameters such as contaminants, pH levels, and bacteria counts.

2. **Public Health Records**: Look for any reports of waterborne illnesses or health issues related to water quality in Marneuli.

3. **Resident Feedback**: Gather feedback from residents about their experiences with water quality. This can provide anecdotal evidence but should be considered alongside official data.

4. **Infrastructure**: Assess the state of water treatment and distribution infrastructure in Marneuli. Well-maintained infrastructure is crucial for delivering high-quality water.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, a general assessment might suggest that the claim could be ""Mostly True"" if most residents receive clean water but there might be occasional issues or areas with lower quality. Conversely, if significant issues are known, the claim could be ""Mostly False.""

However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable data stating that there is indeed no gasification in those three districts and that the rest of Georgia has different gasification statuses, we can make an educated guess.

"Interest rates during the previous government were 21%, which is reduced by 3 times",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand what ""reduced by 3 times"" means. If the interest rate was reduced by 3 times, it implies that the rate was divided by 3.

Starting with an interest rate of 21%, if it were reduced by 3 times, the new interest rate would be:
\[ \frac{21\%}{3} = 7\% \]

If the current interest rate aligns with this calculation, the claim would be true. However, without specific information about the current interest rate, we cannot definitively confirm the claim's accuracy.

Given the information provided:
- The claim states that the interest rate was reduced by 3 times from 21%.
- If the current interest rate is indeed 7%, the claim is accurate.

Therefore, based on the provided information and assuming the current interest rate is 7%, the claim would be true.

The Georgian government sent a note and told him ..."", we need to break down the statement into its components and analyze each part for accuracy.

1. **Nika Gilauri as Ukrainian Business Ombudsman**:
   - Nika Gilauri is a Georgian politician and economist. He served as the Prime Minister of Georgia from 2009 to 2012.
   - There is no widely reported or confirmed information that Nika Gilauri was meant to be a Ukrainian business ombudsman.

2. **Georgian Government Sent a Note**:

"During the previous government there was an average of 10 km on the highway a year, and today 28 km every year ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we would need specific data on the kilometers of highway constructed during the previous government and the current government. Without this data, we cannot accurately determine the truthfulness of the statement. However, I can provide a general approach to how you might evaluate such a claim if you had the necessary information.

1. **True**: If data shows that the previous government constructed an average of 10 km of highway per year and the current government is constructing an average of 28 km per year, then the claim is true.

2. **Mostly True**: If the data shows that the figures are close to 10 km and 28 km respectively, with minor variations, the claim can be considered mostly true.

3. **Half True**: If one part of the claim is accurate (e.g., the previous government's average) but the other part is significantly off (e.g., the current government's average), the claim can be considered half true.

4. **Mostly False**: If the data shows significant discrepancies from the claimed figures but there is some element of truth, the claim can be considered mostly false.

5. **False**: If the data shows that neither the previous government's average nor the current government's average is close to the claimed figures, the claim is false.

Without the actual data, we cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the information typically required for such evaluations, the process would involve comparing the stated averages with the actual data on highway construction.

"""Exports have increased significantly ... we have had an export reduction in recent years""",mostly false,ka,"The claim states that ""Exports have increased significantly"" but also mentions that ""we have had an export reduction in recent years."" These two statements are contradictory. If exports have increased significantly, they cannot have also reduced in recent years unless there is a specific context or timeframe that explains this discrepancy.

Given the contradiction, the claim cannot be entirely true. At best, it might be partially accurate depending on the specific timeframes or conditions not mentioned in the claim.

"""A swampy lake has emerged on the territory of abandoned construction in Avlabari, Avlabari""",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Existence of the Swampy Lake**: Whether there is indeed a body of water that can be described as a ""swampy lake"" in the specified location.
2. **Location**: Whether the specified location, ""Avlabari, Avlabari,"" is accurate and specific enough.
3. **Abandoned Construction**: Whether there is evidence of abandoned construction in the area where the swampy lake is supposed to be.

Without specific information or evidence to verify each of these points, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the general structure of the claim and the need for more specific details, it seems reasonable to classify it as ""Half True"" unless further evidence proves otherwise.

**Final Answer:** Half True",half true,False,False
One of the reasons for the depreciation of the GEL is foreign debts accumulated by the previous government,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""One of the reasons for the depreciation of the GEL is foreign debts accumulated by the previous government,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Foreign Debt and Currency Depreciation**: High levels of foreign debt can indeed contribute to the depreciation of a currency. When a country has significant foreign debt, it may need to increase its exports to earn foreign currency to service the debt. This can lead to a higher supply of the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market, causing its value to decrease.

2. **Previous Government's Role**: The claim specifically attributes the debt to the previous government. To fully assess this, one would need to look at data on foreign debt levels during the tenure of the previous government and any significant changes in debt policy that occurred.

3. **Other Factors**: Currency depreciation can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including economic policies, inflation rates, trade balances, and global economic conditions. Attributing depreciation solely or primarily to foreign debt accumulated by the previous government may oversimplify a complex situation.

Without specific data on the level of foreign debt and its impact on the GEL during the previous government's tenure, it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general economic principles, foreign debt can be a contributing factor to currency depreciation.

Kutaisi Cleaning Service comes from three seats,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Kutaisi Cleaning Service comes from three seats,"" we need to consider whether ""Kutaisi Cleaning Service"" is a legitimate entity and whether it operates from three specific locations or seats.

Without additional context or specific details about ""Kutaisi Cleaning Service"" and its operations, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable information about the service's operations, we can evaluate it as follows:

1. **True**: The claim would be true if there is documented evidence showing that Kutaisi Cleaning Service operates from exactly three locations.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim would be mostly true if there is evidence that Kutaisi Cleaning Service operates from approximately three locations, with minor discrepancies.
3. **Half True**: The claim would be half true if some aspects of the claim are correct (e.g., the service operates from multiple locations), but the specific number of three seats is not accurate.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim would be mostly false if the service operates from a number of locations significantly different from three.
5. **False**: The claim would be false if there is no evidence that Kutaisi Cleaning Service exists or operates from any specific number of locations.

Given the lack of specific information provided, and assuming a general evaluation based on common knowledge or available data, the claim could be considered **Half True** if there is some evidence of multiple locations but not necessarily three.

"In 2017, exports to China exceeded $ 200 million.In the run, this data is significantly ...",true,ka,"Without specific data for 2017 exports to China, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, given that the statement mentions exports exceeding $200 million, which is a relatively modest figure for major economies, it is plausible. Economic data often shows significant trade volumes between major countries like the United States and China.

To provide a precise evaluation, more detailed and verified data from reliable sources such as government trade statistics or international trade reports would be necessary.

The ministry has never had 2 billion l ..."", we would need to verify several points:

1. Whether Maya Tskitishvili made this statement.
2. Whether the ministry indeed received 2 billion lari in 2019.
3. Whether this amount was unprecedented for the ministry.

Without access to specific databases or reports to verify these details, I can only provide a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. **Verify the Source**: Check official records or statements from Maya Tskitishvili to confirm if she made this claim.
2. **Check Budget Allocations**: Review the ministry's budget reports for 2019 and previous years to determine if 2 billion lari was allocated and if this amount was indeed the highest ever received.
3. **Historical Comparison**: Compare the 2019 allocation with allocations from previous years to confirm the ""unprecedented"" nature of the funding.

Given the information provided, if we assume the statement was made and the figures are accurate based on available data, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. However, without concrete evidence, a definitive answer cannot be given.

Without additional information or a reliable source to cross-reference, it's impossible to accurately assess the claim.

However, based on the information provided in the statement alone, it appears to be a factual assertion that could potentially be true. But without verification, we cannot definitively label it as such.

"In 2008, out of 18,000 cases, the court issued an acquittal of only one",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""In 2008, out of 18,000 cases, the court issued an acquittal of only one,"" we would need specific data on the acquittal rates for the year 2008 in the relevant jurisdiction. Without such data, it is impossible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on some form of reported data, we can consider the plausibility:

1. **General Trends in Acquittal Rates**: In many jurisdictions, acquittal rates tend to be quite low but rarely as low as 1 out of 18,000 cases. This would imply an extraordinarily low acquittal rate of approximately 0.0056%.

2. **Reasonableness Check**: Such an extremely low acquittal rate is typically uncommon and might indicate a highly unusual situation or a misreporting of data.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, and considering the general trends in acquittal rates, it seems reasonable to suspect that the claim may be an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual data.

"""Transparency International"" speaks for thousands of people, more than 7,000 people ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""Transparency International speaks for thousands of people, more than 7,000 people,"" we need to consider the context and the organization's reach.

Transparency International is a global coalition against corruption, and it operates through national chapters and individual members around the world. The organization does have a significant global presence and influences many people through its advocacy, research, and campaigns.

However, the claim specifically mentions ""speaks for more than 7,000 people."" This phrasing could be interpreted in different ways. If it means that the organization has more than 7,000 members or supporters, it might be accurate. But if it implies that the organization directly represents the voices of more than 7,000 people in a formal sense, it might be overstating its direct representational capacity.

Without specific data on the number of members or people directly represented by Transparency International, it's challenging to confirm the exact number. Given the organization's global influence and the likelihood that it has a large number of supporters, the claim is likely to have some truth but may not be entirely accurate in a literal sense.

Without additional context or evidence, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the structure and content of the statement, it appears to be a fragmented and incomplete sentence. It lacks clarity and does not provide sufficient details to determine its truthfulness.

Given the lack of context and the incomplete nature of the statement, it is reasonable to consider the claim as 'Half True' at best, as it could be partially accurate but requires more information for a definitive assessment.

Without such information, it's not possible to accurately assess the claim.

However, if we assume the claim is based on some context or data that indicates a specific entity (referred to as 'one white') in Tkibuli did not allocate funds for playground rehabilitation, we can hypothetically analyze it.

If the claim is backed by verifiable evidence showing that the entity did not spend on playground rehabilitation, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True.' If there is partial evidence or conflicting information, it might be 'Half True.' If there is strong evidence to the contrary, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

"“For more than 20 years, Georgia's economy has been stagnated instead of development.What an argument ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""For more than 20 years, Georgia's economy has been stagnated instead of development,"" we need to consider the economic indicators and trends in Georgia over the past two decades.

1. **Economic Growth**: Georgia has experienced periods of economic growth and development over the past 20 years. For example, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia went through significant economic reforms and has seen growth in various sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and services.

2. **GDP and Inflation**: Georgia's GDP has shown positive growth rates in many years over the past two decades. While there have been periods of slower growth and economic challenges, the overall trend has not been one of complete stagnation.

3. **Investments and Reforms**: Georgia has attracted foreign direct investment and implemented economic reforms aimed at modernizing its economy. These efforts have led to improvements in infrastructure, business environment, and overall economic conditions.

4. **Challenges**: Despite progress, Georgia has faced economic challenges, including political instability, conflicts, and external economic shocks. However, these challenges do not necessarily indicate a complete stagnation of the economy.

Based on the available data and economic trends, the claim that Georgia's economy has been stagnated for more than 20 years is an overstatement. While there have been periods of slower growth and challenges, there have also been periods of development and progress.

Reduction of remuneration moves on the shoulders of Georgian soldiers,half true,ka,"To accurately assess the claim, we need more context and specific details. However, as a general approach, if the statement suggests that the financial burden of reducing remuneration is directly affecting Georgian soldiers, we would need to evaluate the following:

1. **Evidence**: Are there documented reports or official statements indicating that the remuneration of Georgian soldiers has been reduced?
2. **Scope**: Does the reduction specifically affect soldiers, or is it part of a broader economic policy affecting other sectors as well?
3. **Impact**: What is the actual impact on the soldiers? Are they facing significant financial hardship as a result?

Without specific evidence, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is based on credible reports and the reduction primarily affects soldiers, it could be categorized as follows:

- **True**: If there is clear, uncontested evidence that the remuneration of Georgian soldiers has been reduced and this reduction is specifically targeted at them.
- **Mostly True**: If the reduction affects soldiers but also includes other groups, with soldiers being the primary target.
- **Half True**: If the reduction affects soldiers but is part of a broader policy affecting many groups equally.
- **Mostly False**: If the reduction affects many groups, but soldiers are not the primary target.
- **False**: If there is no evidence of any reduction in remuneration for soldiers.

Given the lack of specific evidence in the provided statement, a balanced assessment would be:

Applying from the pension scheme is practically minimized ..."", we need more context and specific details regarding the pension reform in question. Without additional information, it's challenging to determine the veracity of the statement.

However, generally, if a claim suggests that pension reform has significantly reduced the need to apply for a pension scheme, it would require evidence showing that the reform has indeed made the application process simpler or less necessary.

Without such evidence, the claim appears to be speculative or exaggerated. Therefore, based on the lack of specific details and evidence provided, the claim seems to be:

Without specific context or evidence, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on known public statements or writings by Giorgi Gachechiladze, and there is evidence supporting this, the claim could be considered accurate. If there is no such evidence, the claim would be less accurate.

We have a very large shortage of electricity that grows every year,mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""We have a very large shortage of electricity that grows every year,"" we need to consider global data on electricity supply and demand.

As of recent years, many countries have indeed faced electricity shortages, particularly during peak demand periods. However, the situation varies greatly by region. Some countries have reliable electricity supply, while others struggle with significant shortages. Additionally, the growth rate of electricity demand can outpace the growth in supply in many developing nations, leading to increasing shortages.

However, it is not accurate to say that there is a universal and growing shortage of electricity worldwide. Many developed countries have stable or even surplus electricity supply, and improvements in renewable energy and grid efficiency are continually working to address shortages in other regions.

Given this nuanced picture, the claim is not entirely false but is also not entirely true. It is more accurate to describe it as having elements of truth but not capturing the full complexity of the global electricity situation.

1. **Insurance Amount**: The claim states ""more than 160 million in agro insurance."" Without specific context or a unit (e.g., dollars, euros), it's challenging to verify the accuracy of this figure. We'll assume it refers to a currency unit.

2. **Crop Protection**: The claim asserts that ""80-90% of the crop is protected from hail."" This is a specific and measurable assertion. To evaluate its truthfulness, we would typically look for supporting data or expert opinions.

Given the lack of specific context or verifiable data, we can only make a general assessment:

- If the insurance amount is accurate and the percentage of crop protection is within the stated range, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True.'
- If there are significant inaccuracies in either the insurance amount or the percentage of crop protection, the claim could be 'Mostly False.'
- If the claim is somewhere in between, with some truth but also significant inaccuracies or lack of context, it could be 'Half True.'

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of this claim. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the general principles involved in such claims:

1. **Context and Specifics**: The claim lacks specific details about what tariff was reduced, the mechanisms by which the savings were achieved, and how the savings were calculated.
2. **Evidence and Sources**: Typically, claims about economic savings should be backed by data from reputable sources, such as government reports, economic analyses, or independent audits.
3. **Plausibility**: While it is plausible that reducing tariffs could lead to savings, the exact amount and impact would depend on various factors, including the nature of the tariff, the size of the population, and the economic conditions at the time.

Per capita GDP is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its population. While it is possible that per capita GDP has been increasing in some contexts, the claim that it has ""not stopped"" increasing and that people are not paying attention to this fact is a broad statement that requires empirical data for verification.

Without specific data or a time frame, it is difficult to definitively label this claim as entirely true or false. However, economic trends are often complex and can vary significantly across different regions and time periods. Therefore, a general statement like this is likely to be partially accurate but not universally true.

Without specific data or context provided, I'll break down the statement logically:

1. **Investments have not increased**: This claim suggests that there has been no significant rise in investments post-amendment. To verify this, one would need to look at investment figures before and after the amendment.

2. **Trade has not increased except exports**: This implies that overall trade has remained stagnant or decreased, except for an increase in exports. Again, trade data before and after the amendment would be necessary to confirm this.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, the claim appears to be a mix of potentially verifiable statements. It implies some changes (increase in exports) while asserting a lack of change in other areas (investments and overall trade).

However, based on the information provided, the claim suggests that the National Movement was not in power for nine years and that many things related to infrastructure were not done during that period.

Without additional context or data, it is challenging to definitively label the claim. However, if we take the statement at face value and assume that it is discussing a specific political movement that was out of power for nine years and that infrastructure progress was lacking during that time, we can make a general assessment.

In international assessments all reforms of Georgia and the course spent by the authorities are endorsed,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""In international assessments all reforms of Georgia and the course spent by the authorities are endorsed,"" we need to consider the general consensus of international assessments on Georgia's reforms.

International assessments often provide a mixed picture rather than a uniform endorsement. For example, organizations like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and European Union (EU) may praise certain economic and governance reforms in Georgia, such as progress in anti-corruption efforts and economic liberalization. However, they also frequently highlight areas where more work is needed, such as judicial independence, media freedom, and minority rights.

Given this context, the claim that all reforms and the course taken by the authorities are endorsed in international assessments is an overstatement. While there may be recognition and endorsement of certain reforms, it is not accurate to say that all reforms and the entire course have been universally endorsed.

Our attitudes on the money received from Russia are reduced,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim 'Our attitudes on the money received from Russia are reduced', we need more context. The claim is ambiguous and lacks specific details that would allow for a concrete assessment. Without additional information, it's challenging to determine its veracity. However, based on the phrasing alone, it seems to imply a change in attitudes, which could be subjective and vary depending on the perspective and the data being considered.

Given the lack of specific details and the subjective nature of the claim, a reasonable assessment would be:

"According to the two quarters, the budget is exceeded and the failure is virtually not observed",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""According to the two quarters, the budget is exceeded.""
2. ""The failure is virtually not observed.""

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of these statements. However, based on the general phrasing, here's an analysis:

1. If the budget is exceeded in two quarters, this is a clear and measurable claim that can be verified with financial records.
2. The claim that ""failure is virtually not observed"" is more subjective and depends on what is defined as a failure and how it is measured.

Given the lack of specific context or data, a general interpretation would suggest that the claim might have elements of truth but also some ambiguity or potential inaccuracies.

Georgia's data in the Global Competitiveness Index improved by 7 positions.138 countries ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that 'Georgia's data in the Global Competitiveness Index improved by 7 positions,' we need to compare this statement with reliable sources or reports that provide Georgia's ranking in the Global Competitiveness Index over the relevant years.

Without access to the specific data or reports, I cannot verify the claim directly. However, let's consider the general approach to evaluating such a claim:

1. **Identify the Source**: Check if the claim comes from a reputable source, such as the World Economic Forum, which publishes the Global Competitiveness Index.
2. **Compare Rankings**: Look at the rankings of Georgia from the previous year and the current year to see if there is indeed a 7-position improvement.
3. **Cross-Reference**: Verify the information with other reliable sources or official reports.

Given that I cannot access external data or verify the information in real-time, I will provide a hypothetical evaluation based on typical scenarios:

- **True**: If the official reports show that Georgia's ranking improved by exactly 7 positions.
- **Mostly True**: If the improvement is close to 7 positions, such as 6 or 8 positions.
- **Half True**: If there is an improvement, but it is not close to 7 positions (e.g., 4 positions).
- **Mostly False**: If there is little to no improvement or the improvement is significantly different from 7 positions.
- **False**: If there is no improvement or the data contradicts the claim entirely.

Since I cannot verify the specific data, I will provide a general hypothetical answer:

**Final Answer: Mostly True**

This hypothetical answer assumes that the improvement is close to 7 positions but may not be exactly 7. For an accurate evaluation, one would need to refer to the official Global Competitiveness Index reports.",,False,True
"In terms of security, Georgia is one of the leading positions in different rankings",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""In terms of security, Georgia is one of the leading positions in different rankings,"" we need to consider various security indices and rankings. Georgia, particularly the country in the Caucasus region, has made significant strides in enhancing its security over the years. However, whether it is consistently among the top positions in global security rankings can vary depending on the specific indices and rankings being considered.

For instance, the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index, the Global Peace Index, and other similar rankings provide insights into a country's security situation. Georgia has indeed improved its standing in many of these rankings, often being cited for its progress in areas like rule of law and public safety. However, it may not always be at the very top of these rankings when compared to countries with long-established security infrastructures and low crime rates.

Given these considerations, the claim that Georgia is one of the leading positions in terms of security in different rankings is somewhat accurate but may not be entirely true across all measures. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
"“We have taken offices in all districts, we have lost budget funding, forbidden free TV ...",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **""We have taken offices in all districts""**: This statement suggests that a certain group or organization has established a presence in every district. To verify this, one would need specific data or evidence showing that the group has indeed set up offices in all districts.

2. **""We have lost budget funding""**: This implies that the group has lost financial support from a budget. Verification would require evidence of the budget allocation and any changes that resulted in loss of funding.

3. **""Forbidden free TV""**: This statement suggests that the group has been denied access to free television broadcasting. Verification would involve checking regulations or official statements regarding access to TV broadcasting.

Without specific context or evidence for each component, it's challenging to definitively confirm or deny the entire claim. Therefore, based on the lack of verifiable details, the claim can be considered:

Without additional context or reliable sources to verify the numbers provided, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, the statement is not entirely clear and coherent due to language mixing and potential translation issues.

To evaluate the claim, we need to focus on the key points:
1. Turkey's self-sufficiency in livestock and meat production.
2. Turkey's ability to export live animals and meat.
3. The mention of potential import needs.

Without additional context or specific data to verify these claims, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the general information available, Turkey is known for its agricultural sector and has been expanding its exports in various areas, including livestock and meat. The mention of potential imports suggests that there may be instances where self-sufficiency is not fully achieved.

The claim suggests that people in Telavi pay more for a limited supply of water (2 hours per day) compared to Tbilisi residents who have access to water for 24 hours a day.

Without specific data on water costs and availability in both cities, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if Telavi residents indeed pay more for limited water access while Tbilisi residents pay less for continuous access, the claim leans towards being accurate.

"Adjara's 2012 budget was 131 million, now is 236 million, growth 57%",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to check the mathematical accuracy of the growth percentage stated.

The claim states that Adjara's budget grew from 131 million to 236 million, which is a growth of 57%.

First, calculate the growth:
\[ \text{Growth} = \text{New Budget} - \text{Old Budget} \]
\[ \text{Growth} = 236 \text{ million} - 131 \text{ million} \]
\[ \text{Growth} = 105 \text{ million} \]

Next, calculate the percentage growth:
\[ \text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{\text{Growth}}{\text{Old Budget}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{105 \text{ million}}{131 \text{ million}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Growth} \approx 80.15\% \]

The actual percentage growth is approximately 80.15%, not 57%.

"A financial amnesty was announced on January 1, 2005",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""A financial amnesty was announced on January 1, 2005,"" we need to verify if any such announcement was made on that specific date.

Without access to real-time databases or specific historical records, we can rely on general knowledge and widely available information. Financial amnesties or tax amnesties are typically significant events that would be well-documented in financial and governmental records. If such an amnesty was announced on January 1, 2005, it would likely be referenced in news articles, government publications, or financial reports from that time.

However, there is no widely known or documented financial amnesty announced on January 1, 2005, that is commonly cited in historical or financial records. Therefore, without specific evidence to support the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is false.

Without additional context or verification from a reliable source, it is difficult to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the information given, the claim seems specific and potentially verifiable. If the figures are accurate and from a reliable source, the claim could be considered true or mostly true.

If the figures are exaggerated or inaccurate, the claim could be considered mostly false or false.

Without additional context or evidence, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of this claim.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have conducted a thorough investigation and found the following:

1. There are indeed 12 current projects in the Hero's Alley.
2. The total value of these projects is close to, but slightly less than, 600 million GEL.

Given this hypothetical information, the claim would be considered ""Mostly True"" because the number of projects is accurate, and the total value is close to the stated amount but not exact.

Without additional context or data, I can only provide a general assessment based on common patterns in such claims.

If the claim refers to specific, verifiable projects or stages that were indeed underway during the mentioned periods, and if water issues are a known problem in Telavi, then the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'Half True', depending on the accuracy and completeness of the details.

However, if the claim lacks specific details or if the mentioned projects or stages are not widely recognized or verified, the claim could lean towards 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

"“We have the lowest taxes in the region, simplified border procedures, non -corruption ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""We have the lowest taxes in the region, simplified border procedures, non-corruption,"" we need to consider each part of the statement individually.

1. **Lowest taxes in the region**: This claim needs to be verified with data on tax rates across different regions. Without specific data, it's challenging to confirm or deny this part of the claim.

2. **Simplified border procedures**: This is subjective and depends on the perspective of those experiencing the border procedures. It could be true, but it requires evidence from multiple sources to confirm.

3. **Non-corruption**: Claiming absolute non-corruption is highly unlikely in any region. Most places have some level of corruption, even if it's low. This part of the claim is likely exaggerated.

However, generally speaking, if the claim is based on official data from a reputable source like Geostat, it is likely to be accurate unless there are specific reasons to doubt the data's integrity or the interpretation of the data.

Given that I cannot independently verify the data, I would cautiously rate the claim as follows:

**Final Answer: Mostly True**

Without access to official records or reliable sources, it is not possible to definitively assess the accuracy of the statement.

If you have access to official reports, government data, or independent verification, you can compare the numbers provided in the claim to the actual figures. If both the number of beneficiaries and the amount of money are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies but the overall claim is largely correct, it would be 'Mostly True'. If there are significant discrepancies or the claim is a mix of accurate and inaccurate information, it would be 'Half True'. If the claim is mostly inaccurate, it would be 'Mostly False'.

"“At the meeting of the Security Council, the ministers are obliged and forced to come, but the premier ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we need to consider the roles and obligations within a Security Council meeting. Typically, in many governmental structures, ministers are indeed obligated to attend Security Council meetings due to their critical roles in decision-making and policy implementation. However, the role of the premier (or prime minister) can vary depending on the specific governmental system and the context of the meeting.

In many parliamentary systems, the premier is the head of government and would be expected to attend key meetings, including those of the Security Council. However, the phrase ""the premier ...' is incomplete and does not specify whether the premier is obligated to attend or not. This ambiguity makes it difficult to categorize the statement as entirely true or false.

Given the information provided, the claim that ministers are obliged and forced to come to the meeting of the Security Council is accurate, but the incomplete statement about the premier introduces uncertainty.

We are the only country in the region that has free trade with both Europe and China,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""We are the only country in the region that has free trade with both Europe and China,"" we need to consider the context of the region in question and verify the trade agreements in place.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, several countries have free trade agreements with both the European Union (EU) and China. For example, Switzerland and Iceland are European countries that have free trade agreements with both the EU and China. Additionally, countries like Chile and Peru in South America have free trade agreements with both the EU and China.

Without specifying the region, it is difficult to definitively say that the claim is true or false. However, based on the known agreements, it is unlikely that any single country is the only one in its region with free trade agreements with both Europe and China.

All citizens of Georgia were 60%poor,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim 'All citizens of Georgia were 60% poor,' we need to consider the logical and factual aspects of the statement.

1. **Logical Evaluation**: The claim suggests that every single citizen in Georgia is 60% poor. The concept of being ""60% poor"" is not well-defined and doesn't align with standard measures of poverty, which are typically binary (a person is either below or above the poverty line).

2. **Factual Evaluation**: Poverty rates are usually reported as a percentage of the population, not as a percentage applied to each individual. For example, a valid statement might be ""60% of the citizens of Georgia are poor."" However, saying ""All citizens of Georgia were 60% poor"" is logically inconsistent and factually unsupported.

Given these considerations, the claim is not accurate and does not make sense in the context of conventional poverty measures.

"“Today, when each pensioner receives 150 GEL, he loses about 12 GEL per month, that is, a year d ...",false,ka,"The claim states that each pensioner who receives 150 GEL loses about 12 GEL per month, which amounts to a yearly loss. To evaluate this claim, we need to understand the context of the loss mentioned. If the loss is due to inflation or other economic factors, it would need to be substantiated with data on the rate of inflation or other relevant economic indicators.

Without specific data or context, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a loss due to inflation or similar economic factors, we can make an educated guess based on typical economic conditions.

For example, if the inflation rate is around 8% annually, a pensioner receiving 150 GEL per month would experience a decrease in the purchasing power of their pension. To calculate the monthly loss due to inflation, we would use the following formula:

Monthly loss = Monthly pension * (Annual inflation rate / 12)

Using an 8% annual inflation rate:

Monthly loss = 150 GEL * (0.08 / 12) = 150 GEL * 0.006667 ≈ 1 GEL

This calculation shows a monthly loss of approximately 1 GEL, not 12 GEL. Therefore, the claim that a pensioner loses about 12 GEL per month seems exaggerated based on typical economic conditions.

However, if the claim is based on verifiable facts and widely accepted reports or studies conducted during the previous parliamentary elections, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the claim is partially accurate but contains some inaccuracies or omissions, it might be 'Half True'. If the claim is largely inaccurate or misleading, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without this data, we cannot definitively determine the truth value of the statement. However, based on the information provided, the claim appears to be asserting that Rustavi 2 covered only two murders in both August 2011 and August 2014, despite there being 11 murders in August 2011.

Since the claim lacks specific details and context, such as the total number of murders in August 2014 and the exact coverage by Rustavi 2, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully substantiated and appears to be a generalized statement without sufficient evidence.

"The Georgian Dream claimed that all IDPs would be satisfied with apartments in the first election, though ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Georgian Dream claimed that all IDPs would be satisfied with apartments in the first election,"" we need to examine the context and the actual statements made by the Georgian Dream during their first election campaign.

The Georgian Dream party, led by Bidzina Ivanishvili, made various promises during their first election campaign in 2012. One of their significant promises was to address the housing needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who had been affected by conflicts in Georgia. However, the specific claim that ""all IDPs would be satisfied with apartments"" suggests a definitive and complete resolution of the housing issue for all IDPs, which is a high bar to meet.

Upon reviewing the available information and the political rhetoric from that time, it is clear that the Georgian Dream made promises to improve the living conditions of IDPs and provide housing solutions. However, the claim that ""all IDPs would be satisfied with apartments"" implies a guarantee that every single IDP would receive an apartment, which is a more ambitious statement than what was generally promised.

Given the complexity and the scale of the IDP housing issue, it is unlikely that any political party could guarantee satisfaction for every single IDP in a short period. Therefore, the claim that all IDPs would be satisfied with apartments is an overstatement.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have evaluated the claim based on available data and expert analysis. Here is a hypothetical breakdown:

1. **True**: If there is a clear and official announcement or legislation that confirms a 17 percent salary increase for teachers.
2. **Mostly True**: If the increase is close to 17 percent but not exactly (e.g., 16 percent or 18 percent), or if the increase applies to most but not all teachers.
3. **Half True**: If the increase is significantly different from 17 percent (e.g., 10 percent) or if the increase applies only to a subset of teachers.
4. **Mostly False**: If the increase is much lower than 17 percent (e.g., 5 percent) or if the claim is largely unfounded but contains a small element of truth.
5. **False**: If there is no planned salary increase for teachers or if the increase is completely different from the claimed 17 percent.

Given the lack of specific context in the prompt, let's assume a hypothetical evaluation suggests that the claim is somewhat accurate but not entirely precise:

**Final Answer: Mostly True**",mostly true,False,False
"In Georgia, extreme poverty has increased in all categories of population",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""In Georgia, extreme poverty has increased in all categories of population,"" we need to examine recent data and reports on poverty levels in Georgia.

As of the latest available data from sources like the World Bank, national statistics agencies, and international organizations, there is no evidence to suggest that extreme poverty has increased across all categories of the population in Georgia. In fact, many reports indicate that poverty rates have been decreasing over the past decade due to economic growth and social programs.

For example, according to the World Bank, the poverty rate in Georgia has been declining. While there may be fluctuations and specific groups that still face significant challenges, the overall trend does not support a claim that extreme poverty has increased across all categories.

Therefore, based on the available data, the claim is not accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The loss of profit tax has been reduced by government administrative costs and excise tax ...,half true,ka,"The claim 'The loss of profit tax has been reduced by government administrative costs and excise tax ...' requires specific context and data to evaluate accurately. Without detailed information on the specific government, the time frame, and the exact policies in place, it is difficult to verify the truthfulness of the statement. Generally, government administrative costs and excise taxes can indeed affect overall profitability, but whether they directly reduce a ""loss of profit tax"" would depend on the specific tax laws and financial mechanisms at play.

Given the lack of specific context, a general assessment would be:

**Final Answer:** Half True",half true,True,False
"During the construction of the Samtredia-Grigoleti section of the highway, the Ukrainian company is around 45 ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to assess the involvement of a Ukrainian company in the construction of the Samtredia-Grigoleti section of the highway. Without specific details or context, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the statement. However, based on the information provided, the claim suggests partial involvement of a Ukrainian company.

If the Ukrainian company is indeed involved, but the extent of their involvement is not specified, the claim could be considered partially accurate.

"In 2012, 11 million were spent on City Hall and Ips in Kutaisi, and today 19 million are spent on",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the amount spent on City Hall and Ips in Kutaisi in 2012 and the current amount being spent. Without access to specific data or sources, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. However, if you provide sources or more context, I can assist you in evaluating the claim.

For the sake of argument, let's assume the claim is being assessed based on available public records or official statements. If there is evidence that supports the amounts mentioned, the claim would be considered accurate. If there is partial evidence or discrepancies, it would be considered 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'. If there is no supporting evidence, it would be considered 'False'.

"In Georgia, 11,400 people die each year with tobacco diseases ... tobacco ...",true,ka,"To verify the claim that ""In Georgia, 11,400 people die each year with tobacco diseases,"" we need to refer to reliable sources such as official health reports or government statistics.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. While the CDC provides state-specific data on tobacco-related deaths, the exact number for Georgia may vary slightly depending on the source and year of the report.

Recent data from sources like the CDC or the Georgia Department of Public Health suggest that the number of tobacco-related deaths in Georgia is indeed significant and aligns with the claim. However, without an exact citation, we cannot confirm the precise figure of 11,400 deaths.

Based on available data and general consensus, the claim is likely accurate but may not be exact. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Georgia's rating has deteriorated at Doing Business due to the new research methodology,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""'Georgia's rating has deteriorated at Doing Business due to the new research methodology,'"" we need to consider the context and the evidence available. The ""Doing Business"" report by the World Bank has undergone methodological changes over the years, which can affect the rankings of countries. If Georgia's rating has indeed declined and this decline can be attributed to changes in the methodology rather than a decline in the actual business environment, then the claim would be true or mostly true.

Without specific data or evidence to support the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if the claim aligns with known changes in methodology and the observed decline in Georgia's rating, it is plausible that the claim is accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"“To finish the topic of bonuses ... Last year the ministers' salary was 6 300 GEL, I was in January ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to know the context and the actual salary of the ministers last year. Without specific data on the ministers' salaries for the mentioned period, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the statement.

However, assuming the statement is based on verifiable data, here's a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. **True**: If the ministers' salary was exactly 6,300 GEL last year and the speaker was indeed in January.
2. **Mostly True**: If the salary was close to 6,300 GEL and the speaker was in January, but there might be minor discrepancies.
3. **Half True**: If the salary was somewhat different from 6,300 GEL or there is uncertainty about the timing of the speaker's presence.
4. **Mostly False**: If the salary was significantly different from 6,300 GEL or the timing is incorrect.
5. **False**: If the ministers' salary was not 6,300 GEL last year and the speaker was not in January.

Without specific data, we cannot provide a definitive answer. If you have access to the actual salary figures and the timing, you can determine the accuracy of the claim.

The result of our reform is that the International Monetary Fund estimates that Georgia is a successful tax ...,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""the International Monetary Fund estimates that Georgia is a successful tax ..."", we would need more context and specific data from the IMF. Without additional information, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim definitively. However, if the IMF has indeed made such an estimate, the claim could be considered true or mostly true. If the claim is exaggerated or misrepresents the IMF's findings, it might be considered half true, mostly false, or false.

Adjara Roads Department of Ajara Roads 2 million tender two years ago reconstructed road ...,true,ka,"The claim you've provided contains insufficient context and broken phrasing, making it difficult to verify accurately. However, based on the information provided, it appears to suggest that the Adjara Roads Department reconstructed a road two years ago with a tender of 2 million. Without specific details or additional context, it's challenging to determine the veracity of this claim.

Given the lack of clarity and context:

"In 2012, the number of employees in the public sector was 273,000, which was the Dream coming to power ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need more context and specific data. The statement mentions the number of employees in the public sector in 2012 but does not provide a clear comparison or context for ""the Dream coming to power."" Without additional information on what ""the Dream"" refers to and the public sector employee numbers before and after 2012, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim.

However, based on the incomplete information provided, we can only consider the absolute number given. If we assume that ""the Dream coming to power"" is a reference to a political event or administration change that should have an impact on public sector employment, we would need to know the figures before and after this event to make a proper judgment.

Given the lack of context and comparative data, the claim cannot be fully verified. Therefore, the best assessment without additional information is:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"GEL 2 billion in water, the growth rate of agriculture is reduced",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""'GEL 2 billion in water, the growth rate of agriculture is reduced,"" we need context and additional information about the relationship between the investment in water resources and the agricultural growth rate. Without specific data or a detailed explanation of the mechanisms at play, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment.

However, generally speaking, investing in water resources can have various impacts on agriculture, including improvements in irrigation systems, water management, and crop yields, which could potentially increase agricultural productivity rather than reduce it. Therefore, without further context or evidence, the claim seems counterintuitive.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"This year we gave the Ministry of Infrastructure 20%more budget and according to 6 months, more than 100%...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two parts:

1. ""This year we gave the Ministry of Infrastructure 20% more budget""
2. ""According to 6 months, more than 100%...""

The first part of the claim is specific and can be verified with data on the allocated budget. The second part, however, is incomplete and ambiguous. It's unclear what ""more than 100%"" refers to (e.g., spending, completion of projects, etc.). Without additional context or data, it's impossible to accurately fact-check this part of the claim.

Given the lack of clarity in the second part of the claim, we cannot confidently label the entire statement as 'True' or 'Mostly True'. Therefore, the most accurate assessment based on the available information is:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False

The Ministry of Refugees has lent a mortgage loan to about 100 IDP families,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify it with reliable sources or official statements from the Ministry of Refugees. Since I don't have real-time data access or specific context about the Ministry of Refugees in question, I can't definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, I can provide guidance on how to evaluate such claims:

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look for press releases, reports, or statements from the Ministry of Refugees.
2. **Media Reports**: Verify through credible news outlets that may have covered the story.
3. **Cross-Referencing**: Compare the information with data from other government agencies or NGOs involved in refugee affairs.

Without specific verification, the claim cannot be accurately classified. If you have additional context or sources, please provide them for a more precise evaluation.

"50,000 inhabitants from the highlands of Adjara ... Mountain can no longer bear, Khulo population 35-36a ...",half true,ka,"To assess the claim, we need to evaluate the accuracy of the statements regarding the population of the highlands of Adjara and Khulo specifically.

1. **50,000 inhabitants from the highlands of Adjara**: This statement suggests that there are 50,000 inhabitants in the highlands of Adjara. Without specific current data, it's challenging to verify this number precisely. However, the highlands of Adjara are known to have a significant population, and while 50,000 might be an overestimation, it could be within a reasonable range.

2. **Khulo population 35-36a**: This statement suggests that Khulo has a population of 35-36,000. According to recent data, Khulo Municipality has a population closer to 23,000-25,000. This discrepancy indicates that the claim is significantly overstated.

Given the inaccuracy in the population figures for Khulo, the overall claim leans towards being false or mostly false.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
The depreciation of the GEL is due to the fact that the import is very increased,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The depreciation of the GEL is due to the fact that the import is very increased,"" we need to consider the economic factors that affect the value of a currency.

Currency depreciation can be influenced by several factors, including:
1. **Trade Balance**: High imports relative to exports can lead to a trade deficit, which can put downward pressure on the currency.
2. **Inflation**: Higher inflation rates can lead to currency depreciation.
3. **Interest Rates**: Lower interest rates can make a currency less attractive to investors.
4. **Economic Policies and Stability**: Political and economic stability, as well as government policies, can impact currency value.
5. **Speculation and Market Sentiment**: Investor confidence and market speculation can also affect currency value.

While high imports can contribute to currency depreciation, it is not the sole factor. Other economic indicators and market dynamics also play significant roles. Therefore, the claim is partially true but oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors that contribute to currency depreciation.

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
Railway freight is increased,false,ka,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim ""Railway freight is increased,"" we need to look at recent data trends in railway freight transportation. Without specific data or a timeframe, it's difficult to give a precise answer. However, I can provide a general response based on typical patterns.

**Analysis:**

1. **True**: This would imply a definitive increase in railway freight across all regions and timeframes, which is difficult to claim without specific data.
2. **Mostly True**: This suggests a significant increase in most cases, but there might be some exceptions.
3. **Half True**: This indicates that while there may be an increase in some areas or time periods, there are also instances where it is not the case.
4. **Mostly False**: This suggests that while there might be some increase, the overall trend does not support a general increase.
5. **False**: This would imply no increase or even a decrease in railway freight.

Without specific data, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer, but based on general economic trends and reports, railway freight often fluctuates with economic activity. There might be periods of increase and decrease depending on various factors such as economic conditions, policy changes, and global trade dynamics.

“The Prime Minister of Georgia has said clearly that it is acceptable to him the way to Serbia Kos ...,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim effectively, more context and specific details about the statement made by the Prime Minister of Georgia regarding Serbia and Kosovo are required. Without this context, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, if we assume the claim is accurately reflecting a statement made by the Prime Minister of Georgia, here's how we might assess it:

1. **True**: The Prime Minister of Georgia has explicitly stated that a certain path to Serbia and Kosovo is acceptable.
2. **Mostly True**: The Prime Minister has made a statement that generally aligns with the claim but may have some minor inaccuracies or omissions.
3. **Half True**: The statement contains elements of truth but also significant inaccuracies or omissions.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim contains some truth but is largely inaccurate or misleading.
5. **False**: The Prime Minister of Georgia has not made such a statement.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim, it's difficult to assign a definitive category without more information. However, for the sake of providing an answer based on the limited information:

This assessment assumes that the Prime Minister may have made a statement that could be interpreted in this way, but without further details, we cannot confirm the full accuracy or context of the claim.",,False,True
Georgia is the only country in the region whose economy will grow,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Georgia is the only country in the region whose economy will grow,"" we need to consider the context and available economic data for the region. The term ""region"" could refer to various geographical areas, such as the Caucasus, Eastern Europe, or even broader definitions. Without specific data or a timeframe, it's challenging to definitively label the claim. However, economic growth projections often vary among countries, and it's unlikely that Georgia would be the sole country experiencing growth. Therefore, without concrete evidence to support the exclusivity of Georgia's economic growth, the claim seems overstated.

"Tbilisi City Hall does not spend money, it is 140 million, it is transferred to the remains",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""'Tbilisi City Hall does not spend money, it is 140 million, it is transferred to the remains,'"" we need more context and specific details to make an accurate judgment. The claim suggests that Tbilisi City Hall has 140 million in unspent funds, but without additional information on the source of the funds, the intended spending, or the fiscal policies, it's challenging to determine the truthfulness of the statement.

However, based on the phrasing and the lack of specific details, the claim seems to be a broad and potentially misleading statement. It does not provide enough context to verify its accuracy. Therefore, without additional information, the claim can be considered:

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
Creating new fractions of the Georgian Dream in Parliament will not result in additional costs,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Creating new fractions of the Georgian Dream in Parliament will not result in additional costs,"" we need to consider the possible financial implications of such a political move.

1. **Administrative Costs**: Creating new fractions within a political party in parliament might involve administrative tasks such as paperwork, registration, and potentially additional staff to manage these new factions.

2. **Operational Costs**: Additional factions might necessitate more resources for meetings, coordination, and potentially separate offices or meeting spaces.

3. **Legislative Costs**: If the new factions require separate budget allocations or additional resources for their legislative activities, this could also incur costs.

Given these considerations, it is unlikely that creating new fractions within the Georgian Dream would result in no additional costs. While the costs might not be substantial, they are unlikely to be zero.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
“GDP decline [decrease in real growth rate] began in the summer of 2012.He has repeatedly said this ...,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""GDP decline [decrease in real growth rate] began in the summer of 2012,"" we need to look at official economic data for that period.

If we refer to historical GDP data, we can check the quarterly or monthly real GDP growth rates for 2012. According to common economic sources such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the United States, the real GDP growth rate in the summer of 2012 (specifically, the second and third quarters) did not indicate a decline. Instead, the growth rate was positive, albeit at a slower pace compared to previous periods.

Given this information, the claim that the GDP decline began in the summer of 2012 is not accurate. The growth rate may have been lower, but it did not turn negative, which is typically what is implied by a ""decline"" in GDP.

"Before coming to power in power, 49% of Georgia's population lived beyond poverty, now ...",mostly false,ka,"To accurately determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Georgia's poverty rate before and after a specific administration, we would need:

1. The exact time period being referenced.
2. Reliable data sources such as official government statistics, reports from international organizations like the World Bank or the United Nations, or credible economic research studies.

Without specific data, it is challenging to definitively state the accuracy of the claim. However, general trends and historical data can provide some context. For example, Georgia has undergone significant economic reforms and has seen some reduction in poverty rates over the past few decades, but the specific figures would need to be verified for the precise period in question.

Given the lack of specific data in the claim, it is difficult to categorize it definitively without further information. Therefore, a cautious approach would be to classify it as:

It is a gross interference in parliamentary activity when the president dictates [veto format] what is going on in the law ...,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the roles of the president and the parliament (or legislature) in a democratic system. In many democracies, the president often has the power to veto legislation, which can be seen as a check on the legislative branch. However, this power is typically balanced by the ability of the legislature to override the veto with a supermajority vote.

The claim suggests that the president's use of the veto power is a ""gross interference"" in parliamentary activity. This is a subjective interpretation, as the veto power is a constitutional mechanism designed to ensure balance between the executive and legislative branches. It is not an interference in the strict sense but rather a part of the system of checks and balances.

Given this context, the claim is not entirely accurate but does contain a kernel of truth regarding the potential impact of the veto power.

Without additional information about the economic conditions, cost of living, and family income in the village, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment.

However, if we assume that the claim refers to the inadequacy of 57 GEL (Georgian Lari) to support a family's living expenses, we can infer that the claim is likely exaggerated or not fully accurate without supporting evidence.

Without specific data on the size of the Kutaisi center compared to others, it's challenging to definitively label the claim.

However, if the claim is based on recent announcements or plans that have been publicly verified, it could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'True.' If there is no substantial evidence or if other centers are known to be larger, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

However, Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is a more commonly cited source for country rankings on corruption.

As of my last update in October 2023, let's assume the claim is referring to the most recent available data from a reliable source like Transparency International's CPI.

- The initial number of children not attending school was 30,000.
- This number was reduced to 6,000 over two years.

If the numbers provided are accurate, this represents a significant reduction. However, without external verification, we can only judge the internal consistency and plausibility of the claim.

"You have increased administrative costs by 685 million GEL, which you have come to power.During the previous government the number of states was 101 thousand and in 2018 there were 116 thousand",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two main parts:

1. The increase in administrative costs by 685 million GEL since the current government came to power.
2. The increase in the number of state employees from 101 thousand during the previous government to 116 thousand in 2018.

Without specific data to verify these numbers, we can only analyze the structure and plausibility of the claim. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Administrative Costs Increase**: The claim mentions a specific increase of 685 million GEL in administrative costs. To verify this, one would need access to government budget reports or financial statements from the relevant periods.

2. **Number of State Employees**: The claim states that the number of state employees increased from 101 thousand to 116 thousand. This can be verified through official government employment records or census data.

In Ukraine the Orthodox Church,false,ka,"The statement ""In Ukraine the Orthodox Church"" is broad and lacks specificity, making it difficult to assign a truth value without further context. If the claim is intended to imply that the Orthodox Church is present in Ukraine, then it is true, as the Orthodox Church indeed has a significant presence in Ukraine. However, if the claim is intended to imply that the Orthodox Church is the only religious institution in Ukraine, then it would be false, as Ukraine has a diverse religious landscape that includes other Christian denominations, as well as other religions.

"In Ukraine is strengthened, ruble is solid in Russia and the lari rate in Georgia is still falling",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the current economic conditions and currency trends in Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia.

1. **Ukraine**: The claim states that the currency in Ukraine is strengthening. This would mean the Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH) is appreciating against other currencies, particularly the US Dollar or Euro.

2. **Russia**: The claim states that the ruble is solid. This implies stability or appreciation of the Russian Ruble (RUB) against other currencies.

3. **Georgia**: The claim states that the lari rate is still falling. This suggests that the Georgian Lari (GEL) is depreciating against other currencies.

Without real-time data, it's challenging to provide an exact assessment. However, based on typical economic fluctuations and recent trends:

- The Ukrainian Hryvnia has been under pressure due to economic and political instability, making a significant strengthening less likely without specific positive developments.
- The Russian Ruble has shown resilience and even appreciation at times due to factors like oil prices and government interventions, but ""solid"" is a subjective term.
- The Georgian Lari has faced depreciation pressures due to various economic factors, so a continued fall is plausible.

Given these considerations, the claim appears to be a mix of potentially accurate and inaccurate statements. Therefore, the most fitting category would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
The salary in the regulatory commissions is 14-16 thousand GEL and its upper limit has not been established,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the salary ranges and whether an upper limit has been established. The claim states that the salary in the regulatory commissions is 14-16 thousand GEL and that its upper limit has not been established.

If the salary range of 14-16 thousand GEL is accurate but there is indeed an established upper limit, the claim would be partially true but misleading regarding the upper limit.

Without specific data or context, I can't definitively say whether the upper limit has been established. However, based on the information provided, the claim seems to mix accurate information (salary range) with potentially misleading information (upper limit not established).

"The situation in energy deteriorates, investments are reduced",mostly true,ka,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim ""The situation in energy deteriorates, investments are reduced,"" we would need to examine specific data and trends related to the energy sector. However, without access to real-time data or specific context, I can provide a general assessment based on common patterns and recent trends.

In recent years, there have been mixed signals in the energy sector. While there have been periods of reduced investment due to factors such as economic downturns and shifts towards renewable energy sources, there have also been periods of significant investment, especially in renewable energy technologies. The claim suggests a general deterioration and reduction in investments, which may not accurately reflect the varied and complex nature of the energy sector.

Given the lack of specific data, a balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Georgia's credit rating has improved,true,ka,"To accurately assess the claim ""Georgia's credit rating has improved,"" we need to consider recent reports from credible financial rating agencies such as Moody's, S&P Global, and Fitch Ratings. These agencies periodically review and update the credit ratings of countries, including Georgia.

If the latest reports from these agencies indicate that Georgia's credit rating has been upgraded or maintained at a higher level, then the claim would be closer to 'True' or 'Mostly True.' If the ratings have been downgraded or unchanged at a lower level, the claim would be closer to 'Mostly False' or 'False.' If there has been no significant change, the claim could be 'Half True.'

Given the lack of specific recent data in this response, I'll provide a general guideline:

**Final Answer: Half True** (assuming no significant recent change in Georgia's credit rating based on general knowledge). Please verify with the latest reports from financial rating agencies for the most accurate assessment.",,False,True

"Compared to 2006, Georgia has improved from the 100th to 6th place in the Doing Business rating ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the World Bank's Doing Business ratings for Georgia in 2006 and the most recent year available.

According to historical data from the World Bank's Doing Business reports:
- In 2006, Georgia was ranked 112th.
- In the most recent available reports, Georgia has indeed seen significant improvements, but as of the latest records, it has not reached the 6th place.

Given this information, the claim that Georgia has improved from the 100th to the 6th place in the Doing Business rating is not entirely accurate. Georgia has indeed improved significantly, but not to the extent claimed.

"According to the law, the budget should be presented by the Prime Minister in parliament, but Giorgi Kvirikashvili does not ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the legal requirements regarding the presentation of the budget in the context of the specific country's laws. Without specific information about the laws of the country in question, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, assuming the statement is based on known legal procedures, here is a general approach to evaluating the claim:

1. **True**: If the law explicitly states that the budget must be presented by the Prime Minister in parliament and Giorgi Kvirikashvili is not following this procedure.
2. **Mostly True**: If the law generally requires the Prime Minister to present the budget, but there might be exceptional circumstances or minor deviations that do not fully invalidate the claim.
3. **Half True**: If the law allows for some flexibility in who presents the budget, or if Giorgi Kvirikashvili has partially fulfilled the requirement but not fully.
4. **Mostly False**: If the law does not strictly require the Prime Minister to present the budget, or if Giorgi Kvirikashvili has mostly complied with the requirement but with minor discrepancies.
5. **False**: If the law does not require the Prime Minister to present the budget, or if Giorgi Kvirikashvili has fully complied with the legal requirements.

Given the lack of specific context or legal information, we cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate legal knowledge, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True' if the law indeed requires the Prime Minister to present the budget and Giorgi Kvirikashvili is not doing so.

**Final Answer: Mostly True** (assuming the claim is based on accurate legal knowledge and Giorgi Kvirikashvili is not fully complying with the legal requirement).",,False,True
New initiatives in the 2017 budget are not reflected in election legislation,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""New initiatives in the 2017 budget are not reflected in election legislation,"" we need to consider the relationship between budget initiatives and election legislation.

1. **Budget Initiatives**: These are new programs, policies, or funding allocations introduced in a government's budget for a particular year.
2. **Election Legislation**: This typically refers to laws and regulations that govern the conduct of elections.

The claim suggests that new initiatives proposed in the 2017 budget are not included or mentioned in election legislation. This could be interpreted in a few ways:

- **Separation of Functions**: Budget initiatives and election legislation serve different purposes. Budget initiatives deal with financial planning and resource allocation, while election legislation deals with the rules and procedures for conducting elections.
- **Timing and Scope**: It's possible that new initiatives in the budget may not need to be reflected in election legislation if they do not directly impact the conduct of elections.

Given that budget initiatives and election legislation are generally separate domains with different focuses, it is likely that new budget initiatives would not necessarily be reflected in election legislation unless they specifically relate to the conduct of elections.

Therefore, the claim that ""New initiatives in the 2017 budget are not reflected in election legislation"" is likely true under normal circumstances.

**Final Answer: True**",true,False,False
"Compared to the previous government, the economy is at least twice the pace increased in all directions",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we would need specific data on economic indicators for both the current and previous governments. Without such data, it's impossible to accurately determine the veracity of the statement. However, claims of such broad and significant economic improvements are often exaggerated. It is rare for a government to achieve a doubling of economic growth across all sectors compared to its predecessor.

Given the lack of specific data and the general tendency for such claims to be overstated, a conservative evaluation would place this claim as:

**Final Answer: Half True**

This assumes that there may have been some improvement, but it is unlikely to be as substantial as claimed across all economic directions.",,False,True
"With the decisions of the Mayor of Poti, the budget has a loss of hundreds of thousands of GEL",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""With the decisions of the Mayor of Poti, the budget has a loss of hundreds of thousands of GEL,"" we would need to examine the specific decisions made by the Mayor of Poti, the financial impact of those decisions, and any available data or reports that support or refute the claim.

Without access to detailed financial records, audits, or reports from the municipality of Poti, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted based on the information provided.

"Compared to 2012, the remuneration of the Ministry of Justice increased by GEL 20 million when ...",half true,ka,"To determine the validity of the claim, we would need to compare the remuneration figures of the Ministry of Justice for the specified years. Without access to the actual data, we cannot verify the claim directly. However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume we have the necessary information and proceed with an analysis.

1. **Identify the baseline remuneration for 2012.**
2. **Identify the remuneration for the comparative year mentioned in the claim.**
3. **Calculate the difference between the two figures.**
4. **Determine if the difference is GEL 20 million, as stated.**

If the difference is exactly GEL 20 million, the claim is 'True.' If the difference is close but not exact, the claim might be 'Mostly True.' If there is a significant discrepancy, the claim could be 'Half True,' 'Mostly False,' or 'False.'

Budget revenues are at a historic maximum,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Budget revenues are at a historic maximum,"" we would need to examine several factors, including the source of the data, the timeframe being considered, and whether the data has been adjusted for inflation or other economic indicators.

However, without specific data or context, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim can be considered:

This might include reports from the Ministry of Finance, state audit agencies, or other official sources that detail government expenditures.

Without access to the specific data, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. However, if such a claim were made in a public context, it would typically require substantiation through cited sources and comparative analysis.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the prompt, a cautious approach would be to assume that the claim cannot be fully verified without further information.

Upon reviewing available information, there is no widely recognized or documented report from Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International specifically mentioning Koba Narchemashvili in the context of torture in 2002. While both organizations have extensively reported on human rights abuses and torture globally, the specific claim about Koba Narchemashvili in 2002 does not appear to be supported by credible sources.

50% of our population lives in poverty,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""50% of our population lives in poverty,"" we need specific data about the population and poverty levels in the context you're referring to. Without such data, a general assessment can be made based on global trends and available information.

In many developed countries, the poverty rate is typically much lower than 50%. For example, in the United States, the poverty rate is generally around 10-15%. In developing countries, poverty rates can be higher, but even in these cases, a 50% poverty rate would be considered very high and not typical.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim that ""50% of our population lives in poverty"" is likely an exaggeration for most contexts. Therefore, the claim is likely false or mostly false.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"If you export tomatoes from Georgia to Turkey, you have 300% taxpay, and when tomatoes enter, the levy is ...",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the accuracy of the statement regarding the tax and levy on tomatoes exported from Georgia to Turkey.

Firstly, a 300% tax on exports is exceptionally high and not typical for trade agreements between countries. Such high tariffs are rarely imposed as they would significantly hinder trade.

Secondly, the claim mentions an additional levy when tomatoes enter Turkey, but it does not specify the amount or nature of this levy.

Without specific, verifiable data on the current trade agreements and tariffs between Georgia and Turkey for tomatoes, it is challenging to confirm the exact figures. However, a 300% tax is highly unusual and likely inaccurate.

Given the lack of specific details and the improbability of a 300% tax, the claim appears to be largely exaggerated.

"The share of loans in dollars is reduced to 58%, the government team successfully successfully the larization reform ...",half true,ka,"To accurately assess the claim, we need to evaluate the information provided and consider any context or additional data that might support or refute it. The claim states:

""The share of loans in dollars is reduced to 58%, the government team successfully successfully the larization reform ...""

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of this claim. However, based on the provided information alone, the claim appears to be making a specific assertion about the reduction of dollar-denominated loans and the success of a ""larization"" reform. If there is evidence from reliable sources that supports these specific figures and the success of the reform, the claim could be considered true or mostly true.

However, the claim is somewhat incomplete and lacks clarity, especially with the repetition of ""successfully successfully."" This repetition could indicate a typographical error or a lack of careful editing, which might cast some doubt on the overall credibility of the claim.

Given the lack of context and the ambiguity in the statement, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as ""Half True"" until more concrete evidence is provided to support the specific figures and the success of the reform.

"In 2014-2016 we have fully restored all kindergartens in Telavi, for which I am 400,000 GEL ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Scope of the restoration**: The claim mentions that ""all kindergartens in Telavi"" were fully restored.
2. **Time frame**: The restoration was completed between 2014 and 2016.
3. **Cost**: The claimant spent 400,000 GEL on the restoration.

Without specific data or documentation to verify the extent of the restoration, the time frame, and the cost, it's challenging to provide a definitive assessment. However, based on the information given, here's a breakdown:

- If all kindergartens in Telavi were indeed fully restored within the specified time frame and at the stated cost, the claim would be 'True'.
- If most of the kindergartens were restored, but not all, or if the cost was approximately 400,000 GEL but not exact, the claim might be 'Mostly True'.
- If only about half of the kindergartens were restored, or the cost was significantly different, the claim could be 'Half True'.
- If very few kindergartens were restored, or the cost was much higher or lower, the claim would be 'Mostly False'.
- If no kindergartens were restored, or the restoration did not occur during the specified time frame, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific evidence, the most conservative assessment would be:

However, since I cannot access real-time data or the internet, I'll provide a general guideline on how to approach this:

1. **Check Official Statements**: Look for official statements from the Georgian government or relevant ministries.
2. **News Reports**: Consult reputable news sources for any announcements or developments on this issue.
3. **International Reports**: Organizations monitoring the region, such as the United Nations or international media, may have reports on this.

Without specific real-time information, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on standard procedures for verifying claims:

Human rights are not violated in our penitentiary system ...,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""Human rights are not violated in our penitentiary system,"" it is essential to consider various reports and investigations from human rights organizations, government audits, and testimonies from inmates and their families.

Numerous reports from organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and even governmental bodies often document instances of overcrowding, inadequate healthcare, abuse, and other violations within penitentiary systems worldwide. These reports suggest that human rights violations do occur in many penitentiary systems.

While there may be efforts to improve conditions and uphold human rights in some systems, the prevalence of documented abuses and systemic issues indicates that the claim is not entirely accurate.

"On the elements of outside presidential elections, all organization reports are written",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""On the elements of outside presidential elections, all organization reports are written,"" we need to consider whether it is feasible or typical for all organizations to write reports on external presidential elections.

1. **Scope**: The term ""all organizations"" is very broad and includes a wide range of entities, from businesses and non-profits to government agencies and educational institutions.
2. **Relevance**: Not all organizations would have the mandate, resources, or interest to write reports on presidential elections, especially those that are ""outside"" their primary focus or geographical area.
3. **Feasibility**: It is highly unlikely that every organization, regardless of its nature or purpose, would write reports on elements of outside presidential elections.

Given these considerations, the claim is not realistic or accurate in its absolute form.

Kakha Kaladze arrived in Tkibuli and said that 17 blocks already have gas.None have,mostly true,ka,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to assess the statement ""Kakha Kaladze arrived in Tkibuli and said that 17 blocks already have gas. None have."" The claim presents two pieces of information:

1. Kakha Kaladze arrived in Tkibuli.
2. He said that 17 blocks already have gas, but in reality, none have.

Without specific evidence or data to verify whether the 17 blocks have gas or not, we can only analyze the logical consistency of the statement. If Kakha Kaladze indeed made the claim that 17 blocks have gas, and the reality is that none have gas, then the statement is logically consistent but factually inaccurate based on the information provided.

Given the lack of specific evidence to confirm or deny the presence of gas in the 17 blocks, the claim that ""none have"" contradicts the alleged statement by Kakha Kaladze. Therefore, the claim is likely false based on the information provided.

Without direct access to surveys, interviews, or official reports from the eco-migrants in Khelvachauri, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, based on general principles, such claims often have varying degrees of truth depending on the source and the methodology used to gather the information. If the claim is based on a reliable survey or study that shows a majority of eco-migrants are satisfied, it could be considered 'Mostly True'. If the claim is based on anecdotal evidence or a small sample size, it might be 'Half True'. If there is significant evidence that many eco-migrants are dissatisfied, it could be 'Mostly False'.

Without specific evidence, the most neutral and cautious evaluation would be:

"“Under the current law [on Georgian citizenship], you must first sign a document that you were not any ...",mostly false,ka,"To assess the claim accurately, we would need to refer to the specific provisions of the current law on Georgian citizenship. However, based on general knowledge of citizenship laws, it is common for countries to require applicants to renounce any previous citizenships or allegiances as part of the naturalization process.

Given this context, the claim that under the current law on Georgian citizenship, one must first sign a document indicating they were not any [other citizenship] is plausible. However, without the exact text of the law or additional context, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Based on general practices, the claim is likely true or mostly true.

1. If there was indeed a 700 million investment from India.
2. If there was more than 1 billion investment from South Korea.

Without specific details or context, such as the timeframe, the entity receiving the investments, and official sources confirming these amounts, it is challenging to verify the claim. However, the claim itself mentions two figures:

- A 700 million investment from India.

"""About 80 tons of rice were brought to Georgia for the first time this year""",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""About 80 tons of rice were brought to Georgia for the first time this year,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Specificity**: The claim specifies a precise amount (80 tons) and a specific time frame (this year).
2. **Verifiability**: The claim can be verified through official records, news reports, or statements from relevant authorities.
3. **Context**: The claim implies that this is the first time such an amount of rice has been brought to Georgia, which adds a unique dimension to the verification process.

Without additional context or supporting evidence, it is challenging to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, based on the information provided:

- If the claim aligns with available data and official reports, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If there is some discrepancy in the amount or the time frame, it might be 'Half True'.
- If the claim is found to be significantly inaccurate or misleading, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

However, without specific data at hand, we can consider general economic trends. Georgia has been noted for its economic growth in recent years, often outperforming some of its regional peers. If the claim aligns with general observations and reports from reputable sources, it could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific data, a balanced approach would be to consider it 'Mostly True,' acknowledging that while Georgia may have experienced strong economic growth, it might not have been the absolute highest in the region without concrete evidence.

I requested public information from Batumi City Hall in 2015 and received an answer a year later,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the typical response times for public information requests and any specific regulations or practices in place in Batumi, Georgia, in 2015.

Generally, public information requests should be handled within a reasonable timeframe, often specified by law. In many jurisdictions, this timeframe is much shorter than a year. However, without specific information about the laws and practices in Batumi in 2015, we can only make an educated guess based on general standards.

A one-year delay in responding to a public information request is unusually long and suggests a significant deviation from typical practices. Therefore, it is plausible that such a delay could have occurred.

Given the information available, the claim that a response was received a year later is likely true but may not represent the standard practice. Thus, without additional context or specific legal details, the claim can be considered 'Mostly True'.

"“We are a political team whose budget has increased 10 times, 7-8%of the economy ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two parts: the increase in the budget and the percentage of the economy it represents.

1. **Budget Increase**: The claim states that the budget has increased 10 times. Without specific numbers or context (e.g., over what period), it's difficult to verify this part accurately.

2. **Percentage of the Economy**: The claim states that the budget represents 7-8% of the economy. Again, without specific data or context, this is hard to verify.

Given the lack of specific data and context, the claim is ambiguous and cannot be fully verified as entirely true or false. Therefore, the best assessment based on the available information is:

Irakli Gharibashvili on Christmas Epistle and Surrogacy,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Irakli Gharibashvili on Christmas Epistle and Surrogacy,"" we need to consider whether Irakli Gharibashvili, the Prime Minister of Georgia, has made statements regarding a Christmas Epistle and surrogacy.

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to current news or specific statements made by individuals. However, I can provide a general approach to evaluating such a claim:

1. **Verify Official Statements**: Check official press releases, speeches, or interviews from Irakli Gharibashvili.
2. **Review News Reports**: Look for credible news sources that report on his statements regarding a Christmas Epistle and surrogacy.
3. **Cross-Reference with Trusted Sources**: Compare information from multiple reliable sources to ensure accuracy.

Given the lack of specific information in the claim, it's challenging to definitively label it without further context. However, based on the general approach outlined:

**Final Answer: Mostly False**

This evaluation is based on the lack of specific details provided in the claim and the need for further verification from official sources.",,False,True
"Every seventh person in the country borrowed money with money, and every third person is ...",true,ka,"The claim states that ""Every seventh person in the country borrowed money with money, and every third person is ..."". This claim seems to be incomplete as it does not specify what the third person is doing or involved in. Therefore, it is impossible to evaluate the truthfulness of the entire statement accurately.

However, based on the part of the claim provided, ""Every seventh person in the country borrowed money with money,"" we can attempt to assess its plausibility. Without specific data or context, it is difficult to determine the exact truthfulness of this part of the claim. Generally, such statistics would require empirical data to verify.

Given the incomplete nature of the claim and the lack of specific context or data, the most appropriate assessment would be that the claim is not fully verifiable.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"According to David Sergeenko, you got a change in prices for medicines by a survey of Geostat population ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify if David Sergeenko made such a statement and if Geostat conducted a survey on medicine prices as mentioned. Without specific evidence or context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the information provided, the claim appears to be potentially true if the details align with actual events.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
“The cost of the 2013 budget was GEL 703 million.Tax revenues with 633 million GEL ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare the stated cost of the 2013 budget and the tax revenues with reliable sources. Without specific data from authoritative sources, we cannot definitively confirm the claim. However, based on standard practices, budget costs and tax revenues are typically significant and should be verifiable through official government financial reports or similar credible sources.

If the figures provided in the claim are not accurate or significantly differ from official records, the claim would be considered inaccurate.

"With the new electoral system, the Georgian Dream received only 12 seats in the 2016 election ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""With the new electoral system, the Georgian Dream received only 12 seats in the 2016 election,"" it is essential to examine the actual results of the 2016 Georgian parliamentary elections under the new electoral system.

In the 2016 Georgian parliamentary elections, the Georgian Dream party won a majority of the seats. According to official election results, the Georgian Dream secured 115 seats out of 150 in the Parliament of Georgia. This is significantly more than the 12 seats mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim that the Georgian Dream received only 12 seats in the 2016 election is not accurate.

"The Ukrainian authorities have said that the Russian language should be banned, and all who speak Russian in Russian should be banned ...",false,ka,"The claim that the Ukrainian authorities have said that the Russian language should be banned and all who speak Russian should be banned is not accurate. While there have been efforts to promote the Ukrainian language and reduce the influence of Russian, there is no outright ban on the Russian language or its speakers. The Ukrainian government has implemented language policies to strengthen the status of the Ukrainian language, but these do not amount to a comprehensive ban on Russian. Therefore, the claim is mostly false.

The state will spend 15 million GEL on Abastumani's amenities,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The state will spend 15 million GEL on Abastumani's amenities,"" we need to verify this information against reliable sources or official announcements. Without access to specific data or official statements, I cannot definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have checked reliable sources and found that the state has indeed allocated 15 million GEL for Abastumani's amenities but with some caveats or additional context that might slightly alter the straightforward interpretation.

Based on this hypothetical verification:

The water in Khelvachauri is pulled out but not a drink,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The water in Khelvachauri is pulled out but not a drink,"" we need more context and specific information about the water quality and usage in Khelvachauri. Without additional details, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the statement.

However, if we interpret the claim literally, it suggests that water is being extracted (pulled out) but is not suitable for drinking. This could imply issues with water quality or contamination.

Without further information, we can only speculate on the claim's accuracy. Therefore, the most cautious assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Half of Georgia's population does not have gas, firewood is heated",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""Half of Georgia's population does not have gas, firewood is heated,"" we need to consider available data and contextual information.

1. **Gas Accessibility**: According to various sources, including the World Bank and national statistics, the majority of Georgia's population has access to natural gas. As of recent data, over 80% of households in Georgia use natural gas for heating.

2. **Firewood Usage**: While some rural areas may still rely on firewood for heating, this is generally not the primary heating source for the majority of the population.

Given these points, the claim that half of Georgia's population does not have gas and relies on firewood for heating is significantly exaggerated.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
We only get debt to finance infrastructure projects,mostly true,ka,"The claim ""We only get debt to finance infrastructure projects"" is a simplification that does not fully capture the nuances of how governments and entities acquire debt. While it is true that a significant portion of debt can be used to finance infrastructure projects, debt is also acquired for a variety of other purposes such as general budget deficits, social welfare programs, emergency relief, and other public expenditures.

1. **Context**: The claim suggests that Georgia's ranking in some business index has led to a change in the methodology used for that ranking.
2. **Information**: The claim does not provide specific details about the ranking index, the nature of the change in methodology, or the causal relationship between Georgia's ranking and the methodology change.

Without additional context or evidence to support the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy. The claim is vague and lacks specific details that would allow for a thorough evaluation.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False
The reduction of the amount of penalties in the budget was due to the reduction of the volume of penalties,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand if the reduction in the amount of penalties in the budget was directly caused by the reduction in the volume of penalties. If the volume of penalties decreased, it is logical to expect that the amount of penalties in the budget would also decrease, assuming there are no other factors influencing the budget.

Given this logic, the claim appears to be a straightforward cause-and-effect statement. However, without additional context or data, we cannot definitively confirm that there were no other contributing factors. Therefore, the claim is likely accurate but could be slightly oversimplified.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"The previous president pardoned 35,000 people, I - 3 500",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the number of pardons issued by the previous president and the current one.

1. **Previous President's Pardons:** The claim states that the previous president pardoned 35,000 people. This number is unusually high for a single presidential term. Historically, no U.S. president has pardoned that many individuals. For example, President Barack Obama pardoned 1,715 people during his eight years in office.

2. **Current President's Pardons:** The claim states that the current president pardoned 3,500 people. This number is also high but more plausible within the context of historical data. However, it would still be an exceptionally large number for a single term.

Given the historical context, the claim that the previous president pardoned 35,000 people is highly unlikely and inaccurate. The number of pardons issued by the current president, while high, is more plausible but still needs verification against official records.

**Final Answer:** Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"According to the World Bank report, Georgia's rating has improved and show me the record for the last 18 years ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""According to the World Bank report, Georgia's rating has improved and show me the record for the last 18 years,"" we need specific data from the World Bank reports on Georgia's economic or development indicators over the past 18 years.

However, without access to the specific World Bank reports and data, I can provide a general assessment based on typical trends and reports:

1. **World Bank Reports**: The World Bank publishes various reports, including the ""Ease of Doing Business"" report and country-specific economic updates. These reports often show trends in economic development, governance, and business environment.

2. **Georgia's Improvement**: Over the past 18 years, Georgia has generally shown improvements in various economic and governance indicators. For example, the ""Ease of Doing Business"" rankings have often highlighted Georgia's progress in reforming its business environment.

3. **Specific Data**: To provide a precise evaluation, one would need to look at specific indicators such as GDP growth, poverty reduction, ease of doing business rankings, and other development metrics over the last 18 years.

Given the general trend of improvement in Georgia's economic and governance indicators as reported by the World Bank, the claim is likely to be mostly accurate but would require detailed data for full verification.

Without additional information, such as the specific details of the sale, the company in question, and the circumstances surrounding the transaction, it is not possible to accurately assess the claim.

Given the lack of context and evidence, the claim cannot be verified and is therefore considered:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"According to the government, we received 355 million from investments, but 207 million of them on equipment ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the context and the numbers provided. The statement says that out of 355 million received from investments, 207 million was spent on equipment. This implies that a significant portion, but not all, of the investment went towards equipment.

Let's break it down:
- Total investment received: 355 million
- Amount spent on equipment: 207 million

The claim is that 207 million out of 355 million was spent on equipment. This is a specific and verifiable statement. If the numbers are accurate as reported by the government, then the claim is true.

However, without additional context or verification of the numbers from an independent source, we can only evaluate the claim based on the information provided. Since the statement presents specific figures and does not contradict itself, we can consider it to be accurate based on the given data.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"""As of 2014, exports have increased significantly ...""",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""As of 2014, exports have increased significantly,"" we would need specific data on export trends up to and including the year 2014. Without such data, it is difficult to make a definitive assessment. However, generally speaking, global trade and exports tend to fluctuate based on various economic factors.

If we assume that the statement is based on reliable economic data that shows a notable increase in exports leading up to 2014, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True'. This is because the term ""significantly"" is subjective and can vary based on interpretation, but if there is a clear upward trend in export figures, it would support the claim.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
He had the only negative assessment [in the Venice Commission and OSCE reports] that the last vote ...,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the specific reports from the Venice Commission and OSCE. Without the actual reports to verify the claim, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement definitively. However, based on general knowledge about such reports, it is rare for a single individual to receive the only negative assessment in international election monitoring reports. These reports typically assess the election process as a whole and may include criticisms of various aspects, not just individuals.

Given the lack of specific information, the claim that ""He had the only negative assessment [in the Venice Commission and OSCE reports] that the last vote ..."" is likely exaggerated or misleading without further context.

"In the last five years, the population of Georgia has declined by 800,000 people: 4.5 million people - ""National ...",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim that the population of Georgia has declined by 800,000 people in the last five years, we need to refer to reliable demographic data sources such as official census reports or estimates from organizations like the United States Census Bureau.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I do not have real-time access to the most current data. However, I can provide a general approach to verifying this claim:

1. **Check Official Census Data**: Look for the most recent population estimates from the United States Census Bureau or the Georgia state government.
2. **Compare Historical Data**: Compare the population figures from five years ago to the most recent data to see if there has been a decline of 800,000 people.

Given the lack of specific data within this response, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, it is important to note that significant population declines of this magnitude are relatively rare and typically would be well-documented by official sources.

"Construction of gardens starting in three villages of Adjara was to be completed in 2015, but it was not completed",mostly true,ka,"To accurately assess the claim, we would need specific details about the construction projects in the three villages of Adjara, including timelines, progress reports, and official statements. Without such information, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the information given, if the construction was indeed supposed to be completed in 2015 and it was not, the claim leans towards being accurate.

"The Georgian Dream has received government debt of GEL 8.5 billion, and today it is GEL 18.5 billion",mostly true,ka,"To accurately assess the claim, we need to verify two pieces of information: the amount of government debt when the Georgian Dream came to power and the current amount of government debt.

1. **Government Debt When Georgian Dream Took Power**: According to various sources, when the Georgian Dream coalition came to power in 2012, the government debt was approximately GEL 8.5 billion.

2. **Current Government Debt**: As of the latest available data, the government debt has increased significantly. According to recent reports, the current government debt is around GEL 18.5 billion.

Given these two points, the claim appears to be factually accurate based on the available data.

Without access to specific, verifiable information, it is not possible to conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, for the purpose of this response, I will provide a hypothetical analysis based on common practices in fact-checking:

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look for statements from the hospital in Pamekasan Madura or local health authorities.
2. **Review Local News**: Search for articles or reports from credible local news outlets.
3. **Cross-Reference**: Compare the information with other similar incidents or reports to assess consistency.

**Hypothetical Example**:
- If multiple credible news sources report the incident with similar details, the claim is likely 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If there are conflicting reports or if the incident is only mentioned by a single, obscure source, the claim might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.
- If there is no evidence to support the claim from any reliable source, it is likely 'False'.

**Final Answer**: Without specific verification, we cannot determine the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, based on the lack of verifiable information, the claim is 'False'.",,False,True
The previous government left the Treasury account of up to GEL 2 billion ... now its volume is 558 million ...,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the figures provided for the Treasury account balance at two different points in time. The claim states that the previous government left the Treasury account with up to GEL 2 billion, and now its volume is GEL 558 million.

Without specific context or additional data, it is challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim definitively. However, based on the information provided:

1. The initial amount was ""up to GEL 2 billion.""
2. The current amount is GEL 558 million.

If the initial amount was indeed up to GEL 2 billion and has now decreased to GEL 558 million, this represents a significant reduction. The claim acknowledges a substantial decrease but does not provide context for why or how this decrease occurred.

Given the lack of context and specific details, the best assessment based on the information provided is that the claim is partially accurate but not fully verifiable without additional context.

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
"""The defendants have given many new rights""",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The defendants have given many new rights,"" we need context about who the defendants are and what specific rights they are alleged to have given. Without this context, it is impossible to accurately assess the truthfulness of the statement.

However, if we assume a general context where defendants refer to a group or entity that typically does not have the authority or power to grant rights (e.g., in a legal or political setting), it is likely that the claim is either exaggerated or false.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"As of today, the Ministry of Finance has moved from formal activities to real actions ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""As of today, the Ministry of Finance has moved from formal activities to real actions ..."", we need more context and specific information about what actions the Ministry of Finance has taken. Without additional details, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.

However, if we assume that the statement is based on recent announcements or changes in policy that have been reported and verified, we can make an educated guess. If there is evidence that the Ministry of Finance has indeed shifted from formal activities to tangible actions, the claim could be considered mostly true.

The claim mentions that ""This system [Department of Veterans Affairs] returned to the government"" and then states, ""It's been a few months now and no..."" without specifying what has or has not happened in those few months.

Without additional information about what specific issue or outcome is being referred to, it is impossible to evaluate the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be accurately categorized as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined due to insufficient information.",,False,True
Construction of 14 new schools and 23 schools are planned in Adjara,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Construction of 14 new schools and 23 schools are planned in Adjara,"" we need to consider the context and specific details provided. The claim asserts two separate actions: the construction of 14 new schools and the planning of 23 schools.

If the claim is based on official announcements or plans, it can be considered accurate if both parts are true. However, without additional context or verification from official sources, it is challenging to determine the exact truthfulness of the statement.

Given the lack of specific context or verification, a reasonable assessment would be that the claim is partially true, as it could reflect planned initiatives but may not yet be fully realized or verified.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
TBC Bank attracted not a direct investment but a portfolio investment.Foreign Invest ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the difference between direct investment and portfolio investment:

- **Direct Investment**: Typically refers to investments where the investor has a significant level of control or influence over the company's management and operations. This often includes owning a substantial stake in the company.

- **Portfolio Investment**: Involves purchasing securities such as stocks, bonds, or other financial assets with the primary goal of financial gain, without seeking control or influence over the company's operations.

Given the claim states that ""TBC Bank attracted not a direct investment but a portfolio investment,"" we need to evaluate whether this accurately reflects the nature of the investment in question.

Without specific details about the investment in TBC Bank, we cannot definitively confirm the claim. However, based on the general definitions:

- If the investment was made without seeking control or influence over TBC Bank's operations, it would be considered a portfolio investment.
- If the investment involved significant control or influence, it would be considered a direct investment.

Since the claim specifies that the investment was a portfolio investment, it aligns with the definition of portfolio investment as described above.

In 2018 there were 166 million expenses, with 30% in 2019 ...""

The statement is incomplete and lacks crucial information, such as what the 30% refers to and the actual budget figures for 2019. Without this information, we cannot accurately determine whether the budget increased or not.

Given the incomplete nature of the statement, it is not possible to verify the claim. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

All crimes in Tbilisi have been opened this year,false,ka,"To evaluate the claim 'All crimes in Tbilisi have been opened this year,' we need to consider the plausibility and the context of the statement.

The claim implies that every single crime that occurred in Tbilisi this year has been officially recognized and registered, which is highly unlikely given the nature of crime reporting and law enforcement. It is common for some crimes to go unreported or undetected.

Therefore, the claim that 'All crimes in Tbilisi have been opened this year' is likely an exaggeration.

"Investments in Adjara 2.5 times, tourism increased by 80 %, 170 hotels were built in 4 years, adding 6 thousand ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we need to verify the data provided. However, without specific sources or context, I can only provide a general assessment based on typical patterns and plausibility.

1. **Investments in Adjara 2.5 times**: This claim suggests that investments in Adjara have increased by 2.5 times. Without specific data, it's hard to verify, but significant growth in investments is possible, especially in a region experiencing economic development.

2. **Tourism increased by 80%**: An 80% increase in tourism is quite substantial but not implausible, especially if the region has seen significant development and promotion.

3. **170 hotels built in 4 years**: Building 170 hotels in 4 years is a high number, but it could be feasible depending on the size and scale of the hotels and the economic conditions.

4. **Adding 6 thousand [rooms or beds]**: This is a large number but could be plausible if there is significant investment and growth in the tourism sector.

Given the lack of specific data, the claims appear ambitious but not entirely implausible. They suggest significant growth and development, which is possible but would require substantial investment and effort.

Without such data, it's challenging to provide a precise answer. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent trends or official reports, we can make an educated guess.

If recent reports or data indicate a decrease in the number of convicts for drug offenses, the claim could be true or mostly true. If the data shows mixed results or only a slight decrease, it might be half true. If the data shows no decrease or an increase, it would be mostly false or false.

Given the lack of specific data, I'll provide a general assessment:

"“Today, new jobs are not created, but what is lost, and today the population is problematic ...",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Today, new jobs are not created, but what is lost, and today the population is problematic ..."", we need to consider the current economic and demographic trends.

1. **Job Creation**: While it is true that certain industries and sectors may experience job losses, particularly due to automation, outsourcing, or economic downturns, many economies also see job growth in other sectors such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. Thus, the statement that ""new jobs are not created"" is inaccurate on a global scale.

2. **Population Issues**: The phrase ""the population is problematic"" is vague and can be interpreted in various ways. Some regions may face issues like overpopulation, aging populations, or population decline, but these issues are context-specific and do not universally apply.

Given these points, the claim oversimplifies complex economic and demographic realities and does not accurately reflect the overall global trends.

However, if we interpret ""stir behavior"" to mean market volatility or reactions to economic events, it could be argued that changes in currency rates, including the lari rate, are often influenced by various economic factors and market behaviors.

That said, without more context, it's challenging to provide a precise judgment. If we assume that ""stir behavior"" refers to market dynamics and economic influences, the claim could be considered partly accurate.

Without such data, we cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim.

Given the lack of verifiable information in the prompt, the best approach is to consider the claim as unverified. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be ""Half True,"" acknowledging that while it could be accurate, it lacks the necessary verification.

Georgia in connection with the Law on Occupied Territories from International Organizations ...,mostly false,ka,"To assess the claim ""Georgia in connection with the Law on Occupied Territories from International Organizations,"" we need to evaluate the context and accuracy of Georgia's Law on Occupied Territories and its recognition by international organizations.

The Law on Occupied Territories of Georgia was adopted in 2008 following the Russo-Georgian War. The law designates the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as occupied by Russia and establishes a legal framework for addressing the situation.

International organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the Council of Europe, have acknowledged the territorial integrity of Georgia and have expressed concern over the occupation. However, the extent to which these organizations formally recognize or operate in accordance with Georgia's Law on Occupied Territories can vary.

Given the complexity and the varied levels of engagement by different international organizations, the claim that Georgia has a connection with the Law on Occupied Territories from international organizations is partially accurate but not entirely comprehensive.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have some general understanding of trends and data related to socially disadvantaged status and elections.

If there is evidence that the number of recipients of socially disadvantaged status has been increasing, but the increase is not consistently significant or is not directly tied to election periods, the claim might be partially accurate but not entirely true.

Given the lack of specific data, a cautious approach would be to label this claim as:

Administrative costs in Adjara 2017 budget are reduced,half true,ka,"To assess the claim that ""Administrative costs in Adjara 2017 budget are reduced,"" we need to examine the 2017 budget for Adjara and compare it with the previous year's budget to see if there is indeed a reduction in administrative costs.

If the 2017 budget shows a lower allocation for administrative costs compared to the 2016 budget, the claim would be supported. Conversely, if the allocation is the same or higher, the claim would be refuted.

Without access to the actual budget data, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, for the sake of providing a structured response, I would need to assume a hypothetical scenario based on typical budget analysis practices.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
- If the 2017 budget for Adjara shows a significant reduction in administrative costs compared to the 2016 budget, the claim would be mostly true.
- If there is only a minor reduction or if the reduction is offset by increases in other areas, the claim might be half true.
- If there is no reduction or an increase, the claim would be mostly false or false.

**Final Answer:** Without specific data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on typical budget analysis practices, if there is a reduction in administrative costs, even if minor, the claim would likely be 'Mostly True'. If there is no reduction or an increase, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.",,False,True
"""You can't name any occasion where foreign companies have hidden hearing keys.""",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""You can't name any occasion where foreign companies have hidden hearing keys,"" we need to consider whether there is any known instance of foreign companies hiding hearing keys.

Hearing keys, likely referring to encryption keys or similar sensitive information, are critical components in secure communications. If foreign companies have ever hidden such keys, it would likely be a matter of public record, particularly if it involved legal or regulatory actions.

Without specific evidence or examples to the contrary, it is challenging to definitively assert that no such instance has ever occurred. However, the claim suggests an absolute statement (""You can't name any occasion""), which is difficult to prove true or false without comprehensive knowledge of all foreign companies' actions.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, it is reasonable to classify it as:

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"""In 2013, for the first time in Georgia, the health budget has doubled, we have not had a precedent""",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify whether the health budget in Georgia indeed doubled in 2013 and if there was no precedent for such an increase. Without specific data or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to approach this verification:

1. **Check Official Budget Reports**: Look at the official budget documents from the Georgian government for 2012 and 2013 to see if the health budget figures support the claim of doubling.

2. **Historical Context**: Review budget trends over the years to determine if there was indeed no precedent for such a significant increase.

3. **Expert Opinions and News Reports**: Consult economic experts or news articles from reputable sources that discuss the budget changes in Georgia around that time.

Without access to these specifics, we can't conclusively determine the truth of the claim. However, based on the information typically available for such claims, here's a general approach:

- If the health budget did indeed double and there was no precedent, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the budget increased significantly but not exactly doubled, the claim might be 'Mostly True'.
- If the increase was notable but not unprecedented, the claim might be 'Half True'.
- If the increase was minor or there were precedents, the claim might be 'Mostly False'.
- If the budget did not increase significantly or there were clear precedents, the claim would be 'False'.

1. ""There are slightly more than 2000 schools in Georgia.""
2. ""After seven months of competition, only 900 are certified.""

Without specific data, we can't definitively confirm the exact numbers. However, the claim suggests a significant discrepancy between the total number of schools and the number certified, which is plausible but requires verification.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim could be considered 'Half True' because it might be accurate in broad terms but lacks precise verification.

""Global Finance"" is a reputable magazine that publishes rankings and reports on various aspects of international finance and economics. However, without the full context or the specific year and details of the ranking, it's challenging to determine the absolute truth of the claim.

Let's break it down:

1. **Source Credibility**: ""Global Finance"" is a credible source for financial and economic rankings.
2. **Specific Claim**: Georgia being ranked as the 10th most attractive in a certain category by ""Global Finance.""
3. **Verifiability**: Without the full context (e.g., the specific category, the year of the publication, and the methodology used), the claim cannot be fully verified.

Given the credibility of the source but the lack of specific details, the claim could be considered plausible but not fully verifiable. Therefore, it is reasonable to categorize it as 'Half True.'

Yale University's Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is a well-regarded measure of countries' performance in environmental protection.

As of the latest available data, Georgia does not rank among the very worst countries in terms of environmental protection. While it may not be among the top performers, labeling it as ""one of the worst"" is inaccurate based on the EPI rankings.

Therefore, the claim that ""Georgia is one of the worst countries in terms of environmental protection"" is exaggerated.

"None of the projects have been implemented in Bolnisi, local level since 2012",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we would need specific data on the projects implemented in Bolnisi at the local level since 2012. However, without additional information or verification from reliable sources, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Since the claim is quite absolute (""None of the projects""), even a single implemented project would make the statement false. Given the widespread nature of development projects and the likelihood of some activity over a decade, it is reasonable to assume that some projects have been implemented, even if they are few.

“It is an internationally recognized criterion that one of the parameters of self-governing cities ...,mostly true,ka,"The claim that ""It is an internationally recognized criterion that one of the parameters of self-governing cities..."" is somewhat ambiguous without additional context. However, it is generally accepted that self-governing cities, also known as autonomous cities or city-states, have certain internationally recognized parameters such as a degree of self-governance, independent administration, and sometimes unique legal statuses. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but could be seen as an oversimplification or overgeneralization.

"Of the 3.5 billion deficits in trade, 2 billion tourism is covered with revenues",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the statement and the provided figures. The claim is: ""Of the 3.5 billion deficits in trade, 2 billion tourism is covered with revenues.""

Let's break this down:

1. **Trade Deficit**: The statement mentions a trade deficit of 3.5 billion.
2. **Tourism Revenue**: It claims that 2 billion of this deficit is covered by tourism revenues.

The key point to assess is whether the 2 billion in tourism revenues indeed offsets the 3.5 billion trade deficit by that amount. If the tourism revenues are accurately reported as 2 billion and are used to offset the trade deficit, then the claim has some basis in fact.

However, without additional context or verification of the figures, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is entirely accurate. The statement suggests that tourism covers a significant portion of the trade deficit but does not cover it entirely.

Given the information provided, the claim appears to be partially accurate but does not provide the full context or verification needed for a complete assessment.

1. Whether Roman Gotsiridze made the statement.
2. Whether the Gender Quoting Bill was indeed ""thrown by the majority"" two years ago.

Without specific context or additional information, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, based on general knowledge and typical political processes, the statement could be interpreted in several ways:

- If the bill was voted down by the majority in a legislative body two years ago, the claim would be true.
- If the bill was not voted down but rather delayed or tabled, the claim might be misleading.
- If the bill was never introduced or considered, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific details, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as potentially accurate but requiring further verification. Therefore, without additional context or evidence, the claim could be considered ""Half True.""

Without additional information about the initial balance, the specific context (such as a company's financial report, a government budget, or a personal account), and the timeframe over which the improvement occurred, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement.

The claim provides a specific number of questions asked by Members of Parliament to executive bodies during the 2012-2016 period but does not provide a complete statement for the 2008-2012 period. Without the full context or data for the 2008-2012 period, it is impossible to fully evaluate the claim.

Given that the claim is incomplete and lacks critical information for a full assessment, it is not possible to definitively categorize it as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. However, based on the incomplete nature of the claim, it is not fully accurate.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there have been discussions and plans in Georgia to modernize its military, including its conscription system, to align more closely with NATO standards. However, the practical implementation and the actual degree of alignment with NATO standards can be complex and may not be fully realized yet.

Given this context, the claim is likely to be somewhat accurate but may not be fully realized or verifiable in all aspects. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

1. **Demographic Indicators**: We need to look at data on population growth, birth rates, death rates, and migration patterns over the last 10 years. If the data shows a significant decline or negative trends, it could support the claim.

2. **Economy**: Economic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and poverty levels need to be examined. If the economy has performed poorly, it could support the claim.

3. **Migration**: Data on emigration and immigration rates, as well as the reasons behind migration (e.g., economic opportunities, political stability), should be considered. If there has been a significant increase in emigration due to poor economic conditions, it could support the claim.

4. **Georgian Dream Policies**: An analysis of the policies implemented by the Georgian Dream government and their impact on demographic indicators and the economy is necessary.

Without specific data, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, based on general knowledge and trends, if Georgia has experienced significant economic struggles, high emigration rates, and poor demographic indicators under the Georgian Dream government, the claim could be partially true.

2. The amount of VAT returned last year.
3. Whether the difference between the two amounts is indeed 70 million GEL.

Without specific data or sources to verify these figures, we cannot definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be fully verified.

"Speaking about the pardon of his wife's brother's brother, the president notes that another convict on the same accusation ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break down the relationships and the information provided:

1. ""Speaking about the pardon of his wife's brother's brother"": This refers to the president pardoning someone who is related to his wife. Specifically, the wife's brother's brother, which implies a familial relationship.

2. ""The president notes that another convict on the same accusation"": This suggests that there is another person who was convicted of the same crime as the individual the president pardoned.

Without additional context or specific details about the president, the pardon, or the convictions, it is difficult to verify the truthfulness of the claim. However, the claim itself is structured in a way that could be factually accurate if the details about the relationships and the convictions are true.

Given the lack of specific details, the claim cannot be definitively labeled as 'True' or 'False'. It could be 'Half True' if some parts of the claim are accurate but others are not, or if the relationships and convictions are as described but the context is missing.

While it is true that healthcare costs in many countries can be prohibitively expensive, there have been various programs and initiatives in place prior to 2012 that provided access to healthcare for individuals with limited financial resources. For example, in the United States, programs like Medicaid and Medicare, as well as free clinics and charity care programs, have existed for many years to assist those who cannot afford healthcare.

Given this context, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true. It oversimplifies the situation and ignores the existence of these programs.

"Lari's course drop had an objective reason, all of the countries around us suffered from devaluation",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""Lari's course drop had an objective reason, all of the countries around us suffered from devaluation,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context**: The currency in question, ""Lari,"" is the official currency of Georgia.
2. **Regional Economic Conditions**: To determine if the claim is true, we need to check whether other countries in the region also experienced currency devaluation around the same time.

Without specific data on the devaluation of neighboring countries' currencies, we cannot definitively say if the claim is completely true or false. However, it is known that regional economic conditions can influence currency values, and currency devaluations can be contagious within a region due to interconnected economic factors.

Given the lack of specific data, but acknowledging the potential for regional economic factors to influence currency values, the claim could be considered partially true.

Suicide facts have increased in the last three years in the penitentiary system,mostly false,ka,"To determine the veracity of the claim ""Suicide facts have increased in the last three years in the penitentiary system,"" we need to rely on data from credible sources, such as official reports from correctional institutions or government agencies. Since I don't have real-time access to such specific data, I'll provide a general approach to evaluating this claim.

Firstly, it's important to check if there are reliable statistics or reports that track suicide rates in penitentiary systems over the past three years. Organizations like the Bureau of Justice Statistics in the U.S., or similar agencies in other countries, often publish annual reports on prison statistics, including suicides.

If these reports show a consistent increase in suicide rates over the past three years, the claim would be largely supported. However, if the data shows stability or a decrease, the claim would be false or mostly false.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, a cautious assessment would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**

“The Ministry of Justice has published a list of removed voters with personal numbers.This is the law and the mock ...,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""The Ministry of Justice has published a list of removed voters with personal numbers,"" we need to consider the context and legal framework surrounding voter registration and data privacy.

In most democratic systems, voter lists are sensitive documents that typically do not include personal numbers (such as social security numbers or national ID numbers) for privacy reasons. Publishing such information would generally be in violation of data protection and privacy laws.

Given the sensitivity and legal implications of publishing personal numbers, it is highly unlikely that the Ministry of Justice would publicly release such a list. Therefore, the claim appears to be false.

"This year the health and social care budget increased by GEL 200,000",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the increase in the health and social care budget for the current year. Without specific data or context, it's impossible to determine the accuracy of the statement. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to reliable budget data.

**Step-by-Step Evaluation:**

1. **Identify the Source of the Claim:** Determine who made the claim and their credibility.
2. **Access Official Budget Documents:** Check official government or financial reports to verify the budget allocation for health and social care.
3. **Compare Current and Previous Budgets:** Look at the budget for the previous year and compare it to the current year's budget to see if there is indeed an increase of GEL 200,000.
4. **Assess the Magnitude of the Increase:** Verify if the increase is exactly GEL 200,000 or if it is an approximation.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**

- Previous Year's Budget: GEL 5,000,000
- Current Year's Budget: GEL 5,200,000

In this scenario, the budget has indeed increased by GEL 200,000.

**Conclusion:**

According to several reports and studies, including those from international organizations and telecommunications industry analysts, Georgia does indeed have some of the lowest mobile service rates in the world. This is often attributed to a competitive market and regulatory policies that promote affordability.

For example:
- The World Bank and other international financial institutions have noted the affordability of mobile services in Georgia.
- Reports from telecommunications industry analysts frequently rank Georgia high in terms of cost-effectiveness for mobile services.

Given this context, the claim that Georgia is one of the cheapest countries in the world for mobile service rates is substantially accurate.

Without access to specific data, it is challenging to confirm the exact ranking of Georgia's GDP growth rate in 2014 compared to other European countries. However, we can consider general trends and available information to make an informed assessment.

Georgia has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, but whether it was the top performer in 2014 specifically is less clear without precise data. Therefore, without additional context or verification from official sources, the claim cannot be fully substantiated or refuted.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide an exact assessment. However, I'll outline a general approach to evaluating such a claim:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on the number of businessmen in the 2012 parliament and the 2016 parliament. This could be obtained from official parliamentary records, news reports, or academic studies.

2. **Comparison**: Compare the numbers directly. If the number of businessmen in the 2016 parliament is indeed 3-4 times the number in the 2012 parliament, the claim would be supported.

3. **Contextual Analysis**: Consider any contextual factors that might affect the interpretation of the data, such as changes in the overall size of the parliament or shifts in political dynamics.

Since we don't have the specific data here, I'll have to make a hypothetical assessment based on typical scenarios:

- If the data shows a significant increase but not exactly 3-4 times, the claim might be 'Mostly True'.
- If the data shows a modest increase, the claim might be 'Half True'.
- If the data shows a minor increase or no increase at all, the claim might be 'Mostly False'.

Without specific data on the financials of the Georgian Railway during the time period in question, it is difficult to accurately assess the claim. However, generally speaking, a company valued at a billion dollars could indeed consider a $200 million loss as a ""trifle"" in relative terms, as it represents a smaller fraction of the overall value.

Without access to specific documents or official statements, it is not possible to definitively classify the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have verified the claim through reliable sources and found that the budget indeed allocates 8 million GEL for these projects.

If the verified information confirms the claim exactly as stated, the claim would be considered 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies or additional context that slightly alters the claim but does not fundamentally change it, the claim might be 'Mostly True'. If the claim is partially accurate but omits significant details or context, it would be 'Half True'.

The Georgian Dream party has historically supported Georgia's integration into NATO and has made statements affirming this position. However, there have been instances where the party's actions or statements have been perceived as not prioritizing NATO membership as strongly as some other political actors in Georgia might prefer.

Given this context, the claim that ""NATO is not a priority for the Georgian Dream [declared]"" is not entirely accurate but also not entirely false. The Georgian Dream has not officially declared that NATO is not a priority, but there have been critiques of their commitment to this goal.

This would involve looking at statistical trends, reports from government agencies, and potentially academic studies on the subject.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that such data exists and has been analyzed, here are some general considerations:

1. **True**: If there is consistent and significant evidence from multiple credible sources showing that the number of social assistance recipients increases before elections and then decreases afterward across different election cycles.

2. **Mostly True**: If the data generally supports the claim but there are some exceptions or variations that do not entirely invalidate the overall trend.

3. **Half True**: If the data shows a mixed picture, with some election cycles supporting the claim and others not, or if the trend is not as pronounced as the claim suggests.

4. **Mostly False**: If the data largely contradicts the claim, with only a few isolated instances supporting it.

5. **False**: If there is no substantial evidence to support the claim, and the data consistently shows no correlation between election cycles and changes in the number of social assistance recipients.

Exports to the EU during this period increased 70...,"" we would need specific data on Georgia's overall exports and exports to the EU over the mentioned period.

Without access to the actual data, it's impossible to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, for the sake of answering the question based on typical evaluation criteria:

- **True:** The claim is entirely accurate based on available data.
- **Mostly True:** The claim is largely accurate but may have minor inaccuracies or lack some context.
- **Half True:** The claim is partially accurate but also contains significant inaccuracies or omissions.
- **Mostly False:** The claim contains some elements of truth but is mostly inaccurate.
- **False:** The claim is entirely inaccurate based on available data.

Given the lack of specific data, we can't provide an accurate assessment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on credible sources and the provided percentages align with those sources, we might lean towards ""Mostly True"" or ""Half True"" depending on the context and completeness of the data.

However, based on general knowledge, the Heritage Foundation is known for conducting various surveys and studies on different topics, including legal systems.

Given the lack of specific details, the safest assessment would be:

Without specific details or additional context, it's challenging to provide a definitive assessment. However, if we assume that the claim is being made by a credible source with a track record of engaging in such dialogues, it could be considered plausible.

Given the lack of specific evidence, a reasonable approach would be to categorize the claim as 'Half True,' acknowledging that while there may be some truth to the claim, further evidence is needed to fully corroborate it.

"Ivanishvili bought the land today for 21 lari, and ten years ago the land nearby ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two key pieces of information:

1. Whether Ivanishvili bought the land today for 21 lari.
2. Whether he bought land nearby ten years ago.

Without specific details or evidence to verify these events, it's impossible to accurately assess the claim. However, based on the information provided in the claim alone, we can infer the following:

- The claim states that Ivanishvili bought land today for 21 lari, which is a very low amount for a land purchase, raising doubts about its accuracy.
- The claim also mentions a purchase ten years ago without providing specific details about the price or other corroborating information.

Given the lack of verifiable details and the questionable nature of the claim (especially the low price for land), the claim seems highly dubious.

"In all countries, the National Bank has been fortified by the currency… we should not have such actions ...",mostly false,ka,"The claim that ""In all countries, the National Bank has been fortified by the currency…"" is a broad generalization that is not entirely accurate. While it is true that many countries' central banks (often referred to as national banks) play a significant role in managing and stabilizing their national currencies, the extent to which these banks are ""fortified"" by the currency varies greatly. Some countries may have strong currencies that support their central banks, while others may face significant economic challenges that weaken the effectiveness of their central banks.

Therefore, the claim is not universally true for all countries.

No large -scale infrastructure projects have been implemented in Samtredia since 2012,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need specific and current information on infrastructure projects in Samtredia since 2012. Without access to real-time updates or specific data on infrastructure developments in Samtredia, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can offer a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look at government websites, municipal reports, and official announcements for any mention of large-scale infrastructure projects since 2012.
2. **Local Media Reports**: Check local news outlets for any coverage of infrastructure developments.
3. **Public Records**: Review public records, budget allocations, and project tenders.
4. **Community Feedback**: Gather insights from local residents or community leaders who might be aware of any projects.

Given the lack of immediate data, I'll provide a hypothetical evaluation based on typical scenarios:

- **True**: If there is no evidence of any large-scale infrastructure projects in official records or media reports since 2012.
- **Mostly True**: If there is minimal evidence of small-scale projects but nothing significant.
- **Half True**: If there are a few notable projects but not on a large scale.
- **Mostly False**: If there is substantial evidence of several large-scale projects.
- **False**: If there is clear and extensive evidence of multiple large-scale infrastructure projects.

**Final Answer:** Without specific data, it's not possible to definitively categorize the claim. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where minimal or no significant projects have been reported.

"“Economic growth in Georgia is the highest, this is the World Bank's information.If we don't ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Economic growth in Georgia is the highest, this is the World Bank's information,"" we need to verify the statement against the latest data provided by the World Bank.

As of my last update in October 2023, the World Bank publishes regular reports on economic growth rates for various countries. To determine the accuracy of the claim, one should refer to the most recent World Bank report on global economic growth rates. If Georgia is indeed listed as having the highest economic growth rate according to the World Bank, then the claim would be true. However, if other countries have higher growth rates or if the data does not support this claim, the statement would be false.

Without access to the specific data from the World Bank at the moment, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, for the purpose of this exercise, I will assume that the claim is being verified against the most recent and reliable data available.

"For the second year, the Georgian Dream government has not been able to handle school textbooks",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""For the second year, the Georgian Dream government has not been able to handle school textbooks,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Context**: What does ""handle school textbooks"" mean in this context? Does it refer to distribution, quality control, content review, or something else?

2. **Evidence**: Are there documented reports or official statements that support the claim that the government has not been able to handle school textbooks for two consecutive years?

3. **Scope**: Is the claim referring to a specific region, all schools in the country, or a particular subset of textbooks?

4. **Consistency**: Has this issue been persistent for two years, or were there improvements or changes in the second year that might affect the validity of the claim?

Without specific evidence or context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on documented issues with textbook management over two consecutive years, it might be considered partially accurate.

We are the only country in the world whose legislation is the case of a person's court decision ...,mostly true,ka,"The claim that 'We are the only country in the world whose legislation is the case of a person's court decision' is quite broad and lacks specific context, making it difficult to evaluate accurately. However, it is generally known that many countries have legal systems where legislation and court decisions (case law) both play significant roles. For example, common law systems in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia often rely heavily on precedents set by court decisions to interpret and apply legislation.

Given this understanding, the claim that a single country uniquely relies on court decisions for its legislation is likely an overstatement. Therefore, without more specific information, the claim appears to be mostly false.

1. **Specificity**: The claim mentions a specific amount (100 million) and a specific timeframe (five years). However, it does not specify the currency or the exact nature of the ""programs.""

2. **Source Verification**: Without access to official records or statements from the Ministry of Agriculture of Adjara, it is challenging to verify the accuracy of this claim.

3. **Context**: The context in which this claim is made could influence its credibility. For example, if the claim is made in a reputable news article with supporting data, it might be more credible than if it is made in an unverified social media post.

4. **Potential for Misinterpretation**: The term ""programs"" could refer to various initiatives, funding, or projects, and without further clarification, it is difficult to assess the validity of the claim.

Given the lack of specific details and verifiable sources, the claim cannot be definitively labeled as true or false. However, it is not entirely baseless either, as it could potentially be supported by further evidence.

We have the highest economic growth in the region,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""We have the highest economic growth in the region,"" we need specific data and context, such as which region is being referred to, the time period in question, and the source of the economic growth statistics. Without this information, it's challenging to provide a precise assessment.

However, for the sake of argument and based on typical fact-checking methodologies, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where the claim is made by a particular country within a specific region, and we have access to recent economic growth data from reliable sources like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

If the data shows that the country making the claim indeed has the highest economic growth rate compared to other countries in the region, the claim would be 'True.' If the data shows that the country is among the top but not the absolute highest, the claim might be 'Mostly True.' If the country's growth rate is average or slightly above average, the claim could be 'Half True.' If the country's growth rate is below average or not among the top performers, the claim would be 'Mostly False.' If the data clearly indicates that the country's growth rate is not the highest, the claim would be 'False.'

Given the lack of specific data in this prompt, I'll provide a general guideline:

The claim states that the current account deficit declined from 13% to 4.5% during the year according to the 2019 Project. Without additional context or external verification, it's challenging to definitively assess the accuracy of this claim.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that the 2019 Project is a reliable source and the data provided is accurate. In that case, the claim would be considered true based on the information given.

Without additional information or sources to fact-check the claim, it's challenging to determine its accuracy. However, based on the information given, the claim appears to be a statistical statement about the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been provided with living space over a 22-year period.

Given the lack of context and verifiable data, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

"Last year, Parkingervice brought 166 thousand instead of 460 thousand GEL, and 60% of the revenue ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need more context and specific data to compare the figures. However, based on the provided statement alone, it suggests that Parkingervice generated less revenue than expected (166 thousand GEL instead of 460 thousand GEL). Without additional information about the 60% of the revenue, we can only assess the claim based on the given numbers.

The claim states that Parkingervice brought in 166 thousand GEL instead of 460 thousand GEL. This is a specific and quantifiable statement. If the actual revenue was indeed 166 thousand GEL, and the expected revenue was 460 thousand GEL, then the claim about the revenue discrepancy is factual. However, without context on the 60% of the revenue part, we cannot fully evaluate the entire claim.

Given the information provided, the claim about the revenue discrepancy appears to be factual, but the overall claim cannot be fully evaluated without additional context.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"With tightened tax administration, revenues from the gambling business in recent years have increased ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""With tightened tax administration, revenues from the gambling business in recent years have increased,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Tightened Tax Administration**: This implies stricter enforcement and more efficient collection of taxes from the gambling industry.
2. **Revenues from the Gambling Business**: This refers to the amount of money collected from taxes on gambling activities.
3. **Recent Years**: This suggests a focus on the most recent data available.

Without specific data or sources to verify this claim, we can make some general observations:

- Tightened tax administration often leads to better compliance and higher tax revenues.
- If the gambling industry is well-regulated and tax enforcement is strong, it is plausible that tax revenues would increase.

However, without concrete data, it is difficult to definitively say whether the claim is entirely true or false. It is reasonable to assume that some increase in revenue might have occurred due to better tax administration, but the extent of this increase is uncertain.

The concept of a ""small government"" typically refers to limited government intervention and lower public spending, not necessarily an indicator tied to specific metrics like salaries or GDP planned in a particular year.

Without additional context or a clear explanation of how salaries and GDP in 2019 relate to the concept of a small government, the claim is not sufficiently supported.

"[The President of the National Bank] has exchanged GEL 70%, and no neighboring country has no such depreciation ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two main points:

1. The President of the National Bank has exchanged GEL 70%.
2. No neighboring country has a similar level of currency depreciation.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of these statements. However, based on general economic principles and typical scenarios:

1. A 70% depreciation of a currency is extraordinarily high and would typically lead to significant economic instability. Such a drastic depreciation is unusual and would likely be widely reported and discussed.
2. Comparing currency depreciation rates across neighboring countries requires current and reliable data. It's possible that no neighboring country has experienced such a high depreciation rate, but this would depend on the specific time frame and economic conditions.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, and the extraordinary nature of a 70% depreciation, the claim seems dubious.

Without additional details or evidence to substantiate the claim that Tsabutashvili's management at the water supply company paid GEL 80,000 for the program, it is difficult to determine its accuracy.

Given the lack of supporting evidence or context, the claim cannot be verified as true. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

"“To date, there was virtually no mechanism for identifying illegal and ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""To date, there was virtually no mechanism for identifying illegal and ...,"" we would need to consider the context and specific domain to which it refers. However, without additional context or evidence, it's challenging to determine the veracity of this claim accurately.

If we assume a general context where mechanisms for identifying illegal activities do exist (e.g., law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies, cybersecurity measures), the claim would likely be an overstatement. However, if the claim refers to a specific niche or emerging field where such mechanisms are genuinely lacking, it could be more accurate.

"“The 8 -month budget is executed and there is an exaggeration.The budget of 9, 10, 11 and 12 months will also be executed. ”",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the context and the terms used. The claim states that the 8-month budget has been executed and there is an exaggeration, and it predicts that the budget for the months 9, 10, 11, and 12 will also be executed.

The term ""exaggeration"" suggests that there is some inaccuracy or overstatement in the execution of the 8-month budget. However, without specific details or evidence, it's difficult to quantify the extent of this exaggeration.

The claim that the budget for the remaining months (9, 10, 11, and 12) will also be executed is a prediction and does not provide concrete evidence to support it. Predictions, by nature, can be uncertain and may not always come true.

Given the lack of concrete evidence and the uncertainty surrounding the predictions, the claim can be considered partially true but also contains elements that are not verifiable or may be overstated.

Without access to specific data or reports that validate this claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, let's consider the following possibilities:

1. **True**: The claim is entirely accurate, and there is verifiable data showing that the Georgian Dream has indeed increased the number of public servants by exactly 14,000.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim is largely accurate, but there might be slight discrepancies in the exact number or the context in which the increase occurred.
3. **Half True**: The claim contains elements of truth but also significant inaccuracies or omissions that affect its overall validity.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim is largely inaccurate, with significant errors in the reported number or context.
5. **False**: The claim is entirely inaccurate, and there is no evidence to support the increase in the number of public servants by 14,000.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, a conservative approach would be to assume that there might be some truth to the claim but also potential inaccuracies or lack of context. Therefore, without additional information, a reasonable assessment would be:

Predicting supplements in state agencies contradict the requirement of the applicable law,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Predicting supplements in state agencies contradicts the requirement of the applicable law,"" we need to consider the context and the applicable laws. Generally, if a state agency predicts the need for supplements (e.g., budgetary supplements, operational supplements), it should align with the legal framework governing such predictions.

If the claim suggests that predicting supplements inherently contradicts the law, it is important to note that many laws and regulations allow for such predictions as part of planning and budgeting processes. However, if the predictions are made in a manner that does not comply with specific legal requirements (e.g., without proper justification, without following procedural rules), then the claim could be true.

Without specific context or details about the applicable law, it is challenging to make a definitive determination. However, based on general principles, predicting supplements is usually a part of normal administrative functions and does not inherently contradict the law.

1. The current account deficit in 2018 was 7.7% of GDP.
2. The current account deficit decreased compared to the previous year.

Without specific data to verify these points, I'll provide a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. Check reliable sources (such as national statistical offices, international financial institutions like the IMF or World Bank) for the current account deficit data for 2018 and the previous year.
2. Compare the figures to determine if the deficit was indeed 7.7% of GDP in 2018.
3. Verify if the deficit decreased compared to the previous year.

If both points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If one point is accurate but the other is not, the claim would be 'Half True'. If one point is mostly accurate but the other is not or only partially accurate, the claim would be 'Mostly True'. If both points are inaccurate or mostly inaccurate, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without this detailed context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, if we assume that the claim is about the Public Broadcaster being consistently named in evaluations over the last 6-8 years, we can consider the following:

1. **True**: If every single evaluation in the last 6-8 years has indeed named the Public Broadcaster.
2. **Mostly True**: If the Public Broadcaster was named in the vast majority of evaluations, with only a few exceptions.
3. **Half True**: If the Public Broadcaster was named in about half of the evaluations.
4. **Mostly False**: If the Public Broadcaster was named in a minority of evaluations.

Without additional information or data to verify the exact percentage of the city budget spent on social programs, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

However, based on the general nature of the claim and the use of the phrase ""about 38%,"" which suggests an approximation, it could be interpreted as a reasonable estimate if it is close to the actual percentage. If the actual percentage is significantly different, the claim could be considered less accurate.

Without specific data for verification, a conservative evaluation would be:

NATO European Analog: A rift between the Western countries has emerged,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim 'NATO European Analog: A rift between the Western countries has emerged,' we need to assess the current political and diplomatic climate within NATO and among Western countries.

As of recent events, there have been varying degrees of disagreement among NATO members and Western countries on issues such as defense spending, strategic priorities, and responses to global crises. For example, there have been public disagreements on burden-sharing, the approach to relations with Russia, and the management of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. However, it's important to note that while disagreements exist, NATO continues to operate and cooperate on key security matters.

Given this context, the claim that a ""rift"" has emerged is somewhat exaggerated but not entirely false. There are tensions and disagreements, but they do not amount to a full-blown rift that would threaten the alliance's core functions.

However, without additional context or specific information about what ""Hriko Slovakia"" refers to, it is challenging to determine the veracity of the claim. ""Hriko Slovakia"" does not appear to be a widely recognized term or entity, and there is no readily available information that supports the claim of a precedent related to it in the context of protecting the court with impartiality.

Given the lack of clarity and supporting evidence, the claim cannot be substantiated. Therefore, the most accurate assessment is:

The claim states that on April 9, 2015, the Union of Journalists of Paraná denounced something, and that most of these denunciations are related to reports from the newspaper Gazeta do Povo from 2012. Additionally, it mentions that this situation is embarrassing.

Without additional context or specific details about what was denounced or the exact nature of the reports, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, based on the structure and content provided, it appears to be a plausible statement about a specific event involving a journalistic union and a newspaper.

Given the lack of specific details to cross-verify, but considering the coherence and plausibility of the statement, we can cautiously label it as 'Mostly True'.

"“In 2012 it was impossible to request any public information from the Audit Office, long ...",mostly false,ka,"To accurately assess the claim, I would need to know the specific context and legal framework of the region where the Audit Office operates in 2012. However, without that specific information, I can provide a general approach to assessing such a claim.

In many countries, freedom of information laws or similar provisions allow citizens to request public information from government agencies, including audit offices. If the claim states that it was ""impossible"" to request any public information from the Audit Office in 2012, it suggests a complete lack of access, which is a strong assertion.

Without specific evidence supporting or refuting this claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, the use of the term ""impossible"" is often an absolute that can be scrutinized. It is more likely that there were significant barriers or restrictions rather than a complete impossibility.

Based on this reasoning, the claim might be overstated. Therefore, a balanced assessment would lean towards:

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False

2. **Vagueness**: The claim also states that this amount is ""in the pocket of the males."" This part is vague and lacks specificity. It does not specify who ""the males"" are, how the money is being pocketed, or provide any evidence to support this allegation.

Given the lack of specificity and evidence for the second part of the claim, it is difficult to verify its truthfulness. The first part, regarding the recovery of two million GEL, could be true, but without the second part being substantiated, the overall claim is weakened.

1. **Source of the Data**: Is the 4.6% growth forecast from a reputable source?
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Is this the highest growth rate in the region compared to other economies?
3. **Timeframe**: Is the claim referring to a specific period, and is it up to date?

Without additional context or data to verify these points, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. However, assuming the statement is made in good faith and based on available data, but lacking independent verification, a cautious approach would be to label it as 'Half True'.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not informed about the president's visit to the US,mostly false,ka,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we would need more context and information. However, as a general guideline, if there is no evidence that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was informed about the president's visit to the US, and there is evidence that they were not informed, the claim could be considered true. Without specific evidence, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.

"“Under your government, the country has lost a billion and a half.These were 700 million specific receipts in the budget and half a billion dollars of foreign exchange reserve to stabilize the GEL exchange rate. """,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the specifics provided. The claim states that under the current government, the country has lost a total of 1.5 billion, composed of 700 million in specific receipts in the budget and half a billion dollars of foreign exchange reserve to stabilize the GEL exchange rate.

Without additional context or data, it's difficult to verify the exact figures mentioned. However, the claim does provide specific amounts, which could potentially be checked against official financial reports or government statements.

Given the lack of context and specific verification, the claim seems detailed enough to be plausible but not definitively provable without further information. Therefore, a balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"In 2016 we had 23 million regional projects in Kakheti, increased in 2017, in 2018 - 35 ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the information provided and assess its credibility and accuracy. The claim states that there were 23 million regional projects in Kakheti in 2016, which increased in 2017, and reached 35 million in 2018.

Without specific data or sources to verify the exact numbers, the claim of having millions of projects in a single region seems highly improbable. It is unlikely that any region, including Kakheti, would have such a high number of projects in a single year, let alone an increase to 35 million in two years.

Given the implausibility of the numbers, the claim is likely exaggerated or inaccurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Anti -dumping legislation is in force in Georgia,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Anti-dumping legislation is in force in Georgia,"" we need to check the legal framework and trade policies of Georgia.

As of my last update in October 2023, Georgia, like many nations, has trade policies in place to protect its domestic industries. Anti-dumping legislation is a common component of these policies, designed to prevent the import of goods at prices below their normal value, which could harm domestic industries.

While I do not have real-time access to current legal databases, it is generally expected that a country like Georgia would have some form of anti-dumping measures in place to comply with international trade regulations and agreements.

Given this context, it is reasonable to assume that anti-dumping legislation is likely in force in Georgia.

Developments in Greece will definitely have an impact on Georgia,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Developments in Greece will definitely have an impact on Georgia,"" we need to consider the context and potential connections between the two countries. Greece and Georgia are geographically distant and have different political, economic, and cultural contexts. However, global interconnectivity means that significant developments in one country can have ripple effects on others, particularly through economic, diplomatic, or geopolitical channels.

While it is plausible that major developments in Greece could have some impact on Georgia, the extent of this impact is likely to be limited and indirect. For example, economic crises in Greece could affect global markets, which in turn could influence Georgia's economy. However, the claim that developments in Greece will ""definitely"" have an impact on Georgia is too strong and not supported by concrete evidence of direct and significant influence.

Therefore, the claim is overstated.

"In the past three years, state debt has increased over 3 billion",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""In the past three years, state debt has increased over 3 billion,"" we need specific data on the state's debt levels over the past three years. Without access to detailed financial reports or official data sources, it is not possible to definitively determine the accuracy of this claim.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to reliable data sources that confirm the state debt has indeed increased by more than 3 billion over the past three years. Given this hypothetical validation, the claim would be considered accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
"Last months, budget deficit spending has not affected the amount of money in circulation ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the relationship between budget deficits and the money supply. Generally, budget deficits can affect the money supply through various mechanisms, such as government borrowing or quantitative easing by the central bank. However, the impact is not always direct or immediate.

1. **Budget Deficits and Money Supply**: When a government runs a budget deficit, it typically borrows money to cover the shortfall. This borrowing can increase the money supply if the central bank purchases government bonds, effectively injecting new money into the economy.

2. **Central Bank Policies**: Central banks can influence the money supply independently of budget deficits through monetary policy tools like open market operations, reserve requirements, and interest rate adjustments.

3. **Economic Conditions**: The impact of budget deficits on the money supply can also be influenced by economic conditions. For example, during economic downturns, increased government spending might not immediately translate into increased money in circulation if banks and businesses are cautious about lending and investing.

Given these factors, it is possible for budget deficit spending to have a delayed or indirect effect on the money supply. Therefore, the claim that ""Last months, budget deficit spending has not affected the amount of money in circulation"" could be accurate under certain conditions but is not universally true.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"The Law on Prosecutor's Office is an imitation of depoliticisms of this body, which is still the system of ruling Paul ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down and analyze its components:

1. **'The Law on Prosecutor's Office is an imitation of depoliticisms of this body'**: This suggests that the law aims to depoliticize the Prosecutor's Office but does so in a superficial or ineffective manner.

2. **'which is still the system of ruling Paul ...'**: This part is unclear without additional context. It seems to imply that the Prosecutor's Office remains under the control or influence of a specific individual or system named 'Paul'.

Without specific details about the law, the context of 'depoliticisms', and the identity or influence of 'Paul', it's challenging to accurately assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the information provided, the claim appears to be a mix of potentially valid criticism (depoliticization efforts being ineffective) and a vague, unsupported assertion about the system being under the control of 'Paul'.

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
"During my presidency, in addition to 2008, more people were returning to Georgia than they were going",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to examine net migration data for Georgia during the presidency in question. Since I don't have real-time data access or specific context about which presidency is being referred to, I can't verify the claim directly.

However, generally speaking, claims about net migration can be checked by looking at official census data, immigration reports, or other demographic studies. If the data shows that there was indeed a net positive migration (more people returning to Georgia than leaving) for most years during the presidency, the claim would be supported.

Without specific data, here's a hypothetical evaluation:

- If the data consistently shows more people returning to Georgia than leaving during most years of the presidency, the claim would be **True** or **Mostly True**.
- If the data is mixed, with some years showing net positive migration and others not, the claim would be **Half True**.
- If the data shows that for most years, more people were leaving than returning, the claim would be **Mostly False** or **False**.

"Spend so much money on agriculture and agriculture has not increased, and its economy is ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Investment in Agriculture**: Whether significant amounts of money have indeed been spent on agriculture.
2. **Agricultural Productivity**: Whether there has been an increase in agricultural output or productivity.
3. **Economic Impact**: The current state of the economy related to agriculture.

The claim suggests that despite significant investment, there has been no increase in agricultural productivity, and the agricultural economy is in a poor state. Without specific data or context, it is challenging to make a precise judgment. However, such claims often oversimplify complex economic and agricultural dynamics.

In many cases, investments in agriculture may take time to show results due to factors like climate change, market fluctuations, and policy implementation delays. Additionally, the overall economy might be influenced by numerous other factors besides agricultural productivity.

Given the lack of specific data and the general nature of the claim, it is reasonable to assume that the statement might contain elements of truth but also likely oversimplifies the situation.

Drug possessions are decriminalized only in the two countries of Europe and the situation has worsened both,half true,ka,"The claim that ""Drug possessions are decriminalized only in the two countries of Europe and the situation has worsened both"" is not entirely accurate. While it is true that some European countries have decriminalized certain drug possessions, the claim that only two countries have done so and that the situation has worsened in both is misleading.

For instance, Portugal is often cited as a country that has decriminalized drug possession, and studies have shown that this policy has had mixed results, with some positive outcomes such as reduced drug-related deaths and HIV infections, but not necessarily a worsening of the overall situation. Additionally, other European countries have adopted various approaches to drug policy, including decriminalization to some extent.

Since we do not have access to the specific conclusion or any additional context, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the statement alone, it suggests that a legal assessment has been made and the project has been deemed constitutional.

Without further evidence to the contrary, the claim appears to be presented as a factual report of a legal conclusion. Therefore, in the absence of contradictory information, the claim can be considered mostly true.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"The state spends 40 million in Georgian football every year, though football is nothing ... We have to finish the swamp in the Football Federation",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two main points: the amount spent by the state on Georgian football and the subjective evaluation of football's impact or importance.

1. **Amount Spent**: The claim states that the state spends 40 million on Georgian football every year. Without specific data to verify this exact figure, we cannot definitively say whether this part of the claim is true or false.

2. **Subjective Evaluation**: The claim that ""football is nothing"" and the need to ""finish the swamp in the Football Federation"" is a subjective opinion. It reflects the speaker's dissatisfaction with the current state of football administration or performance, but it does not provide factual evidence or data to support the claim.

Given the lack of verifiable data on the amount spent and the subjective nature of the second part of the claim, the overall claim cannot be fully substantiated. Therefore, it is reasonable to categorize it as:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
The City Council is not legally authorized to oblige any executive body in the budget ...,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The City Council is not legally authorized to oblige any executive body in the budget,"" we need to consider the legal and constitutional frameworks governing the relationship between city councils and executive bodies. While specific legal authorities can vary depending on jurisdiction, in general, city councils often have significant oversight and approval powers over budgets, including the ability to mandate how funds are allocated.

In many municipal systems, the city council is responsible for approving the budget, which can include directing how funds are spent. This often involves obliging executive bodies to allocate resources in specific ways. However, the exact extent of these powers can differ based on local laws and charters.

Given the general understanding of municipal governance, the claim that the City Council is not legally authorized to oblige any executive body in the budget is likely inaccurate. City councils typically have the authority to oversee and direct budgetary matters.

"""Today [November 13] is more than the taxes received than it was last year.""",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the taxes received on November 13 of the current year with the taxes received on November 13 of the previous year. Without specific data, I cannot definitively determine the truth of the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, I'll assume we have access to relevant data and can make a judgment based on that data.

If the taxes received on November 13 of the current year are indeed higher than the taxes received on November 13 of the previous year, the claim would be considered true. If the taxes are only slightly higher, it might be considered 'Mostly True.' If the taxes are roughly the same or the difference is negligible, it could be 'Half True.' If the taxes are lower than last year, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Without actual data, I'll provide a hypothetical response based on common scenarios:

**Hypothetical Scenario 1:**
- Taxes received this year: $1,000,000
- Taxes received last year: $950,000

In this case, the taxes received are higher this year, so the claim would be 'True.'

**Hypothetical Scenario 2:**
- Taxes received this year: $1,000,000
- Taxes received last year: $1,000,000

In this case, the taxes received are the same, so the claim would be 'Half True.'

**Hypothetical Scenario 3:**
- Taxes received this year: $900,000
- Taxes received last year: $950,000

The phrase ""Georgia has managed to export export to the Russian market"" is repetitive and unclear, and the claim does not specify what Georgia has managed to export. Additionally, the statement ""Today Russia's embargo imposition like this ..."" is incomplete and lacks context.

Without specific details on what Georgia has exported and the current status of any Russian embargo, it is impossible to verify the claim.

This statement is quite broad and can be interpreted in various contexts such as legal, social, or practical scenarios. In many legal and social contexts, actions often require some form of permission or compliance with regulations, even if they do not interfere with movement. For example, building a structure on your property may require permits, and certain activities in public spaces may require permission, even if they do not interfere with movement.

However, without that information, I can provide a general assessment based on typical parliamentary procedures.

In many parliamentary systems, the opposition often demands the creation of temporary investigation commissions to scrutinize various issues. The number of such demands can vary widely depending on the political climate and the issues at hand. Without specific data, it is challenging to verify the exact number of cases.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided, the claim could be considered plausible but not definitively proven. Therefore, a reasonable assessment would be:

The claim states that ""only 42,000 jobs were lost in 3 months,"" which suggests that the number of jobs lost is relatively small. However, without additional context such as the size of the workforce, the expected job growth, or the baseline for comparison, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim.

The phrase ""only 42,000 jobs were lost"" implies that this number is insignificant or lower than expected. If the context is that the expectation was for job growth or a much smaller job loss, then the claim could be seen as misleading. Conversely, if the context is that a much larger job loss was anticipated, the claim might be accurate.

Given the lack of specific context, the most balanced assessment would be to consider the claim as 'Half True' because while it accurately reports a number, it lacks the necessary context to fully understand its significance.

"During the voting by a party representative, the voter lists from the desk lists independently ...",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""During the voting by a party representative, the voter lists from the desk lists independently ...,"" we need more context to fully understand the statement's accuracy. However, based on typical voting procedures, the claim seems to imply that voter lists are managed independently by party representatives. This is not standard practice in most democratic systems, where voter lists are usually handled by independent election authorities to ensure impartiality and fairness.

Given this understanding, the claim appears to be misleading or inaccurate.

If the claim about the seizure amount and timing is accurate based on verifiable sources, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the details are partially correct but not entirely accurate, it would be 'Half True'. If the details are largely inaccurate, it would be 'Mostly False'. If the claim is entirely false, it would be 'False'.

Without specific data or reliable sources to verify the exact salaries of emergency doctors in Tbilisi and Kutaisi, it is challenging to definitively classify the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. However, based on general knowledge of salary variations between major cities and smaller cities, it is plausible that there could be a significant difference in salaries.

Given the lack of specific data, a reasonable approach would be to classify the claim as 'Half True', acknowledging that while there may be a general trend of higher salaries in larger cities like Tbilisi compared to smaller cities like Kutaisi, the exact figures provided cannot be verified without additional information.

If Geostat does indeed publish crime statistics fully and on a quarterly basis, the claim would be true. However, without specific verification, we can only assess the plausibility of the statement.

- If there is clear evidence that no new enterprises have been opened, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there is evidence that a very small number of enterprises have been opened, but the overall impact is negligible, the claim might be 'Mostly True'.

"""Georgia is today with low tax rates in the region""",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Georgia is today with low tax rates in the region,"" we need to consider the context and compare Georgia's tax rates to those of other states in its region.

As of recent data, Georgia has a state income tax rate ranging from 1% to 5.75%, which is relatively low compared to some neighboring states. For example, North Carolina has a flat rate of 4.99%, and South Carolina's rates range from 0% to 7%. Additionally, Georgia's sales tax rate is around 4%, which is also comparatively low.

However, without specific data on all states in the region and a clear definition of what constitutes ""low tax rates,"" it's challenging to definitively say that Georgia has the lowest tax rates. Nevertheless, Georgia's tax rates are generally considered to be on the lower end compared to many other states.

In general, claims about economic indicators such as GDP per capita should be backed by reliable data from recognized sources like government reports, international financial institutions, or reputable economic analysts.

1. **34 million GEL for compensations:** This part of the claim is specific and can be verified through official financial reports or government statements. Without access to those specific documents, we cannot confirm or deny this figure.

2. **Billions have been spoken in Gakharia presentations:** This part of the claim is more vague. It suggests that presentations by Gakharia (presumably a public figure) have mentioned figures in the billions, but it does not specify the context or what these figures refer to (e.g., budgets, investments, etc.).

1. Agriculture has increased significantly since 2013.
2. There was a constant reduction in agriculture from 2004 to 2012.

Without specific data, we can analyze the general trends in agriculture. From 2004 to 2012, there were fluctuations in agricultural output due to various factors such as economic conditions, climate changes, and technological advancements. It is unlikely that there was a constant reduction throughout this entire period.

Since 2013, advancements in technology, improved farming practices, and investments in agriculture have generally led to increased productivity. However, the term ""significantly"" is subjective and would require specific data to verify.

Given these considerations, the claim is likely an oversimplification of more complex trends.

Visa regulations are often introduced for a variety of reasons, including security concerns, immigration control, reciprocity with other countries, and sometimes to regulate tourism and economic activities.

Given that visa regulations can indeed be related to tourism (e.g., managing the influx of tourists) and economic problems (e.g., controlling labor migration to protect the local economy), the claim that they are not related to these factors is not entirely accurate.

Without specific data or reports, it's challenging to definitively label the claim. However, based on the general nature of such claims, it's often prudent to assume that there might be some truth to the issues raised, but the extent and scope could be exaggerated or misrepresented.

Given the lack of specific evidence to fully verify or refute the claim, a cautious approach would be to label it as 'Half True'. This categorization acknowledges that there might be some basis for the claim while also recognizing the potential for exaggeration or inaccuracy.

Without this data, it is difficult to verify the claim.

However, such an extreme claim (237 times the average) would typically require strong and verifiable evidence. If no such evidence is provided or if the claim is based on unverified or biased sources, it would be prudent to consider it as potentially exaggerated or false.

80% of the defense budget is spent on salaries,mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim that ""80% of the defense budget is spent on salaries,"" we would need to refer to specific and current data on defense budget allocations. However, without such data immediately available, we can make a general assessment based on typical defense budget breakdowns.

In many countries, a significant portion of the defense budget is indeed allocated to personnel costs, which include salaries, benefits, and pensions. However, this percentage can vary widely depending on the country and the specific year. For example, in the United States, personnel costs typically account for a large portion of the defense budget, but it is usually less than 80%. Other expenses, such as procurement, research and development, and operations and maintenance, also make up substantial parts of the budget.

Given this general understanding, the claim that ""80% of the defense budget is spent on salaries"" is likely an overestimation. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

"In March we had a 6%growth of the economy and predict an annual 5%forecast, high economic growth ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **6% growth in March**: This is a specific claim that would need to be verified with official economic data. Without access to the actual data, we cannot confirm its accuracy.

2. **Annual 5% forecast**: Economic forecasts are often based on complex models and can vary among different analysts and institutions. Again, without specific data or sources, we cannot verify the accuracy of this forecast.

3. **High economic growth**: This is a subjective term. What constitutes ""high"" economic growth can vary depending on the context and historical comparison. Without a clear definition or context, it is difficult to evaluate this part of the claim.

Given the lack of specific data and sources to verify the claims, the most we can say is that the statement contains elements that could be true but lacks sufficient evidence to be fully verified.

"“Unfortunately, we inherited the economy, with a negative trade balance of 50 percent ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need more context and data. However, I'll analyze it based on general economic principles.

A negative trade balance (or trade deficit) means a country imports more goods and services than it exports. A trade deficit of 50 percent would imply that imports exceed exports by 50 percent of the value of exports.

Without specific data, it's challenging to verify the exact percentage. However, such a high trade deficit is uncommon and would typically indicate significant economic issues.

Given the lack of specific data and the unusual nature of a 50 percent trade deficit, the claim seems exaggerated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Administrative costs decreasing with respect to the budget,mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Administrative costs decreasing with respect to the budget,"" we would need specific data or context to make a concrete determination. However, based on general principles and without specific information, it is common for administrative costs to decrease as a percentage of the budget when the budget increases, due to economies of scale. Therefore, the claim is generally plausible.

"“During the previous government, for 8 years, 70km highway was constructed ... our team ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we would need to verify the actual length of highway constructed during the previous government's 8-year term. However, since I don't have real-time data or the ability to browse the internet for current information, I can't fact-check the specific numbers provided in the claim.

Given the lack of verifiable data, the most cautious approach is to consider the claim as needing further verification. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot definitively categorize it as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Final Answer: Half True (assuming partial accuracy without concrete verification)",,False,True

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to definitively classify the claim.

However, if we assume that Nodar Khaduri, as an expert in the field, has made this statement based on his analysis and understanding of the economic factors affecting the Georgian lari (GEL), we can consider his claim as credible unless proven otherwise.

"""The detainees are mainly released on the basis of a plea agreement""",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""The detainees are mainly released on the basis of a plea agreement,"" we need to consider the context and data related to detainee releases. However, without specific data or a context provided, it's challenging to make an accurate assessment. Generally, plea agreements are a common mechanism for resolving cases in the criminal justice system, but they are not the only method by which detainees are released. Other factors such as time served, parole, and dismissal of charges also play significant roles.

Given the lack of specific data, it is reasonable to assume that while plea agreements are an important factor, they are not the sole or even the primary mechanism for detainee releases in all contexts.

Without specific data or detailed information, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general principles, claims about financial losses should be supported by reliable sources and verifiable data.

If the claim is not supported by credible sources or if the data provided is incomplete or misleading, the claim should be treated with skepticism.

"“According to the first quarter of 2013, in the real sector, except for construction, increases everywhere ...",half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""According to the first quarter of 2013, in the real sector, except for construction, increases everywhere ..."", we need to consider the economic data from that specific time period. Without access to the detailed economic reports of the first quarter of 2013, we can't provide a definitive answer. However, generally speaking, economic trends can vary widely across different sectors, and it's unusual for all sectors except one to show uniform increases.

Based on typical economic variability, the claim that there were increases everywhere except for construction seems unlikely. Therefore, without specific data, the claim is likely overstated.

Prices for basic use of medicines decreased by 20-23%,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Prices for basic use of medicines decreased by 20-23%,"" we would need to examine specific data and evidence that supports or refutes this assertion. Since I don't have access to real-time data or specific context for this claim, I can provide a general approach to how one might assess it:

1. **Verify the Source**: Check the credibility of the source making the claim. Official government reports, recognized medical journals, or reputable news outlets are more likely to provide accurate information.

2. **Data Analysis**: Look for data from pharmaceutical pricing indices, government health departments, or market research firms that track medicine prices.

3. **Consistency**: Ensure that the data is consistent over time and across different reliable sources.

4. **Context**: Consider the context in which the claim is made, such as the time period, region, and types of medicines included.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to reliable data that shows a decrease in prices for basic medicines within the range of 20-23%.

**Final Answer: Mostly True**

- In the 2012 parliamentary elections, the Georgian Dream coalition won approximately 54.97% of the vote.
- In the 2016 parliamentary elections, the Georgian Dream party won approximately 48.67% of the vote.

Based on these figures, the support for the Georgian Dream actually decreased from 2012 to 2016.

"The norm that prohibited taxes without referendum, one of the investors' attraction c ...",true,ka,"To accurately assess the claim, we need to consider the context and specific details about the norm prohibiting taxes without a referendum and its impact on investors' attraction. Without additional context or evidence, it's difficult to provide a precise evaluation. However, based on general principles, here's an analysis:

1. **True**: If there is a well-established norm or law in a specific jurisdiction that clearly prohibits new taxes without a referendum and this norm is widely recognized as a significant factor in attracting investors.

2. **Mostly True**: If the norm exists but its impact on investor attraction is somewhat debated or not universally acknowledged.

3. **Half True**: If the norm exists but its effectiveness in attracting investors is mixed or not conclusively proven.

4. **Mostly False**: If the norm exists but there is substantial evidence that it does not significantly attract investors or is not consistently enforced.

5. **False**: If there is no such norm or the norm does not have any impact on investor attraction.

Given the lack of specific context or evidence, a cautious approach would be to consider it as:

**Final Answer: Mostly True**

Two out of every three people in Georgia die due to diseases caused by tobacco smoking,half true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Two out of every three people in Georgia die due to diseases caused by tobacco smoking,"" we need to consider the prevalence of smoking-related deaths and compare it to overall mortality rates.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smoking is a leading cause of preventable death, but it does not account for two out of every three deaths. The actual proportion of deaths attributable to smoking is significantly lower, typically around 20% in many regions, including Georgia.

Given this information, the claim that ""Two out of every three people in Georgia die due to diseases caused by tobacco smoking"" is significantly exaggerated.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"“Four normative acts are obliged to protect the population from GM, including ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""'Four normative acts are obliged to protect the population from GM, including ...',"" we need to consider the context and the legal framework regarding genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the specific jurisdiction being discussed.

In many jurisdictions, there are indeed several normative acts (laws, regulations, directives, etc.) that aim to protect the population from potential risks associated with GMOs. These acts often include regulations on labeling, safety assessments, environmental impact studies, and monitoring.

However, without specific details on the ""four normative acts"" mentioned in the claim, it is difficult to definitively state whether the claim is entirely true or not. Generally, it is plausible that there are multiple regulations in place to protect the population from GMOs, but the exact number and nature of these acts would depend on the specific legal framework.

Given the general plausibility but lack of specific details, the claim can be considered 'Mostly True'.

"""Georgia is still in 15 countries of biodiversity ...""",half true,ka,"The claim that ""Georgia is still in 15 countries of biodiversity ..."" is not clear in its phrasing. However, if the claim is meant to suggest that Georgia is among the top 15 countries in terms of biodiversity, it is necessary to evaluate that against known data.

As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, Georgia (the country) is known for its biodiversity, particularly in the Caucasus region, but it is not typically listed among the top 15 countries globally for biodiversity. Countries like Brazil, Indonesia, and Colombia are more commonly recognized for their exceptional biodiversity.

Therefore, the claim as interpreted is likely exaggerated or incorrect.

Without access to such data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on typical progress reports and government initiatives, claims about near-complete gasification often turn out to be overly optimistic or partially accurate.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim is likely to fall into one of the following categories:

- **Mostly True**: If significant progress has been made but not yet completed in every village.
- **Half True**: If the progress is notable but still far from complete.
- **Mostly False**: If the progress is minimal or has significant setbacks.

"“According to the United Nations by 2050, the population of Georgia is expected to decrease a million 170 thousand ...",true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""According to the United Nations by 2050, the population of Georgia is expected to decrease a million 170 thousand,"" we need to refer to reliable sources such as United Nations population projections.

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to the latest United Nations reports. However, population projections are typically available through the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA).

For an accurate assessment, one would need to check the most recent UN population projections for Georgia. These projections often include detailed data on expected population changes, including decreases or increases.

Given the specificity of the claim (""a million 170 thousand""), it's important to verify the exact figures from the UN reports. Without access to the latest data, I cannot definitively confirm or refute the claim.

**Final Answer:** Half True (as it requires verification from the most recent UN population projections).",,False,True

If the claim suggests that Nika Gvaramia has not left their post to study abroad, and there is no evidence to contradict this, it could be considered true. However, if there are nuances or missing details that might affect the interpretation, it could fall into a different category.

“In 2013 and 2014 we will pay more money from the budget than we borrow.During this period the government 1 ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the government's budgetary data for 2013 and 2014. The claim states that the government will pay more money from the budget than it borrows during this period. This implies that the government is running a budget surplus.

Let's break down the claim:

1. **Budget Surplus vs. Deficit**: A budget surplus occurs when the government's revenues exceed its expenditures, meaning the government does not need to borrow money. Conversely, a budget deficit occurs when expenditures exceed revenues, requiring the government to borrow money to cover the shortfall.

2. **Historical Data**: To verify the claim, we would need to look at the actual budget data for 2013 and 2014. This data would show whether the government had a surplus (paying more than borrowing) or a deficit (borrowing more than paying).

Without specific data, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, historically, many governments have run budget deficits rather than surpluses, especially in the years following the 2008 financial crisis.

Given the typical economic conditions and government spending patterns, it is unlikely that the government ran a budget surplus in both 2013 and 2014. Therefore, without specific data to support the claim, it is reasonable to consider the claim as unlikely to be true.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,True,False

However, since we don't have access to such detailed information, we can't provide a definitive answer.

Given the limited context provided, the claim appears to be making a specific allegation about a hidden contract signed by a former government in 2012. Without additional evidence or verification, it's difficult to determine the truthfulness of this claim.

Without additional context or data, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, based on the information given, let's analyze the claim:

1. **2014: 30 million**
2. **2015: 100 million**
3. **2016: 50 million**

The claim presents specific amounts for direct purchases by Tbilisi City Hall for three consecutive years. To accurately assess the claim, we would need to cross-reference these figures with official records, budget reports, or other reliable sources.

Given the lack of additional context or verification sources, the claim appears to provide specific amounts without further details on what these amounts refer to (e.g., currency, type of purchase, etc.). This lack of context makes it difficult to fully validate or refute the claim.

We will not promise to free the IDPs from utility taxes,mostly false,ka,"The claim 'We will not promise to free the IDPs from utility taxes' is a statement of intent or policy, not a factual assertion that can be objectively verified as true or false. Therefore, it doesn't fit neatly into the categories of 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. However, if we are to evaluate it based on the clarity and honesty of the statement, it could be considered 'True' in the sense that it is a clear and honest declaration of policy.

"According to general trends, international investments in the world are diminishing, while in Georgia, on the contrary, it is growing",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider data on international investments globally and specifically in Georgia.

1. **Global Trends in International Investments**: According to recent reports, such as those from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), global foreign direct investment (FDI) has been fluctuating and has shown signs of decline in certain periods due to various economic factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions.

2. **Investments in Georgia**: Data from sources like the National Statistics Office of Georgia and international organizations like the World Bank indicate that Georgia has seen an increase in FDI in recent years, despite the global trends. This growth can be attributed to various factors, including economic reforms, favorable business environments, and strategic location.

Based on this information:

- The claim that international investments globally are diminishing is generally supported by data showing a decline or stagnation in global FDI.
- The claim that investments in Georgia are growing is also supported by data indicating an increase in FDI in Georgia.

Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate but may not capture the nuances of fluctuations in global investments.

However, for the sake of the exercise, I'll assume we have access to reliable information that allows us to judge the claim.

If there is evidence showing that City Hall did not complete any infrastructure projects within the specified 8-month period, but there were attempts or ongoing projects that were not finalized, the claim would be considered mostly accurate but not entirely true due to the nuance of ongoing efforts.

1. **Reduction of Prize by 11 Million GEL Compared to 2012:**
   - This part of the claim can be verified by comparing the prize amounts from 2012 to the current year. If the data shows a reduction of 11 million GEL, this part is true.

2. **Immorality of Bonuses and the Specific Case of David Dagelashvili:**
   - The claim suggests that bonuses are immoral and points out a specific instance where Ms. Irma's family member received a prize of 10 thousand GEL in public service. The morality of bonuses is subjective and can vary based on individual perspectives. However, the specific case of David Dagelashvili receiving a prize can be fact-checked.

Given the information provided, we cannot definitively verify the reduction in prize money or the specific case of David Dagelashvili without additional data. However, the claim mixes objective facts (prize reduction) with subjective interpretations (morality of bonuses), making it complex to evaluate as entirely true or false.

However, numerous factors can influence car trade, such as economic conditions, consumer preferences, market trends, and technological advancements, among others. While the authorities' policies and decisions can certainly impact the car trade, it is not accurate to attribute the entire responsibility to their inability without considering other contributing factors.

1. **Context**: The claim suggests that there has been a lack of large-scale training initiatives for judges.
2. **Evidence**: Various countries and jurisdictions have different approaches to judicial training. For instance, some countries have established judicial academies and continuous professional development programs for judges. However, the effectiveness and scale of these programs can vary widely.

Given the variability in judicial training programs globally, it is likely that some jurisdictions have indeed undertaken large-scale training initiatives, while others may have lagged behind. Therefore, the claim that ""nothing has been done"" is likely an overgeneralization.

1. **Verification of the 60% Increase**: Check if there are credible sources or official data from Georgia's National Wine Agency or other relevant authorities that confirm a 60% increase in wine exports.

2. **Specific Growth in China and France**: Verify if there is data or reports indicating significant growth in wine exports to China and France specifically.

Without access to specific data or reports, I cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, based on the general need for verification, here is a guideline for assessing such claims:

- **True**: The claim is supported by official data and multiple credible sources.
- **Mostly True**: The claim is largely supported by data, but there may be minor discrepancies or incomplete information.
