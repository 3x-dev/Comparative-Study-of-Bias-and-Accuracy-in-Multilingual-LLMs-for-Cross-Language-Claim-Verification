"Photo by George Floyd, who recently died in police torture in Miniapolis, USA",mostly false,bn,"Final Answer: Mostly False. While it is true that George Floyd died in Minneapolis, USA, and his death was related to police actions, it is not accurate to describe the incident as ""police torture."" The correct term, based on legal proceedings and widespread understanding, is ""police brutality"" or ""excessive use of force."" Additionally, the phrase ""Photo by George Floyd"" is misleading as it suggests that George Floyd took the photo, which is not relevant to his tragic death.",,False,True
"In this video, producer-director Mahesh Bhatt is expressing displeasure for the trailer of the film 'Sadak 2' to be displayed on a large scale.",false,hi,"Final Answer: Mostly False.

Explanation: Mahesh Bhatt did express concerns about the negative reactions and controversy surrounding the trailer of 'Sadak 2', but he did not specifically express displeasure about the trailer being displayed on a large scale. The displeasure was more about the public reaction and the controversy, not the scale of the trailer's display.",,False,True

This image of the Alaska mountain horn is lifted from the plane to look like a sleeping woman,mostly false,bn,"The claim seems to be describing a phenomenon known as pareidolia, where people perceive familiar patterns, such as faces or figures, in random images or objects. In this case, the claim is that an image of the Alaska mountain horn appears to resemble a sleeping woman when viewed from a certain angle or perspective.

Without the specific image, it's difficult to verify the claim definitively. However, pareidolia is a well-documented phenomenon, and it's plausible that a mountain formation could resemble a sleeping woman from a particular viewpoint.

Given the plausibility of pareidolia and the subjective nature of visual perception, the claim could be considered mostly true, as it is based on a real phenomenon but cannot be universally verified without the image in question.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
The Israeli Prime Minister's son's photo is serving in the army.,half true,hi,"To evaluate the claim ""The Israeli Prime Minister's son's photo is serving in the army,"" we need to consider the context and available information. The claim could be interpreted in a couple of ways: either that there is a photo of the Prime Minister's son serving in the army, or that the son himself is currently serving in the army.

Without specific details or recent updates on the Israeli Prime Minister's family, it's challenging to verify the exact situation. However, it is generally known that many Israeli citizens, including those from prominent families, serve in the military as part of mandatory conscription.

Given the ambiguity and the general knowledge about military service in Israel, the claim could be partially accurate but lacks specific details for full verification.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
Photo ship is the world's largest ship,mostly false,bn,"The claim 'Photo ship is the world's largest ship' is inaccurate because the term 'Photo ship' does not refer to a specific ship recognized as the world's largest. The title of the world's largest ship typically goes to specific vessels known for their size, such as the Seawise Giant (later known as the Jahre Viking) or more recently, container ships like the Ever Ace.

While there have been efforts to clean the river and the ghats, the problem is ongoing and significant. Therefore, the claim that the Ghats are filled with dirt is largely accurate but may not capture the nuances of the ongoing efforts to improve the situation.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Indian Army is harassing Kashmiri women,mostly false,hi,"To evaluate the claim 'Indian Army is harassing Kashmiri women,' it's important to rely on credible sources and evidence. As of my last update, there have been allegations of human rights abuses in Kashmir, including by the Indian Army, but these claims are typically investigated by independent organizations and often disputed by the Indian government. Without specific, verifiable evidence supporting the claim that the Indian Army is systematically harassing Kashmiri women, it's difficult to categorize this claim as entirely true.

Given the complexity and the lack of universally accepted evidence, this claim would be best categorized as 'Half True.' This acknowledges that while there may be some instances or allegations of harassment, it does not imply a widespread, systematic practice.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Fake notes from a temple in Gujarat during lockdown have been seized,mostly false,bn,"To determine the veracity of the claim ""Fake notes from a temple in Gujarat during lockdown have been seized,"" I would need more specific information or evidence to evaluate it accurately. Without additional context or sources, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, based on the general nature of such claims and the need for verification, the claim could range from 'Half True' to 'Mostly False' depending on the details and sources. For instance, if there were isolated incidents reported but not widespread or fully verified, it might lean towards 'Half True.' If there is no credible evidence or if the claim is based on misinformation, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

**Final Answer:** Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
Best BJP leader Muralinohar Joshi is eating sweet to Modi because of the start of the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya,half true,bn,"The claim contains a mix of factual and unverifiable or potentially misleading information. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Factual**: The construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya did start under the BJP government led by Narendra Modi.
2. **Unverifiable/Potentially Misleading**:
   - The phrase ""Best BJP leader Muralinohar Joshi"" is subjective and not factually verifiable.
   - ""Eating sweet to Modi"" is an idiomatic expression that suggests praise or appreciation, but it's not clear if Murli Manohar Joshi actually praised Modi in this specific context.

Given these points, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains some elements of truth. Therefore, the claim can be considered 'Half True'.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"Tabligh Jamaat -e -Islami posts on Facebook about Muslims, Indian industrialist BR Sethi is blacklisted by the Dubai government.",mostly false,bn,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. **Tabligh Jamaat -e -Islami posts on Facebook about Muslims**: This part of the claim is about the activities of Tabligh Jamaat on Facebook. Tabligh Jamaat is a global Islamic missionary movement. It is plausible that they post about Muslims on Facebook, as it aligns with their mission. However, without specific evidence, we cannot confirm the exact content or frequency of such posts.

2. **Indian industrialist BR Sethi is blacklisted by the Dubai government**: This part of the claim is about a specific action taken by the Dubai government against an individual. To verify this, we would need credible sources such as official government announcements or reputable news reports. Without such evidence, we cannot confirm the accuracy of this claim.

Given the lack of specific evidence for both parts of the claim, we cannot definitively say that the statement is true. Therefore, the claim is at best unverified and at worst potentially false.

Some Muslim people say CAA-NRC is not wrong.,mostly false,bn,"The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) have been contentious issues in India, with varying opinions among different segments of the population, including Muslims. While some Muslim individuals and groups have expressed support for these measures, many others have voiced strong opposition. The claim that ""Some Muslim people say CAA-NRC is not wrong"" is not entirely false, as there are indeed some Muslims who support these policies. However, it is also not entirely true, as it does not represent the majority opinion among Muslims in India.

"In the video, a huge waterfall water is seen falling on the Shivling.The video has been described as Pashupati Nath Temple in Nepal.",false,hi,"The claim that the video shows a huge waterfall falling on the Shivling at Pashupati Nath Temple in Nepal is not accurate. The Pashupati Nath Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, but it does not have a waterfall falling on the Shivling. The temple is located on the banks of the Bagmati River, but there is no waterfall at the temple itself. Therefore, the claim is false.

A video on social media is widely as a claim that a deceased party was alive before the final funeral.,half true,pa,"The statement you provided appears to be incomplete or grammatically incorrect, making it difficult to assess its truthfulness accurately. However, based on the information given, the claim seems to suggest that a video on social media shows that a deceased party was alive before the final funeral. Without additional context or evidence, it is challenging to determine the validity of this claim.

However, if we assume the claim is implying that the deceased person was seen alive in the video before their funeral, this would likely be 'False' or 'Mostly False' unless there is substantial evidence to support the claim.

As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have real-time access to current events or specific data to verify this claim. However, it is crucial to rely on reputable news sources, official statements, or investigative reports to establish the truth of such a serious allegation.

Without specific details or evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment. However, such claims often require substantial evidence to be considered true.

The claim suggests that listening to an audio clip can benefit ""you and your family"" in terms of ""goodness,"" which is vague and subjective. Additionally, it implies that this activity should take precedence over ""1000 work,"" which is not reasonable as it dismisses the importance of other responsibilities.

In this video West Bengal police can be seen bombing protesters,half true,bn,"To evaluate the claim accurately, more context and specific details are needed. The term ""bombing"" is typically used to describe the use of explosive devices, which is a severe and specific action. Without further details or evidence, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on general knowledge and typical police responses to protests, the use of the term ""bombing"" is likely an exaggeration. Police forces generally use non-lethal methods such as tear gas, water cannons, or batons to disperse protesters.

Tata Motors can go up to 5 km if the electric car called Evision's Evens can go up to 5 km and it has a 5 -year warranty on the battery.,mostly false,bn,"The claim seems to mix up different elements and does not provide a clear, single assertion that can be easily verified as true or false. It mentions ""Tata Motors can go up to 5 km,"" which is unclear without context, and then talks about an ""electric car called Evision's Evens"" with a 5-year warranty on the battery. The claim lacks coherence and specificity.

Given the lack of clear information and the jumbled nature of the statement, it is difficult to assess its truthfulness accurately. Therefore, the claim is best categorized as:

Such behavior would be a significant breach of protocol and would have been widely reported by mainstream media outlets. Without specific video evidence or credible sources corroborating this claim, it is safe to assume that this did not happen.

"It was a step for the good of Punjab to offer the Ram Rahim by Sukhbir Badal: Prem Singh Chandumajra, former MPs",false,pa,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the facts surrounding the statement. The claim involves two main components: the action of offering something (in this case, 'Ram Rahim') for the good of Punjab, and the attribution of this action to Sukhbir Badal by Prem Singh Chandumajra, former MPs.

Without specific details or sources to verify the context of 'offering the Ram Rahim' and the exact statements made by Prem Singh Chandumajra and Sukhbir Badal, it is challenging to definitively classify the claim. However, based on the general understanding of political claims and the need for concrete evidence, the claim appears to be speculative or potentially misleading without further corroboration.

Without this information, it is challenging to provide a precise answer.

However, based on general historical knowledge, the East India Company did engage in trade with India. Therefore, if the film is a historical depiction, it is plausible that an East India Company ship is shown trading in India.

The claim mentions ""taken on the 21st,"" which seems to imply a specific date or context that isn't further clarified. Without knowing the specific film and the context of the 21st, it's difficult to verify the complete accuracy of the claim.

Without specific evidence or sources to verify this claim, I cannot definitively say whether it is true or not. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to reliable sources that can confirm or deny the events described.

If reliable sources confirm that there were riots in Bengaluru on August 11 and that a truck was set on fire by a mob, the claim would be considered true. Conversely, if the sources refute these events, the claim would be false.

For the purpose of this response, I will assume we have verified the claim with reliable sources.

However, without specific evidence or verification from reliable sources, it's challenging to determine the authenticity of the claim. Generally, CPI-M leaders supporting China in such a manner would be highly unusual and likely to attract significant attention and controversy.

Given the lack of specific evidence or widespread reporting to support this claim, it is reasonable to conclude that it is likely false or exaggerated.

If sufficient evidence supports the claim that the photo is indeed from a public meeting of Kanhaiya Kumar in Varanasi, it would be considered true or mostly true. Conversely, if the photo is from a different event or location, it would be considered false or mostly false.

Without additional information or context, it's impossible to definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we assume the claim is being made in the context of known events or locations, we can provide an educated guess.

If the claim is referring to a specific video and there is evidence that the video was indeed filmed in Shaheenbagh and shows women, then the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If there is no evidence or the evidence is conflicting, the claim could range from 'Half True' to 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without such evidence, I cannot definitively assess the accuracy of the claim.

However, if we consider the general plausibility and the context provided:

1. **Plausibility**: It is plausible that a video of a decaying road in Delhi could exist, given the well-documented issues with infrastructure in many parts of the world, including Delhi.
2. **Specific Incident**: The specific claim about two women falling into a gutter would need to be verified through reliable sources, such as news reports, official statements, or the video itself.

This image made by Japanese neurologist helps to learn about emotional stress,mostly false,bn,"To evaluate the claim ""This image made by Japanese neurologist helps to learn about emotional stress,"" we need to consider a few factors:

1. **Existence of the Image**: Whether the image in question actually exists and was created by a Japanese neurologist.
2. **Relevance to Emotional Stress**: Whether the image effectively helps to learn about emotional stress.

Without specific details about the image or its creator, it's challenging to verify the claim fully. However, if we assume the image is real and was indeed created by a Japanese neurologist, we can consider the following:

- Japanese neurologists have made significant contributions to the field of neuroscience and psychology, including studies on emotional stress.
- If the image is designed to illustrate or explain aspects of emotional stress, it could be a valuable educational tool.

Given these points, the claim seems plausible but lacks specific verification. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be 'Mostly True,' as it is reasonable to believe that such an image could exist and serve the stated purpose.

A picture of Germany where foreign children are adopting Sanatan civilization in Gurukul.,half true,hi,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Presence of Gurukuls in Germany**: While there are some Hindu organizations and educational institutions in Germany, the traditional Indian Gurukul system is not widespread.

2. **Adoption of Sanatan Civilization**: Sanatan Dharma, also known as Hinduism, is a complex and diverse set of beliefs and practices. While there may be individuals or small groups interested in Hindu culture and philosophy, it is unlikely that a significant number of foreign children are adopting it wholesale.

3. **Scale and Representativeness**: The claim suggests a broad trend, which would require substantial evidence to support. Anecdotal instances or small-scale occurrences would not justify the claim as generally true.

Given these considerations, the claim that ""foreign children are adopting Sanatan civilization in Gurukul"" in Germany is likely an overstatement. While there may be some interest and isolated cases, it does not represent a widespread phenomenon.

"By giving a picture of the camera crew at the time of cleaning the middle of PM Modi, such an indication that this is a 'photo-up'",mostly false,hi,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and evidence provided. The claim suggests that the presence of a camera crew during PM Modi's cleaning activity implies that it was staged for a photograph ('photo-up'). Without additional context or evidence, such as statements from the camera crew, PM Modi, or independent observers, it is difficult to definitively conclude that the event was staged solely for a photograph.

However, the presence of a camera crew does not inherently prove that the event was staged. It is common for public figures to have their activities documented by media crews. Without further evidence, the claim that the event was a 'photo-up' is speculative.

1. **Plausibility of the Mixture**: Tea mixed with lemon and baking soda is a common home remedy for various ailments. Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and lemon juice are generally safe for consumption in small amounts.

2. **Known Effects**: While consuming large amounts of baking soda can be dangerous due to its high sodium content, moderate use in tea is generally considered safe. Lemon juice is also safe in normal quantities.

3. **Specific Claim**: The claim that ""no one died in Israel"" from this specific mixture is difficult to verify without specific data. However, it is reasonable to infer that if such deaths had occurred, they would likely be reported in medical literature or news outlets.

Given the above points, the claim is likely true. There is no widespread evidence or reports of deaths specifically from this mixture.

1. **Chanod - A beautiful scene of Malhar Ghat**: This is subjective and depends on personal interpretation. However, it's likely true that Chanod offers a scenic view of Malhar Ghat.
2. **The Narmada river in its original form**: This is ambiguous. Rivers change over time due to natural processes and human activities. The term ""original form"" is not clearly defined.
3. **Namo Namami Narmad side**: This appears to be a reference to the Namami Devi Narmade Sewa Yatra, a campaign to conserve the Narmada River. It doesn't add factual context to the claim.

Given the subjective and ambiguous nature of parts of the claim, it's difficult to declare it entirely true or false. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

1. **Authenticity of Videos**: The authenticity of the videos must be verified. Misinformation and propaganda are common, and videos can be manipulated or taken out of context.

2. **Context**: The context in which the videos were recorded is crucial. Without understanding the broader situation, it is difficult to ascertain the full truth of the claim.

3. **Bias**: Videos can present a biased viewpoint, showing only one side of the story. A comprehensive analysis would require multiple perspectives and sources.

Given these considerations, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim as 'True' or 'False' without conducting a thorough investigation. However, based on the general principles of verifying claims and the potential for misinformation, the claim would likely fall into one of the following categories:

The Hathras case in Uttar Pradesh, India, refers to a highly publicized incident where a young woman was allegedly gang-raped and severely injured. She later succumbed to her injuries. This event sparked significant outrage and media attention.

1. The claim that a young woman from Hathras was gang-raped is widely reported and generally accepted as true based on media reports and official statements.
2. The phrase ""an incredible deal with the victim"" is vague and unclear. It does not provide a specific context or detail that can be verified.
3. The claim that she ""finally took the last breath"" is true, as it is widely reported that the victim passed away due to her injuries.

Given the vagueness of the second point, the claim cannot be fully verified as entirely true or false. However, the key elements of the gang-rape and the victim's death are supported by widely reported facts.

Dr. at Breach Candy Hospital.Video of Sharad Udawadia about corona Video viral,false,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. Whether Dr. Sharad Udawadia is associated with Breach Candy Hospital.
2. Whether a video of Dr. Sharad Udawadia discussing the coronavirus has gone viral.

Without specific details or context about the video's content or the exact claims made in it, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge and common practices in verifying such claims:

- Dr. Sharad Udawadia is a known medical professional, and it is plausible that he could be associated with Breach Candy Hospital.
- Videos by medical professionals discussing the coronavirus have been known to go viral, especially during the pandemic.

Given these points, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' if Dr. Udawadia is indeed associated with Breach Candy Hospital and a video of him discussing the coronavirus has gone viral. However, without specific verification of the video's content and its virality, a precise determination is challenging.

The claim suggests that barcode stickers starting with certain numbers (690 for China and 890 for India) indicate the country of origin.

The term ""Animal Breedgas"" is not a recognized term, and the phrase ""to Protect Animals from Getting.Thanks Pum"" is grammatically incorrect and nonsensical.

Kanhaiya Kumar giving a speech with a map showing Kashmir part of Pakistan,false,hi,"To determine the veracity of the claim that ""Kanhaiya Kumar gave a speech with a map showing Kashmir as part of Pakistan,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. Did Kanhaiya Kumar give such a speech?
2. Was there a map present during the speech?
3. Did the map show Kashmir as part of Pakistan?

Without specific evidence or credible sources confirming these details, it is challenging to assess the claim accurately. However, given the sensitive nature of the Kashmir issue and the potential political ramifications, any such claim would likely be widely reported and verified by multiple sources if true.

In the absence of concrete evidence and widespread corroboration, the claim should be treated with skepticism.

Video of the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau infected with Corona virus.,half true,hi,"The claim that there is a video of the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau infected with the coronavirus is complex because it involves multiple components: the existence of a video and the factual basis of the infection.

To verify this claim accurately, we would need to check two things:
1. Whether Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, the wife of Justin Trudeau, was indeed infected with the coronavirus.
2. Whether there is a video showing her infection or related to her infection.

Regarding the first point, it is true that Sophie Grégoire Trudeau tested positive for COVID-19 in March 2020. This was widely reported by credible news sources.

Regarding the second point, there is no widely circulated or verified video of Sophie Grégoire Trudeau specifically showing her infection. While there may be news reports or videos discussing her infection, there is no evidence of a video explicitly showing her in a state of infection.

Given these points, the claim is partially accurate in that Sophie Grégoire Trudeau did test positive for COVID-19, but there is no verified video showing her infection. Therefore, the claim is 'Mostly False' because the video aspect is unverified and likely inaccurate.

3. **Identification**: Is the person in the picture actually Dikhhi Das?
4. **Action**: Is the person in the picture cutting a cake that resembles the national flag?

Without the actual picture and additional context, it's impossible to verify the claim accurately. However, cutting a cake that resembles a national flag is generally considered disrespectful in many cultures. If the claim is based solely on the description without visual evidence, it cannot be substantiated.

Given the lack of sufficient information to verify the claim, the most appropriate categorization would be:

1. **Check Official Statements**: Look for official statements from the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and TMC (Trinamool Congress Party) regarding the defections.
2. **Review Reputable News Sources**: Check news articles from credible sources that might report on this event.

1. **Linguistic Errors**: The claim is not well-constructed and contains grammatical errors, which can indicate a lack of credibility.
2. **Factual Context**: Without specific evidence or sources, it is challenging to verify whether such an event took place in Colombia.
3. **Historical Context**: Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar is a highly respected figure in India, but his recognition in Colombia would be unusual without substantial evidence.

Given the lack of clarity and the presence of linguistic errors, the claim cannot be considered accurate without further verification.

Without additional context or details about the video, it is challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume that the claim refers to a widely circulated or officially released video of the Ram Mandir Bhoomi Pujan event in Ayodhya, we can assess its credibility based on known facts.

The Ram Mandir Bhoomi Pujan event in Ayodhya was a significant and widely covered event, with official videos and images released by various sources, including the government and media outlets. If the claim refers to one of these official or widely circulated videos, it is likely to be accurate.

Whether it is a lockdown or not: Six months must be taken by the Indian Council of Medical Research.,half true,gu,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the possibility of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) taking six months for a specific task, regardless of a lockdown. However, without specific details about the task or context, it's challenging to determine the absolute truth of the statement. Generally, the duration required for research or administrative processes by an organization like ICMR can vary widely depending on the nature of the task.

Given the lack of specific context, the claim that 'Six months must be taken by the Indian Council of Medical Research' could be considered plausible for certain complex tasks but is not universally applicable. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true or false but rather context-dependent.

2. In the picture, he is filling the election form of Sonia Gandhi.

Without specific evidence or verification from credible sources, it's difficult to ascertain the truthfulness of these claims. However, based on general knowledge and typical practices, it's unusual for a high-ranking judge like Justice S.

Typically, law enforcement or health officials might visit a residence to enforce quarantine measures, conduct contact tracing, or provide information about COVID-19, but not to ""get rid of Corona"" in a literal sense.

Without additional context or evidence, the claim appears to be either exaggerated or misinterpreted. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be that the claim is either 'Mostly False' or 'False' based on the unusual and implausible phrasing.

Badwizer admitted that several employees have been urinating in their beer tanks over the years,false,bn,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the credibility of the source, any available evidence, and the likelihood of the scenario. Without specific evidence or a credible source verifying that ""Badwizer"" (presumably a misspelling of a well-known beer brand) employees have been urinating in beer tanks over the years, such a claim is highly dubious. Beer companies have strict quality control measures to prevent contamination, and such an act would be a serious violation of food safety regulations.

Without specific context or evidence, it is difficult to verify the authenticity or the widespread circulation of such a picture. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim cannot be definitively proven.

"Due to heavy rains in Mumbai, water turns around, water was flooded at Selink",false,gu,"The claim ""Due to heavy rains in Mumbai, water turns around, water was flooded at Selink"" contains some factual elements but also has confusing phrasing. It is true that heavy rains in Mumbai can cause flooding. However, the phrase ""water turns around"" is unclear and does not make sense in this context. Additionally, ""Selink"" does not appear to be a recognized location in Mumbai.

Given these issues, the claim is not entirely accurate or clear.

It mentions ""the price of premoline,"" ""a cigarette is visible in Mann Mann,"" and an unclear connection between a famous singer, social media, and the Aam Aadmi Party leader.

However, based on the information provided, the claim appears to be a mix of unrelated and confusing elements. Therefore, it is likely that the claim is not accurate.

The phrase ""mary chachi hai hai"" is a colloquial expression that implies something is becoming ridiculous or exaggerated.

To determine if the claim is true, mostly true, half true, mostly false, or false, we need context regarding what Kangana Ranaut has said and whether it is indeed exaggerated or ridiculous. Without specific information on Kangana Ranaut's statements, it is impossible to make an accurate judgment.

Therefore, based on the available information, the claim cannot be definitively evaluated.

Modi's poster installed in Aligarh Muslim University,false,hi,"To determine the veracity of the claim that ""Modi's poster installed in Aligarh Muslim University,"" we need to rely on credible sources and verified reports. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no specific, widely reported incident of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's poster being installed in Aligarh Muslim University that can be definitively confirmed or denied without additional context or evidence.

Given the lack of specific, widely corroborated information, the claim cannot be fully substantiated or refuted based on general knowledge alone. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

"If one's mother or sister posted her photo on DP WhatsApp, ask her to replace it right away",half true,gu,"The claim suggests that if a mother or sister posts her photo on a WhatsApp display picture (DP), she should be asked to replace it right away. This claim implies that it is inappropriate or unsafe for them to do so. However, there is no universal rule or widely accepted norm that requires women to remove their photos from WhatsApp DPs. The appropriateness of such an action depends on personal preferences, cultural contexts, and individual circumstances. Therefore, the claim is not universally applicable and lacks a factual basis for generalization.

Last date for filing income tax returns increased to 30 September 2019,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Last date for filing income tax returns increased to 30 September 2019,"" we need to consider the context of the specific tax year and any official announcements made by the relevant tax authorities.

As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to the most current information. However, historically, tax filing deadlines can be extended due to various reasons such as natural disasters, administrative changes, or other special circumstances.

If the claim refers to a specific extension announced by the tax authority for the 2019 tax year, it would be considered accurate if supported by official sources. If there is no official announcement or supporting evidence, the claim would be inaccurate.

Without specific context or official verification, the default stance would be to consider the claim as needing verification.

1. **Context**: The claim involves a child seeking help on Facebook for their mother affected by Covid-19.
2. **Verifiability**: Without specific details or verification from reliable sources, it's difficult to confirm the authenticity of the claim.
3. **Possibility**: It is plausible that such a scenario could occur, but without concrete evidence, we cannot confirm it as entirely true.

Given the lack of verifiable information, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false. Therefore, it falls into the category of being partially believable but not fully verifiable.

"The person who is visible in the viral video is informed of his son's guilty.At the same time, the person is talking to the maximum share of the post.",half true,pa,"The claim provided is not entirely clear and seems to be missing some context, which makes it difficult to assess its truthfulness accurately. However, based on the information given, it appears to suggest that a person in a viral video is being informed of his son's guilt while also talking to the maximum share of the post. The phrase ""maximum share of the post"" is not clear in this context, which complicates the evaluation.

Given the lack of clarity and the ambiguous nature of the claim, it is challenging to determine its truthfulness without additional context. Therefore, the most accurate assessment based on the information provided would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"Poor chariots, poor chariots will be converted into an express train on the way to the closure.",half true,bn,"The claim ""Poor chariots, poor chariots will be converted into an express train on the way to the closure"" appears to be metaphorical rather than literal.

However, taken literally, the claim that poor chariots will be converted into an express train is not factually accurate or plausible.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"CPM leader Sitaram Yechuri made the tweet on October 28, as Shi Jinping called his 'boss'.",false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we should consider the following points:

1. **Source Verification**: Check if Sitaram Yechuri, the leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), actually made the tweet on October 28.
2. **Content Verification**: Verify if the tweet mentioned Shi Jinping (likely a typo of Xi Jinping) and referred to him as his ""boss.""

Without access to real-time internet data or specific verification tools, it's challenging to confirm the exact details of the tweet. However, based on general knowledge and the standard practices of fact-checking:

- **Typographical Error**: The name ""Shi Jinping"" is likely a typo, as the correct name is ""Xi Jinping.""
- **Contextual Plausibility**: It is plausible that a political leader might comment on another world leader, but calling Xi Jinping his ""boss"" would be unusual and might be taken out of context or be a misunderstanding.

Given the lack of direct verification tools, the claim can be evaluated as follows:

- **True**: If the tweet exists exactly as described, with the typo corrected.
- **Mostly True**: If the tweet exists but has minor inaccuracies or contextual errors.
- **Half True**: If the tweet exists but has significant contextual or factual errors.
- **Mostly False**: If the tweet does not exist and the claim is largely fabricated.
- **False**: If the tweet does not exist at all.

Without further evidence, the claim cannot be fully verified. However, based on the likelihood of errors and the plausibility of the context, it seems more likely to be misinterpreted or exaggerated.

This picture of Bihar shows the 15 -year development of Nitish Raj.,mostly false,hi,"To evaluate the claim 'This picture of Bihar shows the 15-year development of Nitish Raj,' we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Scope**: The claim implies that a single picture can encapsulate 15 years of development under Nitish Kumar's leadership in Bihar.
2. **Visual Representation**: A single picture cannot comprehensively show all aspects of development over a 15-year period. Development encompasses various sectors like infrastructure, education, healthcare, economy, and social welfare, which cannot be fully represented in one image.
3. **Accuracy of Attribution**: While Nitish Kumar has been a significant figure in Bihar's politics and has contributed to its development, attributing all development solely to him without acknowledging other factors and contributors would be an oversimplification.

Given these considerations, the claim is overly simplistic and does not accurately reflect the complexity of development over a 15-year period.

"A picture of a child drinking milk on a railway track in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh.This shows the migrant crisis in India.",half true,hi,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the details provided. The claim states that a picture of a child drinking milk on a railway track in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh, illustrates the migrant crisis in India.

1. **Context**: The migrant crisis in India refers to the mass movement of migrant workers, often due to economic hardship or social conditions, which was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. **Evidence**: A single image of a child drinking milk on a railway track could be interpreted in various ways. Without additional context, it's challenging to definitively link this image to the migrant crisis. The image could be a snapshot of a specific moment in time and may not necessarily represent a broader crisis.

3. **Interpretation**: While the image might evoke sympathy and highlight potential hardships, it does not provide concrete evidence of a widespread migrant crisis. More context, such as accompanying news reports or statistics, would be needed to substantiate the claim.

Given these points, the claim is not entirely false but lacks sufficient context to be considered fully true. Therefore, the most accurate assessment is:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,True,False

1. **Context**: The claim states that a picture of a girl is being circulated on social media with the assertion that she has died.
2. **Verification**: Without specific verification from credible sources, such as official statements from the hospital, family, or reliable news outlets, the claim remains unsubstantiated.

Given the lack of credible evidence and the reliance solely on social media circulation, the claim is likely unverified and potentially misleading.

However, based on the phrase itself, it appears to be a general statement about decorations in Ayodhya related to Shri Ram, possibly for a religious or cultural event. Without additional information, it's challenging to verify the truthfulness of this statement.

That said, if we assume the statement is about the decorations in Ayodhya for a religious event or festival, it is plausible that such decorations exist, especially considering the cultural and historical significance of Ayodhya in relation to Shri Ram.

1. **Context of NRC in Assam**: The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a register containing names of all Indian citizens. The NRC update process in Assam, completed in 2019, aimed to identify illegal immigrants.

2. **Police Action**: The claim suggests that there is a video showing police evacuating people from their homes after the NRC was implemented.

3. **Verification of Video**: Without specific details about the video mentioned in the claim, it is challenging to verify its authenticity or context. Claims about videos often need to be cross-referenced with reliable sources or fact-checking organizations.

Without specific details or evidence, it is challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, there have been various reports and allegations of persecution and human rights violations in states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India. These claims include incidents of communal violence, harassment of minority communities, and restrictions on freedoms.

Given the complexity and the mixed nature of the evidence, it is fair to say that while there are reports of persecution, they may not represent the entirety of the situation in BJP-ruled states. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true.

The picture is from Kashmir where RSS goons are kidnapping women on Indian Army uniform.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to break down the components of the statement:

1. **RSS goons**: The RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) is a right-wing, Hindu nationalist, paramilitary volunteer organization. The use of the term ""goons"" is derogatory and suggests criminal or violent behavior.
2. **Kidnapping women**: This is a serious allegation that requires concrete evidence.
3. **Indian Army uniform**: This implies impersonation of the Indian Army, which is a grave offense.

Without specific evidence or credible sources to back up the claim that RSS members are kidnapping women while impersonating the Indian Army in Kashmir, such a statement should be treated with skepticism.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**

The claim contains elements that are highly unlikely without supporting evidence and makes serious allegations that need to be substantiated by reliable sources.",,False,True

Ambulance stopped to give way to Rahul Gandhi's convoy,mostly false,hi,"To evaluate the claim ""Ambulance stopped to give way to Rahul Gandhi's convoy,"" we need context and evidence to determine its veracity. Without additional information, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, based on the general principle that ambulances should have priority due to the urgency of their missions, any claim suggesting otherwise would be highly unusual and potentially concerning.

Given the lack of specific details or evidence, the claim could be considered dubious unless supported by reliable sources. Therefore, without further information, the claim is likely either 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

The claim suggests that a ghost is responsible for stopping irrigation water in Assam, which is a supernatural and unverifiable assertion.

Supernatural claims, such as ghosts affecting real-world events like irrigation, are not supported by empirical evidence and are generally considered unfounded. Therefore, the claim that a ghost is stopping irrigation water in Assam is likely false.

Without specific details or sources to corroborate the event or the numbers mentioned (such as ""1000 Gadiyas"" of the ""Sath Karani Karani Sena Maharashtra Ravana""), it is difficult to ascertain the truthfulness of the claim. Additionally, the use of phrases like ""Jai Bhavani Jai Rajputana. Let's go. Jai Shriram"" adds a layer of ambiguity rather than providing concrete information.

"This video is from Lonavla Bhus Dam and if people continue to behave like this, Korona will not go from India.",half true,mr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into two parts:

1. **The video is from Lonavla Bhus Dam**: Without verifying the video itself, we cannot confirm the location. Therefore, this part of the claim cannot be verified as true or false without additional information.

2. **If people continue to behave like this, Korona will not go from India**: This part of the claim suggests that if people do not follow safety measures (such as social distancing, wearing masks, etc.), COVID-19 (Korona) will continue to spread in India. This is generally supported by public health guidelines and epidemiological data.

Given the lack of verifiable information about the video's location, but acknowledging the general truth about the importance of following safety measures to control the spread of COVID-19, the claim can be considered mostly true.

Video of Muslim rally against NPR and NRC in Delhi,mostly false,hi,"To accurately assess the claim ""Video of Muslim rally against NPR and NRC in Delhi,"" additional context and evidence are required. Without specific details or verification sources, it's challenging to determine the veracity of the claim. However, based on the general nature of claims regarding protests and rallies, here's a possible approach:

1. **True**: If the video genuinely shows a Muslim rally against the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Delhi, and there is reliable evidence or reporting to support this claim.

2. **Mostly True**: If the video shows a rally but there might be some inaccuracies or exaggerations, such as the scale of the rally or specific details about the protesters.

3. **Half True**: If the video shows a rally but its context or purpose is not entirely clear, or if there are conflicting reports about the nature of the rally.

4. **Mostly False**: If the video shows a rally but important details are misrepresented, such as the location or the primary issue being protested.

5. **False**: If the video does not show a rally at all, or if the rally shown has nothing to do with NPR, NRC, or Muslims in Delhi.

Municipalities and municipalities get Rs 1.5 lakh behind every corona patient,false,mr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and available information regarding government policies or financial support related to COVID-19 patients in different regions. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely recognized or documented policy that universally applies Rs 1.5 lakh (150,000 rupees) per COVID-19 patient to municipalities across all regions.

Government support and compensation vary by country, state, and locality. Without specific details on the region or the context in which this claim is made, it is challenging to verify its accuracy. However, general knowledge suggests that such a blanket policy is unlikely to be in place across all municipalities globally.

This first Prime Minister runs the country for 5 years without borrowing any money from the World Bank,mostly false,bn,"To evaluate the claim that ""This first Prime Minister runs the country for 5 years without borrowing any money from the World Bank,"" we need to consider historical context and specific data regarding World Bank loans and the tenure of prime ministers.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, no specific prime minister is named in the claim, making it difficult to verify against historical records. However, it is generally known that many countries, including developing nations, have had to borrow from the World Bank at various points in their history due to economic needs and development projects.

Without specific information about the prime minister or the country in question, it is challenging to definitively confirm or deny the claim. However, given the broad nature of the statement and the likelihood that most countries have engaged in some form of borrowing from the World Bank, the claim that a prime minister ran the country for five years without any borrowing seems unlikely without specific evidence.

Explanation: The claim states that the video is of Bhedaghat waterfall in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.

Article 30 (A) does not allow the Gita to teach in schools.,mostly false,hi,"The claim that ""Article 30 (A) does not allow the Gita to teach in schools"" requires clarification based on the context of Indian constitutional law. Article 30(A) of the Indian Constitution does not specifically mention the teaching of the Gita or any other religious text in schools. Instead, it deals with the rights of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions.

The teaching of religious texts in schools is generally governed by educational policies and guidelines rather than a specific constitutional provision like Article 30(A). Schools may choose to include religious texts as part of their curriculum, depending on their educational philosophy and the guidelines set by educational authorities.

Therefore, the claim that Article 30(A) does not allow the Gita to be taught in schools is misleading because Article 30(A) does not address this issue directly.

The use of the Unani removal in Malegaon was cured of corona patients and no new patient was found,half true,mr,"The claim that ""The use of the Unani removal in Malegaon was cured of corona patients and no new patient was found"" is highly questionable without substantial evidence. Unani medicine is a traditional system of healing that has its roots in ancient Greece and Persia, but its effectiveness in treating or curing COVID-19 is not supported by scientific evidence. Furthermore, the claim that no new patients were found in Malegaon due to Unani medicine lacks credible sources to back it up.

While specific incidents can vary, there have been numerous documented cases of Palestinian youth, including girls, engaging in acts of defiance or protest against Israeli security forces, often in the context of protecting religious sites like the al-Aqsa mosque.

However, without a specific incident being referenced, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim. The general theme of Palestinian youth resisting Israeli security forces is well-documented, but the specific details of this claim cannot be precisely confirmed without additional context.

Given this, the claim can be considered generally true but lacking specific verification.

The statement asserts that a picture shows women arrested for involvement in the sex business in the ""jewel chalk area of Kashmir.""

Without specific evidence or a credible source to verify the claim, it is difficult to confirm its accuracy. The term ""jewel chalk area of Kashmir"" is not a commonly recognized geographical term, which adds to the ambiguity. Additionally, claims about arrests related to sex businesses should be corroborated by official reports, news articles, or statements from law enforcement agencies.

Navratri is a Hindu festival that is typically celebrated with great fervor and public gatherings, which does not align with the idea of it being ""closed in the stock.""

Given the ambiguity and the lack of clarity in the claim, it is difficult to ascertain its truthfulness. However, based on the standard understanding of Navratri celebrations, the claim as stated does not make logical sense.

However, if the question is asking whether the phrase ""Listen to what the doctor from Lilavati Hospital Mumbai said in clear words"" is a claim that can be evaluated for truthfulness, the phrase itself does not contain verifiable information that can be labeled as true or false. It is a directive rather than a claim.

While maintaining good hygiene and a healthy diet can be beneficial for overall health, there is no specific evidence to suggest that keeping a throat (assuming it means keeping the throat moist or clear) or avoiding spicy and fried food will directly prevent the coronavirus.

Without such evidence, it is difficult to assess the claim accurately.

However, based on general knowledge and the lack of widespread reports of such incidents, it is unlikely that a large number of Corona patients would be found on public roads. Therefore, without concrete evidence to support the claim, it seems more likely to be exaggerated or inaccurate.

2. **Police Involvement**: Did the police participate or escort the procession?
3. **Video Evidence**: Is there a video that accurately depicts this event?

Without specific details or sources to verify the claim, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on general knowledge and typical practices, Muharram processions are common in many regions, including Kashmir, and police often provide security or escorts for such events.

If the video exists and accurately shows police escorting a Muharram procession in Kashmir, the claim could be considered true. If there are discrepancies or lack of evidence, it might be rated lower.

However, I can provide a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. **Verify the Source**: Check if the video's uploader or any credible source has confirmed the location.

However, based on general knowledge and typical educational standards, it is highly unusual for someone who has not passed the 10th standard to receive a doctoral degree. Doctoral degrees typically require a significant amount of advanced education and research, which includes completing high school, a bachelor's degree, and often a master's degree.

In general, to verify such a claim, one should:
1. Check the source of the video.

Picture of Blue Whale taken from helicopter.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim 'Picture of Blue Whale taken from helicopter,' we need to consider the feasibility and available evidence for such a photograph.

Blue whales are the largest animals on Earth, and they spend much of their time near the surface of the ocean. It is entirely possible for a helicopter to capture a photograph of a blue whale from above. There are numerous documented instances of aerial photography capturing marine life, including blue whales.

Given this context, the claim is plausible and likely true.

1. The longest anaconda ever recorded was around 17 feet, not 134 feet.
2. The heaviest anaconda was about 250 kg, not 2,067 kg.
3. Anacondas are not known to kill hundreds of humans; they typically avoid human contact.
4. A 37-day struggle with an anaconda is highly improbable.

Viral Video is the focal point of nature cyclone in Alibaug,half true,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Viral Video is the focal point of nature cyclone in Alibaug,"" we need more context and verification. However, based on the statement alone, it seems to be claiming that a viral video is the central point or main topic of a nature cyclone in Alibaug. This phrasing is somewhat unclear and could be interpreted in different ways.

If the claim is suggesting that a viral video is an actual focal point of a natural cyclone, it would be false, as cyclones are natural weather phenomena and not influenced by viral videos. If the claim is meant to imply that a viral video is capturing or highlighting the cyclone in Alibaug, it could be true, but we would need specific evidence to confirm that the video is indeed viral and accurately depicts the cyclone.

Without additional context or verification, the claim cannot be fully substantiated. Therefore, the most accurate assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"It is being claimed that in this epidemic, UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a normal citizen in the market.",half true,pa,"The claim that ""UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a normal citizen in the market"" during the epidemic is not accurate. As the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson holds a significant political office and is not considered a ""normal citizen"" in terms of his role and responsibilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he was involved in leading the government's response, which included implementing policies, addressing the public, and coordinating with other officials.

Video of a Muslim domestic assistant mixing his urine in the food of a Hindu home owner.,half true,hi,"To determine the veracity of the claim 'Video of a Muslim domestic assistant mixing his urine in the food of a Hindu home owner,' we need to consider several factors, including the source of the video, the context, and any available fact-checking reports.

Without specific evidence or a credible source verifying the authenticity of the video and the actions depicted in it, such claims often circulate as misinformation or hate speech aimed at inciting communal tensions. Fact-checking organizations frequently debunk such videos, revealing that they are either staged, misattributed, or taken out of context.

Given the lack of concrete evidence and the history of similar claims being debunked, it is reasonable to conclude that this claim is likely false.

"With the connivance of the Election Commission, hundreds of EVMs in Madhya Pradesh have been kept in strong rooms.",mostly false,hi,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider a few points:

1. **Election Commission's Role**: The Election Commission of India is responsible for conducting free and fair elections. It follows strict protocols for the storage and security of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).

2. **Storage in Strong Rooms**: After voting, EVMs are indeed stored in strong rooms under heavy security to prevent tampering until the counting of votes.

3. **Connivance Allegation**: The claim suggests that the Election Commission is involved in some form of impropriety, which is a serious allegation that requires concrete evidence.

Without specific evidence to support the allegation of ""connivance,"" the claim appears to mix factual procedures ( storage of EVMs in strong rooms) with an unsubstantiated accusation.

**Final Answer: Mostly False**

While it is true that EVMs are stored in strong rooms, the allegation of connivance by the Election Commission lacks substantiated evidence.",,False,True
Bhutan stopped the water coming into Assam.,false,mr,"To evaluate the claim 'Bhutan stopped the water coming into Assam,' we need to consider the context and available information about water management between Bhutan and Assam. Bhutan and India have agreements regarding the management of transboundary rivers, and there have been instances where Bhutan has controlled water flow for various reasons such as hydroelectric projects or maintenance.

However, the claim that Bhutan ""stopped"" the water coming into Assam implies a complete halt, which is unlikely due to the continuous nature of river flow and the complexities of water management. It is more plausible that there have been adjustments or reductions in water flow rather than a complete stop.

Given this context, the claim is not entirely accurate but may contain elements of truth regarding water flow management.

3. **Verification**: Without specific details about what ""lacanet"" refers to or evidence of the new rules being implemented by July 31, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Sunni Waqf Board has decided to build Babri Hospital on 5 acres of land,mostly false,bn,"The claim that the Sunni Waqf Board has decided to build Babri Hospital on 5 acres of land is not entirely accurate. The Sunni Waqf Board did propose to build a hospital on the 5-acre plot awarded to them by the Supreme Court in the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi case. However, the proposal faced internal disagreements and was not unanimously supported by the board. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that the board has definitively decided to build the hospital.

""Pistol Tani"" is actually a reference to a popular image of a police officer widely shared on social media, particularly on older platforms like Orkut.

2. **""India Needs to Stop Alloving The Gowarnement to District Us from the North and Total Failure.""** - This is a complex and unclear statement. It seems to be a critique of the government, but the specific allegations are not clear enough to fact-check. The term ""gowarnement"" is likely a typo for ""government,"" and ""district"" might be intended to mean ""distract"" or ""distress,"" but the overall meaning is ambiguous.

The statement ""A man committed suicide against NRC and CAA"" suggests that an individual took their own life in protest against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Without specific evidence or a verified source, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of this claim. However, if we are to evaluate the claim generally:

1. **True**: The claim would be true if there is documented evidence that an individual committed suicide specifically in protest against the NRC and CAA.

The couple is beating the Pakistani police to become a Hindu,mostly false,bn,"To evaluate the claim ""The couple is beating the Pakistani police to become a Hindu,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context**: The claim suggests that a couple is engaged in some form of confrontation or competition with the Pakistani police.
2. **Logic**: The phrase ""beating the Pakistani police to become a Hindu"" is grammatically and logically problematic. It implies a direct action against the police to achieve a religious conversion, which is not a typical or plausible scenario.
3. **Plausibility**: It is highly unlikely that a couple would engage in a physical or competitive act against the police to convert to Hinduism. Conversion to a religion is generally a personal and spiritual decision, not a result of a physical confrontation.

Given these considerations, the claim does not align with any realistic or common understanding of religious conversion or interactions with law enforcement.

Without such evidence, it is difficult to make a definitive assessment.

Given that no specific details or context are provided in the claim, and considering the sensitivity and potential impact of such a statement, it is prudent to assume that the claim is unfounded unless proven otherwise with credible sources.

Wing Commander Abhinandan's wife appealed not to do politics on the sacrifice of soldiers,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify whether Wing Commander Abhinandan's wife made such an appeal. As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or verified statement from Wing Commander Abhinandan's wife specifically appealing not to do politics on the sacrifice of soldiers. Therefore, without concrete evidence or a reliable source confirming this claim, it is reasonable to consider it as 'False'.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
The video was described as the Indo -Pak war in Sialkot.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a video depicts the Indo-Pak war in Sialkot, we need to consider several factors, such as the historical context, the availability of footage from the war, and the credibility of the source making the claim.

1. **Historical Context**: The Indo-Pak wars, particularly those in 1965 and 1971, did involve significant military operations. Sialkot was a notable location during these conflicts.

2. **Availability of Footage**: Authentic footage from these wars is relatively rare and often comes from official military archives or well-documented sources.

3. **Credibility of the Source**: The credibility of the claim depends on the source providing the video. If the source is reliable and can provide verification, the claim might be more trustworthy.

Without specific details about the video or the source, it's challenging to definitively label the claim. However, given that misinformation about historical events is common, especially regarding contentious issues like wars, a claim about a video showing the Indo-Pak war in Sialkot should be approached with caution unless corroborated by multiple reliable sources.

India's first corona vaccine 'Kovishild' will be available in the market in the next 73 days.,false,hi,"To evaluate the claim 'India's first corona vaccine 'Kovishild' will be available in the market in the next 73 days,' we need to consider the context and available information at the time of the claim. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I don't have real-time data or specific information about the release timeline of 'Kovishield.'

However, based on general principles of vaccine development and regulatory processes, predictions about the exact number of days until a vaccine becomes available can be uncertain and subject to change. Therefore, without specific, verified information confirming the 73-day timeline, the claim is likely overly specific and potentially misleading.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Rare pictures of Babri Masjid,mostly false,hi,"To determine the veracity of the claim ""Rare pictures of Babri Masjid,"" we need to consider the availability and authenticity of such images. The Babri Masjid was a significant historical structure in Ayodhya, India, before its demolition in 1992. Photographs of the masjid do exist, although their rarity can vary.

Given the historical significance and the extensive media coverage around the Babri Masjid, it is likely that there are numerous photographs available, some of which might be considered rare. Therefore, the claim that there are ""rare pictures of Babri Masjid"" is plausible.

Without access to the video or additional context, it's challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, based on general principles of fact-checking:

1. **Source Credibility**: Is the source of the claim credible? If it's from a reliable news outlet or official statement, it's more likely to be true.
2. **Context**: What is the context of the video? Is there evidence that the man is indeed a member of the Tabligi Jamaat?
3. **Verification**: Has the claim been independently verified by multiple sources?

Without these details, it's difficult to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, given the lack of verifiable information in the claim itself, it's prudent to approach it with caution.

However, Amit Shah, as a prominent political figure, has been known to make contentious statements, but without a specific quote or reference, we cannot confirm the accuracy of this claim.

However, if we take the claim at face value and assume it means that Oishi Ghosh had an injury that was reported or observed in both the left and right hands at different times, this could be considered potentially misleading without further information. Therefore, a reasonable categorization would be:

Rahul Gandhi does not even know that blood bottle is not hung up at the time of blood donation.,false,hi,"The claim that 'Rahul Gandhi does not even know that blood bottle is not hung up at the time of blood donation' is a statement that requires specific context and evidence to evaluate accurately. However, as a general medical fact, blood is typically collected in a bag placed below the donor, not hung up. Without specific evidence of Rahul Gandhi's knowledge or statements on the matter, it's challenging to definitively categorize this claim. However, based on general medical procedures, the claim about blood collection is incorrect.

Video of Indian Air Force Apache helicopters patrolling Pangong Tso in Ladakh.,mostly false,hi,"To verify the claim about a video of Indian Air Force Apache helicopters patrolling Pangong Tso in Ladakh, we need to consider several factors, such as the credibility of the source, the context of the video, and any corroborating evidence.

1. **Source Credibility**: If the video is from a reputable news agency or a government-affiliated source, it is more likely to be accurate.
2. **Context**: The video should provide context such as date, location, and specific details about the Apache helicopters and their mission.
3. **Corroborating Evidence**: Check if there are other reports or official statements confirming the deployment of Apache helicopters in the Pangong Tso area.

Without access to the specific video or additional context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge and the likelihood of such operations given the geopolitical situation, we can make an informed assessment.

**Final Answer: Mostly True**

This assessment is based on the plausibility of the Indian Air Force deploying Apache helicopters in a sensitive border area like Pangong Tso in Ladakh, given the ongoing tensions and the capability of Apache helicopters to perform surveillance and patrol missions. However, without viewing the video and confirming its authenticity, we cannot provide a definitive 'True' rating.",,False,True

A picture in which PM Modi is seen bowing with folded hands in front of Chinese President Xi Jingping.,false,hi,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we would need to examine the context and authenticity of the photograph. Without specific evidence or context, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, it is not uncommon for leaders to greet each other with respect, which might involve bowing or folding hands in certain cultural contexts.

If the photograph is genuine and shows PM Modi bowing with folded hands, it could be interpreted as a sign of respect rather than submission. However, without seeing the photograph or having additional context, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment.

The Ram Mandir Bhumi Pujan was a significant event that took place in Ayodhya, India, marking the foundation-laying ceremony for the Ram Temple. This event was widely covered in the media and included various celebratory activities, such as laser shows.

Given the high-profile nature of the event and the extensive media coverage, it is likely that a laser show was indeed part of the celebrations. Therefore, the claim that the video is from Ayodhya and was organized for the Ram Mandir Bhumi Pujan is plausible.

Mahatma Gandhi's photo with grandson Kanu Gandhi is of Dandi March of 1930.,mostly false,hi,"To evaluate the claim that ""Mahatma Gandhi's photo with grandson Kanu Gandhi is of the Dandi March of 1930,"" it is crucial to consider historical records and documentation.

The Dandi March, also known as the Salt March, was a significant act of nonviolent civil disobedience led by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930. Historical photographs and accounts of the Dandi March do not typically feature Kanu Gandhi, Gandhi's grandson, who was born in 1917 and would have been around 13 years old at the time.

While Kanu Gandhi did accompany Mahatma Gandhi on various occasions and was part of his entourage, there is no specific documentation or widely recognized photograph that ties Kanu Gandhi directly to the Dandi March of 1930.

Given the lack of historical evidence supporting the claim that a specific photo of Mahatma Gandhi with Kanu Gandhi is from the Dandi March of 1930, the claim can be considered not fully accurate.

Without specific details or a widely recognized incident that supports this claim, it is difficult to affirm its truthfulness.

In general, BJP President Amit Shah has been known to express respect and admiration for LK Advani, a senior leader and one of the founders of the BJP. Public insults, especially on stage, are typically well-documented and widely reported due to their political significance.

1. Whether Adani Agri Logistics Limited is setting up a grain godown in Punjab.
2. Whether this action is contingent on the passage of agricultural bills from Parliament.

Without specific real-time information or access to current events, it's challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, based on general knowledge and typical business practices, companies like Adani Agri Logistics Limited often make strategic decisions based on market conditions and regulatory environments. The passage of agricultural bills could influence their decisions, but it's not always a direct cause-and-effect relationship.

Given the lack of specific details, the claim might be partially accurate but not entirely verifiable without additional context.

Claiming Crona Virus Patient was arrested by the team of Punjab Police and Doctors.,half true,pa,"To evaluate the claim ""Claiming Crona Virus Patient was arrested by the team of Punjab Police and Doctors,"" we need to consider the context and typical procedures for handling COVID-19 patients. Generally, law enforcement and medical teams work together to ensure public safety and health, but the term ""arrested"" is unusual in this context.

Typically, COVID-19 patients are isolated or quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus, and law enforcement may assist in enforcing these measures if necessary. However, the term ""arrested"" implies a criminal proceeding, which is not standard practice for medical cases like COVID-19 unless there are extenuating circumstances such as violating quarantine orders or endangering others.

Without specific details or official sources confirming an arrest, the claim seems exaggerated or misleading. It is more likely that the patient was quarantined or isolated rather than arrested.

Without specific data or reports, it is difficult to confirm or deny this claim accurately.

However, generally speaking, during the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world, including in India, have implemented lockdown measures and social distancing guidelines to control the spread of the virus. Religious gatherings, including Muslim prayers, have been subject to these restrictions. While there may have been isolated incidents of non-compliance, it is not accurate to generalize that an entire community is disregarding the rules without specific evidence.

Generally, such claims require substantial evidence, official statements, or reports from credible sources to be considered true.

Since I don't have real-time internet access to verify this information, I'll provide a general approach on how to evaluate such claims.

1. **Check Official Medical Sources**: Look for announcements from hospitals, medical associations, or official government health websites.
2. **Verify with Credible News Outlets**: Search for articles or obituaries in reputable newspapers or news websites.
3. **Consult Social Media Profiles**: Sometimes, official statements are made on social media platforms by the individual's family, colleagues, or institutions they were associated with.
4. **Cross-Reference Information**: Ensure that multiple reliable sources confirm the claim.

The night scene of India Pakistan border,mostly false,bn,"To evaluate the claim ""The night scene of India Pakistan border,"" we need to consider what is generally known and observable about the border between India and Pakistan at night.

The India-Pakistan border, particularly the Wagah-Attari border, is known for its ceremonial activities during the day, such as the lowering of the flags ceremony. However, at night, the border is typically quiet and not characterized by any specific notable scenes or activities that are widely recognized or observable from a distance.

Given this, the claim that there is a distinctive ""night scene"" at the India-Pakistan border is not substantiated by widely known or observable facts.

Without access to specific evidence or sources, it is challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, based on general principles of fact-checking, if the video is authentic and the context accurately described, the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if there is evidence of manipulation, misinterpretation, or lack of context, the claim could be false or partially true.

Given the lack of specific details and corroborating evidence in the provided information, a cautious approach would be to categorize the claim as needing further investigation.

President Ram Nath Kovind is forced to face big leaders of BJP.,mostly false,hi,"To evaluate the claim 'President Ram Nath Kovind is forced to face big leaders of BJP,' we need to consider the context and the typical roles and responsibilities of the President of India.

The President of India, while holding a ceremonial position, is expected to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The President is not typically in a position to be ""forced"" to face any political party leaders, including those of the BJP, in a confrontational manner. The President's role is largely ceremonial and apolitical, focusing on upholding the Constitution and acting as a symbol of national unity.

Given this context, the claim suggests an unusual and potentially inaccurate dynamic between the President and political leaders. Without specific evidence or context that supports this claim, it is unlikely to be true.

This tribal daughter of Karnataka has come to the IAS exam.,half true,pa,"To accurately assess the claim, ""This tribal daughter of Karnataka has come to the IAS exam,"" additional context or specific details about the individual in question would be necessary. However, if we interpret the claim in a general sense, it suggests that a woman from a tribal background in Karnataka has participated in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) exam.

Given that individuals from various backgrounds, including tribal communities, do participate in the IAS exam, the claim could be plausible but lacks specificity to be definitively verified. Therefore, without concrete evidence or details, a cautious assessment would be:

There is no credible evidence to support the claim that China deliberately spread the coronavirus around the world, nor that a flood or any other natural disaster was sent as a divine punishment in response.

1. The names ""Jahan Chambers,"" ""Johan Chambers,"" and ""Nuhan Chambers"" are not clearly associated with any known public figures or officials.
2. The statement mentions ""Sisco's former,"" which is unclear and does not refer to any recognizable entity or organization.
3. The claim lacks specific details about when or where this statement was made, which makes it difficult to verify.
4. There is no known record of a prominent figure named John Chambers making such a statement about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Given these points, the claim appears to be unfounded and lacks credible sources.

It also includes vague and exaggerated language, such as asserting that a particular group or individual has ""a lot of money in the world"" without any quantifiable data.

Without such verification, it is impossible to conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim.

Given the lack of verifiable information in the prompt, the most appropriate response would be to classify it as uncertain or unverified. However, since the options do not include an ""unverified"" category, the closest evaluation based on the available information would be:

Specifically, we need to know the source of the claim, the details of the incident, and any corroborating evidence such as news reports or official statements. Without this information, it's impossible to accurately assess the claim.

If the claim is based on a specific event that has been widely reported and corroborated by multiple reliable sources, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True.' Conversely, if there is no evidence to support the claim or if the details are disputed, it could be considered 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Given the lack of specific details, the claim cannot be definitively evaluated. Therefore, the best assessment without further information is:

Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Ahmed Javed took only one rupee salary during the job for 36 years.,mostly false,hi,"Final Answer: Mostly False.

While it's possible for individuals to take a symbolic salary of one rupee, it's highly unlikely and impractical for someone to do so for 36 years, especially in a high-ranking position like Mumbai Police Commissioner. Such claims should be verified with official sources or reliable evidence, which is lacking in this case.",,False,True
"In Haryana, the BJP MLA and the officials were washed away by the people ....",half true,gu,"To evaluate the claim, it's important to consider the context and specific details. The phrase ""washed away by the people"" suggests a metaphorical or figurative meaning, possibly indicating a significant loss or defeat in an election or a major public backlash.

Without specific details or context, such as election results, public protests, or other events, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we interpret ""washed away"" as a metaphor for a significant political defeat or loss of public support, we would need to look at recent political events in Haryana.

If there is evidence of a significant electoral defeat or widespread public backlash against the BJP MLA and officials in Haryana, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'Half True,' depending on the extent and nature of the events. If there is no such evidence, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Video of passengers arguing with attachment dents to not take care of social dispensing in Air India aircraft.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to analyze the statement carefully:

1. **Grammatical and Contextual Analysis**: The sentence ""Video of passengers arguing with attachment dents to not take care of social dispensing in Air India aircraft."" seems grammatically incorrect and contextually unclear. The phrase ""attachment dents"" and ""social dispensing"" do not make sense in this context.

2. **Logical Analysis**: It is highly unlikely that passengers would be arguing about ""attachment dents"" or ""social dispensing"" in any meaningful way. It appears that the statement might be a result of poor translation or a misunderstanding.

Given the lack of clarity and the nonsensical nature of the statement, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is false.

Without such context, it is impossible to definitively assess the claim. However, assuming a general approach, the claim could be considered:

This assessment is based on the possibility that while the building might be associated with Shahrukh Khan in some way, the claim lacks sufficient detail to be fully verified as true or false.",,False,True
The claim that Punjab Police have arrested a suspect at Phillaur that was throwing on the road by spitting on the notes,half true,pa,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim, I would need to check recent, credible news sources or official statements from the Punjab Police. However, as I am an AI and cannot browse the internet in real-time, I cannot verify the claim's authenticity at this moment.

Nevertheless, the claim contains specific details (like the location, Phillaur, and the unusual act of spitting on notes), which makes it theoretically verifiable. If such an event indeed happened, it should be reported by local news outlets or confirmed by the Punjab Police.

Since I can't verify it currently, I would refrain from labeling it as 'True' or 'False'. In cases like this, it's always a good idea to fact-check claims using reliable sources.

Mahendra Singh Dhoni tweeted that he will not retire till the T20 World Cup.,false,hi,"To evaluate the claim that ""Mahendra Singh Dhoni tweeted that he will not retire till the T20 World Cup,"" we need to verify if such a tweet exists and if Dhoni made that specific statement. Without direct access to Twitter or specific verification tools, we can rely on general knowledge and recent news updates.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has not made any public statement via Twitter or any other platform indicating that he will not retire until the T20 World Cup. Dhoni has been relatively quiet about his retirement plans, and no such tweet has been widely reported or confirmed.

Given this information, the claim that Dhoni tweeted about not retiring until the T20 World Cup is likely false.

1. **Officials taking passports**: This could be a standard procedure for verification or other purposes.
2. **Passengers got excited**: This is subjective and depends on individual reactions. Some passengers might get excited, others might be concerned or indifferent.

Without additional context or evidence, it's challenging to definitively label the entire claim as true or false. However, it's reasonable to assume that while officials taking passports might happen, the reaction of all passengers being excited is less certain.

As of my last knowledge update in October 2023, there have been no widely reported or confirmed instances of Deepika Padukone explicitly seeking votes for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Given the lack of credible evidence supporting this claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is false.

"Due to increase in gold prices, there is no customers in the jewelery shop, so shop workers are dancing and passing time.",mostly false,hi,"The claim suggests that due to an increase in gold prices, there are no customers in a jewelry shop, leading to shop workers dancing and passing time. While it's possible that higher gold prices might reduce customer traffic, the idea that shop workers would dance and pass time seems exaggerated and not representative of typical behavior in a professional setting. Therefore, the claim is likely an exaggeration or a misrepresentation of the actual situation.

"Through the picture, it is being claimed that after a Hindu girl marrying a Muslim, this has happened.",mostly false,hi,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the evidence provided. The claim suggests that a specific outcome or event occurred solely because a Hindu girl married a Muslim. Without additional context, evidence, or specific details about what ""this"" refers to, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.

However, making broad generalizations about the outcomes of interfaith marriages without concrete evidence is typically misleading. Therefore, without specific evidence to support the claim, it is likely an overgeneralization or misrepresentation.

Women sang Ram bhajan in a mosque in Dubai.,mostly false,hi,"To assess the claim ""Women sang Ram bhajan in a mosque in Dubai,"" we need to examine if there is any documented evidence or credible sources supporting this event. Without specific details or context, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, religious practices and customs generally dictate that non-Islamic religious activities, such as singing Hindu bhajans, do not typically occur within mosques.

Given the lack of verifiable information and the general understanding of religious practices, the claim seems unlikely. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim should be considered:

The statement contains inconsistencies and lacks clarity. The phrase ""A videos on social media is being viral"" is grammatically incorrect and unclear. Additionally, the claim that ""doctors of Sudha hospital doctors have been removed from Rajasthan"" is vague and does not provide specific details about why or how they were removed.

"A photo of a 12 -year -old Swedish child, whose blue eyes were beaten by a Muslim immigrant.",mostly false,hi,"To evaluate the claim 'A photo of a 12-year-old Swedish child, whose blue eyes were beaten by a Muslim immigrant,' we need to consider several factors, including verifiability, context, and potential biases.

1. **Verifiability**: The claim lacks specific details such as names, dates, or locations that would allow for independent verification. Without these details, it is difficult to confirm the authenticity of the claim.

2. **Context**: The phrasing of the claim suggests a potential bias or sensationalism, which is often a red flag for misinformation. The focus on the child's blue eyes and the attacker's religious background could be used to evoke emotional responses rather than present factual information.

3. **Potential Biases**: The claim could be part of a larger narrative aimed at stirring anti-immigrant or anti-Muslim sentiment. Such claims often circulate in online spaces and should be approached with caution.

Given the lack of verifiable details and the potential for bias, the claim cannot be substantiated. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim is likely false or at best, highly questionable.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Ship Service Initiation**: Prime Minister Modi has indeed initiated various waterway projects, including the Ro-Ro (Roll-on/Roll-off) ferry service between Ghogha (near Bhavnagar) and Dahej (near Bharuch).

2. **Distance Covered**: The ferry service significantly reduces the travel time and distance between these points by avoiding the longer road route. However, the exact figures mentioned in the claim (350 km reduced to 32 km) are not entirely accurate. The actual ferry route is approximately 30-31 kilometers, which reduces the road distance of about 360 kilometers.

Given these details, the claim is partially correct but contains some inaccuracies.

Without such evidence, it is difficult to confirm the claim.

While it is true that during lockdowns, many people are confined to their homes and wildlife, including birds like peacocks, have been seen venturing into urban areas due to reduced human activity, the specific claim about peacocks on the Ooty-Coimbatore Road would require local confirmation. However, the general trend described is accurate, so the claim is 'Mostly True'.",,False,True

Video of Manoj Tiwari reaching the mosque when BJP's condition is bad in Haryana elections,mostly false,hi,"To accurately assess the claim ""Video of Manoj Tiwari reaching the mosque when BJP's condition is bad in Haryana elections,"" we need to consider several factors, including the authenticity of the video, the context in which it was recorded, and the political situation in Haryana at the time. Without concrete evidence, such as verified reports, official statements, or trusted media coverage, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

However, based on the information provided, here are some considerations:

1. **Context**: Political figures visiting places of worship, including mosques, is not uncommon, especially during election periods. It could be part of a broader outreach strategy.
2. **Authenticity**: The authenticity of the video and the context in which it was recorded need to be verified. It's crucial to check if the video was actually taken during the claimed time and if Manoj Tiwari's visit was indeed related to the BJP's condition in Haryana elections.
3. **Political Situation**: The claim suggests a correlation between the visit and the BJP's condition in the elections, which would need to be backed by evidence showing a direct link.

Without specific evidence or further context, the claim cannot be fully verified. Therefore, it is prudent to categorize it as 'Half True' until more information becomes available.

"The people of Brazil implemented PM Modi's appeal for ""spreading light"".",mostly false,hi,"To assess the claim that ""The people of Brazil implemented PM Modi's appeal for 'spreading light',"" we need to consider the following points:

1. **Context of the Appeal**: PM Modi's appeal for ""spreading light"" typically refers to his call for Indians to light lamps or candles in a show of solidarity and hope, often during specific events or crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. **Global Reach**: While PM Modi's appeals can have a significant impact within India, their direct influence outside India, such as in Brazil, is less certain.

3. **Verification**: There is no widely reported or documented evidence suggesting that the people of Brazil collectively implemented PM Modi's appeal for ""spreading light.""

Given these considerations, the claim that the people of Brazil implemented PM Modi's appeal for ""spreading light"" is likely exaggerated and not supported by widespread evidence.

However, as of my last update in October 2023, there has been no widely reported incident of six Indian soldiers being killed by a Chinese rocket in Sikkim. Such an event would likely receive significant international attention and coverage.

Dushyant Chautala has said to support BJP,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Dushyant Chautala has said to support BJP,"" we need to consider the context and available information.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Dushyant Chautala's Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) has been in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana.

However, without specific details on the exact statement or the context in which it was made, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. Generally, if Dushyant Chautala has publicly stated support for the BJP, the claim would be considered true or mostly true. If there is no clear statement or the context is unclear, it might be considered half true.

Given the available information and the general political context, the claim is likely to be true or mostly true.

Rahul Gandhi was born on June 19, 1970. If the nurse Rajamma was 13 years old at the time of Rahul Gandhi's birth, she would have been born around 1957.

However, without additional information about Rajamma's actual birth year, we cannot definitively confirm the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the statement.

However, based on the phrasing alone, it seems to suggest that a child is sleeping near or at the grave of their parents in Syria. Without additional information, such as a reliable source or specific incident, it is difficult to confirm whether this is a true event or a misinterpretation.

Number of patients can reach close to three crores by August 15 in the country,half true,hi,"To evaluate the claim that ""Number of patients can reach close to three crores by August 15 in the country,"" we need to consider the context and available data at the time of the claim.

As of my last update in October 2023, COVID-19 cases have varied significantly across different countries and time periods. Without specific data or a reference to a particular country and time frame, it is challenging to accurately assess the claim. However, we can use general knowledge and historical data to provide a reasonable evaluation.

Three crores (30 million) is a substantial number of cases. Historical data shows that even during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries with the highest caseloads did not reach 30 million cases within a short period. For example, India, one of the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, had reported around 3.4 million cases by August 15, 2020.

Given the historical context and the typical rate of infection spread, the claim that the number of patients could reach close to three crores by August 15 in any country seems highly exaggerated.

However, it's worth noting that National Geographic does occasionally pay substantial amounts for exclusive content, particularly if it is of significant scientific or historical value.

That said, claims of large sums paid for content often circulate without verification. Without verifiable sources confirming the $1 million payment for this specific video, the claim should be treated with skepticism.

Therefore, the claim is largely unsupported.",,False,True
A video of the world's largest Motora stadium ... a video has been viral with captions.,half true,gu,"To determine the veracity of the claim that a video of the world's largest Motora stadium has gone viral, we need to break down the statement and verify the key points:

1. **Existence of the World's Largest Motora Stadium**: There needs to be a recognized stadium that is indeed the largest of its kind.
2. **Viral Video**: There should be evidence of a video featuring this stadium that has gained significant online attention.

Without specific details or context, it's challenging to verify the claim entirely. However, based on general knowledge and the lack of specific information about a ""Motora stadium,"" it's likely that there is no widely recognized stadium by that name. Additionally, without evidence of a viral video, the claim becomes even more dubious.

While it is true that sharing copyrighted material without permission can be illegal, the claim that any PDF file of a newspaper on WhatsApp groups will be illegal and action can be taken is an overgeneralization. There are exceptions, such as fair use, and the legality can depend on various factors including the country's copyright laws, the specific use case, and whether permission has been granted. Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate.",,False,True
The government has decided to run a special train called 'Jan Sadar' to send thousands of workers trapped in South India back home.,half true,hi,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider whether the government has indeed announced or implemented a special train called 'Jan Sadar' for the purpose mentioned. As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have real-time information or specific details about a train called 'Jan Sadar.' However, it is known that the Indian government has run special trains called 'Shramik Special' trains during the COVID-19 pandemic to transport migrant workers back to their home states.

Given the lack of specific information about 'Jan Sadar,' the claim is likely inaccurate or misleading.

Pictures of oppression of Muslims in India.,mostly false,bn,"To accurately assess the claim ""Pictures of oppression of Muslims in India,"" we need to consider a few factors:

1. **Context**: India is a diverse country with a significant Muslim population. There have been instances of communal tension and violence, but it's crucial to note that these are not representative of the entire country's dynamics.

2. **Evidence**: While there may be specific incidents and images that depict oppression, these do not represent the everyday experience of all Muslims in India. The country has a complex social fabric with varying levels of integration and conflict.

3. **Generalization**: The claim implies a widespread and consistent oppression, which is not accurate. There are indeed challenges and instances of discrimination, but the situation is not uniformly oppressive.

Given these points, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true. It oversimplifies a complex reality.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"If there is a problem during the vote, people can contact CRPF directly at 03812341064 and 122022.",false,bn,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify the contact numbers provided for the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Without direct access to current CRPF contact information, I'll provide a general guideline based on typical verification methods:

1. **Check Official Websites**: The official CRPF website or government portals often list contact numbers for public use.
2. **Cross-Reference with Trusted Sources**: News articles, government announcements, or reliable media outlets may confirm these numbers.
3. **Public Announcements**: During elections, official public service announcements may include contact details for authorities.

Given that I can't directly verify these numbers in real-time, I'll assume a cautious approach based on typical scenarios:

- If the numbers are listed on the official CRPF website or a trusted government source, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the numbers are partially correct (e.g., one number is correct but the other is not), the claim would be 'Half True'.
- If the numbers are not listed on any official sources or are outdated, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the numbers have been cross-verified with official sources and are correct.

The house of Dalit Hindus has been burned in Tellenipara in Hooghly in West Bengal,mostly false,bn,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we would need to rely on credible news sources, official statements, or investigative reports. As of my last update in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to current events or specific news reports. However, I can guide you on how to assess the claim:

1. **Check Local News Outlets**: Look for reports from local newspapers, TV channels, or online news portals in West Bengal.
2. **Official Statements**: Check for statements from local authorities, police, or government officials.
3. **Fact-Checking Websites**: Websites like Alt News, Boom Live, or India Today's fact-checking section can provide verified information.
4. **Social Media**: Sometimes, eyewitness accounts or local activists may share information, but be cautious as social media can also spread misinformation.

If there is no credible source confirming the incident, the claim might be considered 'Mostly False' or 'False'. If there are conflicting reports or partial evidence, it might be considered 'Half True' or 'Mostly True'.

**Final Answer**: Without specific evidence, it is difficult to categorize the claim accurately. For an accurate assessment, please refer to the most recent and reliable sources.",,False,True
"Amitabh Bachchan supported Jamia's students, protested against the behavior of Delhi police",mostly false,bn,"To determine the veracity of the claim that ""Amitabh Bachchan supported Jamia's students, protested against the behavior of Delhi police,"" we need to look for credible sources that confirm Amitabh Bachchan's statements or actions regarding this issue.

Amitabh Bachchan is a prominent figure in India, and any public stance he takes on political or social issues would likely be widely reported by mainstream media. If he had explicitly supported Jamia's students or protested against the Delhi police, there would be substantial evidence in news articles, interviews, or social media posts.

As of my last update in October 2023, there is no widely reported or confirmed information that Amitabh Bachchan made such statements or actions. Public figures often make their views known through public statements, social media, or interviews, and the absence of such evidence suggests that the claim might be unfounded.

Mamata Banerjee's goons in Kolkata attacked Hindus during BJP rally,false,hi,"To evaluate the claim ""Mamata Banerjee's goons in Kolkata attacked Hindus during BJP rally,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Who made the claim and what is their credibility?
2. **Evidence**: Are there credible reports, eyewitness accounts, or official statements supporting the claim?
3. **Context**: What was the political and social context surrounding the alleged incident?
4. **Counter-Evidence**: Are there any counter-claims or denials from other credible sources?

Without specific, verifiable evidence such as credible news reports, eyewitness accounts, or official investigations, it is difficult to substantiate the claim. Political accusations often involve bias and can be used to sway public opinion without concrete evidence.

Given the lack of specific, verifiable information in the prompt, the claim cannot be definitively proven as true. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim is likely exaggerated or unfounded.

BJP leaders insulted the national anthem and flag hoisting.There was no flag hoisting at the RSS office in Nagpur.,half true,hi,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Specific Incidents**: The claim suggests that BJP leaders insulted the national anthem and flag hoisting. Without specific examples or evidence, it is difficult to verify this part of the claim.

2. **Flag Hoisting at RSS Office**: The claim states that there was no flag hoisting at the RSS office in Nagpur. This part of the claim also requires specific evidence to be verified.

3. **General Practices**: It is well-known that the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) are organizations that generally uphold nationalistic values and symbols, including the national anthem and flag. Therefore, a broad claim of insulting these symbols would need strong evidence to be substantiated.

Without specific, verifiable instances or evidence, the claim appears to be a generalized and unsupported allegation. Therefore, based on the information available and the need for evidence to support such claims, the claim is likely:

**Final Answer: Mostly False**",mostly false,False,False

Without specific details or evidence, it is impossible to confirm whether the woman inspector is indeed posted in the same area where her father drives a rickshaw.

Given the lack of verifiable information, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false. It falls into a category where more information is needed for a precise determination.

"The government ignored the demand to postpone the JEE-Neet exam, due to which this girl committed suicide.",mostly false,hi,"Without specific details about the case, it's difficult to accurately assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, it's important to note that attributing a suicide solely to one event, such as the government's decision not to postpone exams, is often an oversimplification. Suicide is typically the result of a complex interplay of various factors.

Given the seriousness and sensitivity of the topic, it's crucial to rely on official investigations and reports. If there is no concrete evidence or official statement linking the suicide directly and solely to the government's decision, the claim would be an oversimplification of a complex issue.

1. The existence of a drone scientist named Pratap NM.
2. Whether Pratap NM received a job proposal from France.
3. Whether Prime Minister Modi appointed Pratap NM to the DRDO organization.
4. Whether the DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) has made any official announcements regarding this appointment.

Without access to specific, up-to-date information or official announcements, I cannot confirm the accuracy of this claim. Therefore, the best course of action would be to check reliable news sources or official statements from the DRDO or the Indian government.

"By filling a form on the webelink, anyone can get a free mask to fight the coronavirus.",false,hi,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the feasibility and typical practices of such offers. Generally, free offers for essential items like masks during a pandemic would come from reputable organizations, government agencies, or well-known charities. If the claim comes from an unknown source or lacks credible backing, it is likely to be misleading.

Without specific details about the legitimacy of the 'webelink' or the organization behind it, it is difficult to verify the claim as entirely true. However, it is plausible that some organizations or initiatives might offer free masks, but these would typically be well-publicized and come from trusted sources.

Given the lack of specific information and the general skepticism warranted by such claims, the most accurate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Whale appeared in Bombay High after lockdown,false,hi,"The claim 'Whale appeared in Bombay High after lockdown' is not specific enough to verify without additional context, such as the date or specific details of the sighting. However, it is known that marine life, including whales, has been spotted in areas with reduced human activity due to lockdowns imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bombay High is an offshore oil field, and while it is plausible that marine life could appear in such areas due to reduced human activity, a specific sighting would need to be corroborated by reliable sources or reports.

Without specific evidence or reports to support the claim, it is difficult to definitively classify it as completely true or false. Therefore, the claim can be considered 'Half True' based on the general trend of marine life appearing in areas with reduced human activity during lockdowns.

The phrase ""turned off after healing"" is unclear and does not make sense in the context of discussing a virus or a patient. It seems to be a misinterpretation or a misunderstanding of medical terminology.

Given the lack of clarity and the nonsensical nature of the claim, the statement cannot be verified as true. Therefore, the claim is false.

Without additional information, such as the source of the photos, their authenticity, and the context in which they are presented, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, if we assume that the claim is accompanied by actual photographs that accurately depict conditions or activities at an Assam detention center, and these photos have been verified by credible sources, then the claim could be considered true.

Conversely, if the photos are misrepresented, manipulated, or from a different location or context, the claim would be false.

Without additional context and verification, a general assessment would be:

Shiv Sena spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut's video of the wedding dance viral,false,mr,"To accurately determine the validity of the claim that ""Shiv Sena spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut's video of the wedding dance viral,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. **Existence of the Video**: Confirm whether a video exists that shows Sanjay Raut dancing at a wedding.
2. **Viral Nature**: Determine if the video has indeed gone viral, which typically means it has been widely shared and viewed on social media platforms.

Without access to real-time internet searches or specific data on the video's spread, I can't confirm the existence or virality of the video. However, if such a video exists and has been widely shared, the claim could be considered true or mostly true. If the video doesn't exist or hasn't gained significant attention, the claim would be false or mostly false.

Given the lack of specific information, a cautious approach would be to classify the claim as ""Half True"" until further verification is possible.

According to official reports, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the clash, not just one as the claim suggests. Additionally, the exact number of Chinese casualties has not been officially confirmed, but various reports suggest it was more than two.

Given these discrepancies in the numbers, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Without specific evidence or verified sources, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the provided statement alone, here's an analysis:

1. **Evidence**: The claim mentions a viral picture, but it doesn't provide the picture itself or any verification of its contents.
2. **Context**: The claim suggests that the distribution was done before the BJP's elections, but it doesn't specify which elections or provide any contextual details.
3. **Source**: The claim doesn't mention any credible sources or witnesses to corroborate the distribution.

Given the lack of concrete evidence and context, the claim cannot be fully substantiated. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Corona vaccine in a medical university in Russia has been successful in all kinds of tests,half true,bn,"To evaluate the claim accurately, it's important to consider the context and available evidence. As of my last update in October 2023, there have been multiple claims about the success of various COVID-19 vaccines, including those developed in Russia, such as Sputnik V.

The claim that a Corona vaccine developed at a medical university in Russia has been successful in all kinds of tests is broad and could be interpreted in different ways. Success in ""all kinds of tests"" could refer to preclinical trials, clinical trials, or regulatory approvals.

Sputnik V, developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, has undergone various stages of testing and has received approval in several countries. However, the claim of success in ""all kinds of tests"" is somewhat ambiguous and could be misleading without specific details.

Given the available information, the claim is likely overstated or lacking necessary specificity. Therefore, a reasonable assessment would be:

These huge crowds have been ralled by Rahul Gandhi in Jalore on Thursday.,half true,hi,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we would need to check reliable news sources, witness accounts, and photographic or video evidence from the event in Jalore on the specified date. Since I don't have real-time access to the internet or current events, I can't verify the claim directly.

However, I can guide you on how to assess the claim:

1. **Check News Reports**: Look for reports from reputable news outlets that cover the event in Jalore.
2. **Official Statements**: Check for any official statements from Rahul Gandhi's party or his official social media accounts.
3. **Eyewitness Accounts**: Look for accounts from people who attended the event.
4. **Photographic or Video Evidence**: Check for photos or videos that show the size of the crowds.

If the above sources confirm that Rahul Gandhi rallied huge crowds in Jalore on Thursday, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the sources provide mixed information or limited evidence, it might be 'Half True'. If the sources contradict the claim or provide evidence of smaller crowds, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

1. A video showing people flowing into the river due to a bridge collapse.
2. The location is described as Assam.

Without access to the actual video or additional context, it's challenging to verify the authenticity and specific details of the claim. However, based on the information provided, here's an analysis:

- The description suggests a significant event involving a bridge collapse and people being swept into a river.
- The claim specifies the location as Assam.

Given the lack of specific details and verification, the claim cannot be fully substantiated or refuted. Thus, it would be prudent to classify it as 'Half True' until further evidence is provided.

Without specific details or external verification, it's challenging to determine the exact truthfulness of the claim.

However, based on general principles of evaluating such claims:

1. **Source Credibility**: The source of the video should be a reputable news organization or official government agency.
2. **Authenticity**: The video should be verified by multiple credible sources.
3. **Context**: The context of the interrogation should match the events surrounding the Pulwama terror attack.

Given these considerations and without specific evidence, the claim could be considered 'Half True' as it might contain elements of truth but could also be misleading or lack full context.

"The more expenses the Statue of Unity has been made, in which China built a sea bridge.",half true,hi,"Final Answer: Mostly False.

The claim suggests that the Statue of Unity in India cost more than the sea bridge built by China. However, without specific figures and reliable sources to compare the exact costs, it's challenging to validate this claim accurately. Generally, large infrastructure projects like sea bridges can be significantly more expensive than standalone statues, but this can vary based on specific projects.

Hindu daughters-in-law are being tampered with in the Muslim dominated region.,half true,hi,"To evaluate the claim ""Hindu daughters-in-law are being tampered with in the Muslim dominated region,"" it is essential to consider several factors:

1. **Specificity**: The claim is vague and lacks specific details such as the location, the nature of the ""tampering,"" and the source of the information.
2. **Evidence**: Without concrete evidence, such as official reports, statistical data, or credible news sources, it is difficult to verify the claim.
3. **Context**: The claim could be interpreted in various ways, including but not limited to cultural, social, or religious contexts, which makes it even more challenging to assess without further details.

Here's why: The claim suggests that Muslims have never organized Navratri Puja in a mosque, implying a lack of reciprocity in religious tolerance. However, the statement does not provide any evidence or sources to support this claim, and it disregards numerous instances of interfaith events and mutual respect between different religious communities in India. Moreover, the organization of religious events in places of worship of other religions is not a common practice for either community, making the comparison misleading.

The claim that ""Indian soldiers raped the Naga woman in Kohima"" lacks specific context, dates, and detailed evidence to substantiate it. Without concrete evidence or references to well-documented incidents, it is difficult to validate such a claim.

Historically, there have been allegations of human rights abuses by security forces in various regions, including the Naga areas, but these allegations need to be backed by thorough investigations and reports from reliable sources.

"The youth is committing suicide with unemployment, but regardless of this, PM Modi is celebrating his birthday with industrialists.",mostly false,hi,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components:

1. ""The youth is committing suicide with unemployment"": This is a serious allegation that would require specific data to support. While youth unemployment can be a contributing factor to mental health issues, attributing suicides directly to unemployment without data is speculative.

2. ""PM Modi is celebrating his birthday with industrialists"": This part of the claim would need to be verified with specific evidence. Celebrating a birthday with industrialists is not inherently negative, but the context and implications would depend on the details of the event.

Without specific, verifiable data or evidence supporting both parts of the claim, it is difficult to assert that the statement is entirely accurate. Therefore, the claim appears to be a mix of unverified assertions and speculation.

These incidents have been documented by various news outlets and official sources from both countries.

While the intensity and frequency of these clashes can vary, the fact that such incidents have occurred is well-established. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but may not be entirely true in every context or at every point in time.

A picture of Babri Masjid where Muslims are offering prayers for the last time.,false,hi,"To accurately assess the claim, it is important to consider historical context and available evidence. The Babri Masjid was a mosque in Ayodhya, India, that was demolished in 1992. There were indeed instances of Muslims offering prayers at the Babri Masjid before its demolition.

1. **Swapna Suresh is one of the most accused in the case of smuggling in Kerala**: This is a widely reported and documented fact. Swapna Suresh has been named in the gold smuggling case in Kerala.

2. **Swapna Suresh is a Muslim**: There is no reliable evidence to suggest that Swapna Suresh is a Muslim. Her publicly known identity does not indicate a change of religion or a Muslim background.

3. **His real name is Mumtaz Ismail**: There is no credible source to support the claim that Swapna Suresh's real name is Mumtaz Ismail. This appears to be a baseless rumor.

A picture of Delhi Police while kicking a Muslim youth.,half true,hi,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider several factors: the source of the image, the context in which it was taken, and any corroborating evidence from reputable sources. Without access to specific image verification tools or contextual information, it's challenging to determine the absolute truth of the claim.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the image is from a credible source and if there are other reputable news outlets reporting the same incident.
2. **Contextual Evidence**: Look for eyewitness accounts, official statements from Delhi Police, or other corroborating evidence.
3. **Image Analysis**: Examine the image for signs of manipulation or misrepresentation.

Without these details, it's impossible to conclusively determine the veracity of the claim. Therefore, based on the information available and the need for further verification, the claim would likely be considered 'Half True' until more evidence is provided.
