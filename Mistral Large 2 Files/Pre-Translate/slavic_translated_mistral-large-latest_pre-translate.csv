"""As for the tram, they could not pass because of the gathered citizens, and the traffic was normalized after the end of the protest.""",false,sr,"To assess the claim, we need to consider the context and the details provided. The claim states that trams could not pass due to gathered citizens and that traffic normalized after the protest ended. Without additional context or verification from other sources, we can only evaluate the claim based on the information given.

If the statement accurately reflects the events as described, with trams being unable to pass due to gathered citizens and traffic normalizing after the protest, then the claim would be considered true or mostly true. However, without independent verification or additional details, it's challenging to determine the absolute truthfulness of the claim.

"The median size of the average salary in January was 112 thousand tenge.And the modal, that is, the most common salary, is 58 thousand tenge.",true,ru,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the definitions of median and mode in the context of salaries:

- The **median** is the middle value when all salaries are arranged in ascending order. It represents the salary level at which 50% of the population earns less and 50% earns more.
- The **mode** is the most frequently occurring salary. It is the salary that appears most often in the dataset.

Given the statement ""The median size of the average salary in January was 112 thousand tenge. And the modal, that is, the most common salary, is 58 thousand tenge,"" we need to determine if these two figures can logically coexist.

It is possible for the median and mode to differ significantly, especially in datasets with a skewed distribution. For example, if many people earn around 58 thousand tenge (making it the mode), but there are also enough higher salaries to push the median up to 112 thousand tenge, this scenario is plausible.

Therefore, the claim can be true under certain conditions where the salary distribution allows for such a difference between the median and the mode.

"""The Democratic Party filled everything that promised four years ago.""",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim that ""The Democratic Party filled everything that promised four years ago,"" we need to consider the party's platform and the extent to which its promises have been fulfilled. This involves looking at a range of policy areas such as healthcare, climate change, economic policies, social justice, and more.

Given the complexity and scope of political promises, it is rare for any party to fully deliver on all its promises within a four-year period. Typically, there are partial successes, compromises, and setbacks. Therefore, while the Democratic Party may have made progress on some of its promises, it is unlikely that every single promise has been completely fulfilled.

Based on this reasoning, the claim is likely an overstatement.

Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a widely used medication for pain and fever relief. While it is possible to overdose on paracetamol, leading to severe liver damage and even death, this typically occurs over a longer period or with a very high single dose, not strictly on the sixth day of admission as stated. Additionally, the claim lacks specificity about the dosage and circumstances leading to death, making it an unverifiable and likely false statement.

"""Negotiations with the Ministry of Education are already giving results and is a step of the opening of the Faculty of the Godology.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the information provided and the context. The claim states that negotiations with the Ministry of Education are yielding results and that this is a step toward opening the Faculty of Godology. However, without specific details or evidence to support the progress of these negotiations or the likelihood of opening such a faculty, it is difficult to verify the claim as entirely true.

Given the lack of concrete evidence or supporting details, the claim could be considered somewhat speculative. Therefore, a reasonable assessment would be that the claim is 'Half True', as it acknowledges ongoing negotiations but does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm the actual results or the imminent opening of the Faculty of Godology.

However, based on the wording alone, the claim suggests a tentative positive change in employment numbers but acknowledges uncertainty about whether it indicates a new trend.

Given the cautious language (""slight increase,"" ""will only be seen whether it will mean the beginning of the new trend""), the claim appears to be carefully presenting an observation without overstating its significance.

"""Homemade milk is regularly controlled and is completely right.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim ""Homemade milk is regularly controlled and is completely right,"" we need to consider two aspects: the regulation of homemade milk and its safety or correctness.

1. **Regulation**: Homemade milk is not typically subject to the same rigorous controls and regulations as commercially produced milk. Homemade milk production does not usually involve formal inspections or quality control measures.

2. **Safety**: While homemade milk can be safe if produced under hygienic conditions, it is not guaranteed to be ""completely right"" without proper testing and controls. The risk of contamination and other safety issues is higher compared to commercially produced milk.

Given these points, the claim that ""homemade milk is regularly controlled and is completely right"" is not accurate.

""",mostly true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components:

1. **Allocations for science in Serbia are 1% of GDP, lower than the EU average of about 2% of GDP in 2013.**
2. **From the private sector, only 7.5% of all investments in science in Serbia, which is significantly below the EU average where as many as 55% of all investments in science make private sector investments.**

Let's examine each part:

### Part 1: Allocations for Science in Serbia vs. EU Average
- **Claim**: Allocations for science in Serbia are 1% of GDP, lower than the EU average of about 2% of GDP in 2013.
- **Analysis**: According to available data, Serbia's expenditure on research and development (R&D) has historically been lower than the EU average. The EU average for R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP was indeed around 2% in 2013. Serbia's figure of 1% is plausible given its lower economic development compared to many EU countries.

### Part 2: Private Sector Investment in Science in Serbia vs. EU Average
- **Claim**: From the private sector, only 7.5% of all investments in science in Serbia, which is significantly below the EU average where as many as 55% of all investments in science make private sector investments.
- **Analysis**: The EU average for private sector investment in R&D is typically around 55-60%. Serbia's private sector contribution to R&D is indeed much lower, often cited as less than 10%. The figure of 7.5% is within the range of plausible values for Serbia.

1. **Poland pays 2% GDP for defense**: According to NATO data, Poland has been meeting the 2% GDP defense spending target since 2015. This part of the claim is true.

2. **Poland has announced it will soon be 2.5%**: Poland has indeed announced plans to increase its defense spending to 2.5% of GDP. This was reported in various news outlets and confirmed by Polish government officials.

Given that both parts of the claim are accurate, the overall statement can be considered true.

"In Kazakhstan, from 20 to 40 tons of various narcotic substances is seized annually.",true,ru,"To evaluate the claim that ""In Kazakhstan, from 20 to 40 tons of various narcotic substances is seized annually,"" we need to consider available data and reports from credible sources.

As of my last update in October 2023, specific annual figures on narcotics seizures in Kazakhstan are not readily available in public databases or reports. However, general trends and reports from international organizations and national law enforcement agencies can provide some context.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and other international organizations regularly publish reports on drug trafficking and seizures. While exact figures for Kazakhstan might not be prominently featured, the general trend in Central Asia and neighboring regions can give us an idea.

Given the lack of precise data, we can infer that the claim might be partially true based on regional trends and general reports on drug seizures. However, without specific annual figures, it is challenging to confirm the exact range of 20 to 40 tons.

More than 4.5 million citizens left without temporary income received assistance in the amount of 42 thousand 500 tenge.More than 450 billion tenge was spent on this,true,ru,"To evaluate the claim, let's perform a simple calculation:

The claim states that more than 4.5 million citizens received assistance of 42,500 tenge each, and more than 450 billion tenge was spent on this.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent if exactly 4.5 million citizens received 42,500 tenge each:

\( 4,500,000 \text{ citizens} \times 42,500 \text{ tenge/citizen} = 191,250,000,000 \text{ tenge} \)

This calculation shows that 191.25 billion tenge would be needed to provide 42,500 tenge to 4.5 million citizens.

The claim states that more than 450 billion tenge was spent, which is significantly higher than the calculated amount of 191.25 billion tenge.

Given this discrepancy, the claim appears to be inaccurate in terms of the total amount spent.

1. **Perception of Bottled Water as Fashionable**: There is some truth to the idea that bottled water has become a fashion trend, with many people associating it with a healthy lifestyle and convenience.

2. **Quality of Czech Tap Water**: Czech tap water is generally considered to be of high quality. Many countries, including the Czech Republic, have stringent regulations to ensure the safety and quality of tap water.

3. **Consumer Behavior**: While some consumers may prefer bottled water for reasons such as taste, convenience, or perceived health benefits, it's not accurate to say that the majority do not believe in the quality of Czech tap water. Many people still rely on tap water for their daily needs.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also some exaggeration. Therefore, the most accurate assessment is:

   - They help prevent certain types of cyber attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **Misleading or incorrect aspects**:
   - The term ""Internet meshs"" is not a recognized term in cybersecurity. The correct term might be ""mesh networks,"" but these are not typically associated with the primary threats that security certificates address.
   - ""Cyberism"" is not a standard term in cybersecurity. The correct term might be ""cybercrime"" or ""cyber threats.""

To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Reduction in Space Requirements**: The claim mentions specific reductions in space requirements for children in nurseries and part-time facilities. This part of the claim is presented as a factual change in regulations.

2. **Comparison to Prisoner Space**: The claim compares the reduced space requirements for children to the space allocated for prisoners, which is stated to be 3 m². This part of the claim is presented as a comparison to highlight the disparity in space allocation.

Without external verification, we can only evaluate the claim based on the information provided. The claim presents specific numbers and a comparison, which suggests that it is grounded in factual information. However, without independent verification or context, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the comparison to prisoner space.

Given the specificity of the numbers and the context provided, it is reasonable to consider the claim as mostly accurate, but with the caveat that the comparison to prisoner space may require further verification.

To evaluate this claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Reduced Customs Duties**: If customs duties have indeed been reduced, this can lower the cost of importing goods, potentially making them cheaper for consumers.

2. **Product Categories**: The claim mentions specific product categories (computers, technical goods, furniture, textiles), which are common items that could be affected by changes in customs duties.

3. **Market Dynamics**: Other factors such as transportation costs, exchange rates, and market competition also influence the final price of goods. Reduced customs duties alone do not guarantee that products will be cheaper.

4. **Evidence**: Without specific data or evidence to support the claim that these products are indeed cheaper due to reduced customs duties, it is difficult to fully validate the statement.

Given these considerations, the claim that products are cheaper due to reduced customs duties is plausible but not definitively proven without additional evidence. Therefore, the claim is likely partially accurate but not fully substantiated.

1. **The Washington Post List**: The Washington Post has indeed published lists and trackers of Covid-19 vaccines in development. These lists often include a wide range of vaccines from different countries and stages of development.

2. **Kazakhstan's Vaccine**: Kazakhstan has been developing its own Covid-19 vaccine, known as QazVac (or QazCovid-in). It has undergone various stages of clinical trials.

3. **Inclusion in the List**: Whether QazVac is specifically included in the Washington Post's list of promising vaccines would require checking the exact list mentioned. However, it is plausible that a comprehensive list would include vaccines from various countries, including Kazakhstan.

Given these points, without direct verification from the specific list, it is reasonable to consider the claim as potentially accurate but not definitively proven. Therefore, the claim can be considered 'Mostly True' based on the available information.

"In general, the state budget deficit is decreasing, this is the lowest deficit in recent years.During the PO-PSL rule, in 2010/11 he reached 100 billion.PLN, at the moment we have 28.5 billion.",half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the stated figures and trends regarding the state budget deficit in Poland.

1. **Claim Analysis**:
   - The claim suggests that the state budget deficit has been decreasing and is currently at its lowest in recent years.
   - It mentions specific figures: a deficit of 100 billion PLN during the PO-PSL rule in 2010/11 and a current deficit of 28.5 billion PLN.

2. **Verification Steps**:
   - Check historical data on the Polish state budget deficit.
   - Verify the deficit figures for the years mentioned (2010/11 and the current year).
   - Assess the trend to confirm if the deficit has indeed been decreasing.

3. **Historical Data Check**:
   - According to available data, the Polish state budget deficit in 2010 was indeed high, although the exact figure might need confirmation from official sources like the Polish Ministry of Finance or statistical agencies.
   - For the current year, the deficit figure of 28.5 billion PLN should be cross-verified with the latest reports from reliable sources.

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   - If the data shows a decreasing trend in the deficit over the years, and the current deficit is significantly lower than in 2010/11, the claim about the deficit being the lowest in recent years would be supported.

Based on the information typically available, the claim about the deficit decreasing and being at its lowest in recent years is generally accurate, assuming the figures are correct. However, without specific verification of the exact figures, we can conclude that the trend described is mostly accurate.

1. The speaker has not been invited to a public television interview for the last 5 years.
2. Grzegorz Schetyna was not invited to public television for a one-on-one interview for one year.

Without specific knowledge of the television scheduling and invitations for these individuals, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, if we assume the statement is made in good faith and reflects the speaker's knowledge, we can consider it as follows:

- Part 1: If the speaker has not been invited for the last 5 years, this could be true based on their personal experience.
- Part 2: If Grzegorz Schetyna was not invited for a one-on-one interview for one year, this could also be true based on the available information.

The European Charter of Local Self-Government, often referred to as the European Local Government Card, does indeed state that changes to the boundaries of local communities should be carried out by a referendum. This is a principle aimed at ensuring local autonomy and democratic participation in decision-making processes.

Given this context, the claim that a solution involving a change in the voivodship border without a referendum is incompatible with the European Local Government Card is accurate. The Charter emphasizes the importance of referendums for such changes to respect the will of the local community.

The salary in the national economy has increased in the last 2.5 years by 20%. It is an increase that has not been recorded earlier.,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim that ""The salary in the national economy has increased in the last 2.5 years by 20%. It is an increase that has not been recorded earlier,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Actual Data**: We need to verify if the salary in the national economy has indeed increased by 20% over the last 2.5 years.
2. **Historical Context**: We need to check if this level of increase is unprecedented.

Without access to specific data or historical records, it's challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, we can make a general assessment based on typical economic trends.

- **Increase of 20%**: While a 20% increase in salaries over 2.5 years is significant, it is not unheard of, especially during periods of strong economic growth or inflation.
- **Historical Context**: Claiming that such an increase has never been recorded before is a bold statement that requires robust historical data to support or refute.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, a balanced approach would be to consider it partially true, acknowledging that while the increase might be substantial, the claim of it being unprecedented needs further verification.

1. **Emigration during PiS rule**: The claim states that the largest number of Poles emigrated during PiS rule, with approximately 0.5 million per year.
2. **Current emigration numbers**: The claim states that currently, the number is around 50-60 thousand per year, which is 8 times less than during the PiS rule.

Without specific data, it's challenging to verify the exact numbers. However, we can analyze the general trends and available statistics.

- According to various sources, including the Polish Central Statistical Office (GUS), emigration from Poland has indeed fluctuated over the years.
- The peak periods of emigration often correlate with economic and political factors.
- Recent data suggests that emigration numbers have been decreasing, but the exact figures and the extent of the decrease can vary.

Given the lack of precise data in the claim and the general trends observed, it's reasonable to conclude that while there might have been a significant number of emigrants during the PiS rule, the exact figures and the extent of the reduction are not clearly substantiated.

The World Financial Crisis, also known as the Great Recession, began in 2007 and had a significant global impact by 2008. Serbia, like many other countries, was affected by the crisis. The statement suggests that the citizens of Serbia in 2009 acknowledged the impending difficulty, which aligns with the broader economic downturn experienced globally.

However, the phrase ""said that it would be the most difficult in our newer history"" is somewhat ambiguous and subjective. It is challenging to definitively verify the collective sentiment of an entire population without specific data or surveys. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the financial crisis was indeed a challenging period for Serbia.

Given the context and the general understanding of the global financial crisis's impact, the claim can be considered mostly accurate, although it lacks specific verifiable details.

"""Italy, after Germany, the second foreign trade partner of Serbia, but the first export destination for our companies.""",true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the latest available data on Serbia's foreign trade. According to various economic reports and data from sources such as the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia and international trade databases:

1. **Germany is the largest foreign trade partner of Serbia**, which is consistent with the claim.
2. **Italy is indeed a significant trade partner**, often ranking as one of the top three export destinations for Serbian products.

However, the specific ranking of Italy as the first export destination can vary depending on the year and specific economic factors. Without the most recent and precise data, it is challenging to definitively confirm Italy's exact rank.

Given the general consistency of Germany being the top trade partner and Italy being a significant export destination, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but not definitively true without the latest data.

"Today, thanks to the signature made by the President on the Act, the minimum hourly rate is PLN 17, not PLN 5, as it was 5 years ago.",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:
1. The current minimum hourly rate in Poland is PLN 17.
2. The minimum hourly rate 5 years ago was PLN 5.

Let's break down these points:

1. **Current Minimum Hourly Rate**: As of my last update in October 2023, we need to check the most recent data on the minimum wage in Poland. If the current minimum hourly rate is indeed PLN 17, this part of the claim is true.

2. **Minimum Hourly Rate 5 Years Ago**: We need to look at historical data from 5 years ago (around 2018). If the minimum hourly rate was PLN 5 at that time, this part of the claim is true.

Without specific data on the minimum wage rates for those years, we can't definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim. However, based on general trends in minimum wage increases over time, a jump from PLN 5 to PLN 17 in 5 years seems quite significant and might be an exaggeration.

Given the lack of specific data, we can only speculate that the claim might be partially accurate but likely exaggerated. Therefore, a reasonable assessment would be:

2. **Data Verification**: According to recent data from the Polish Central Statistical Office (GUS), the public sector in Poland employs a significant number of people. As of 2021, the total number of public sector employees, including those in education, healthcare, and other public services, is indeed over 400,000.

"Even at the official price growth rate, only 7 months of households incur additional costs for products of 225 billion tenge",mostly true,ru,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider several factors: the official price growth rate, the time period (7 months), the number of households, and the calculation of additional costs amounting to 225 billion tenge. Without specific data on these variables, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim's accuracy. However, we can analyze the plausibility.

1. **Official Price Growth Rate**: This refers to the rate of inflation or increase in the prices of goods and services.
2. **Time Period (7 months)**: This suggests that the impact is measured over 7 months.
3. **Number of Households**: The claim doesn't specify the number of households, which is crucial for calculating the total additional costs.
4. **Additional Costs (225 billion tenge)**: This is the total extra expense incurred by households due to price increases.

Given the lack of specific data on the official price growth rate, the number of households, and the method of calculating the additional costs, we can't verify the claim with certainty. However, if the claim is based on accurate official data and proper calculations, it could be plausible.

"""Serbia could become a 'European force' in the field of fisheries and fish processing by importing fish from the northern seas, and then reworked to sell Europeans.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim that ""Serbia could become a 'European force' in the field of fisheries and fish processing by importing fish from the northern seas, and then reworked to sell Europeans,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Geographical and Logistical Feasibility**: Serbia is a landlocked country, which means it does not have direct access to the sea. Importing fish from the northern seas would involve significant logistical challenges and costs.

2. **Infrastructure and Capacity**: Serbia would need substantial infrastructure for importing, processing, and exporting fish. This includes cold storage facilities, processing plants, and efficient transportation networks.

3. **Market Competition**: The European fish market is highly competitive, with established players who have direct access to fisheries and well-developed supply chains.

4. **Economic Viability**: The costs associated with importing, processing, and re-exporting fish could make the final product less competitive in the European market.

Given these factors, while it is theoretically possible for Serbia to engage in such activities, the claim that it could become a ""European force"" in this field seems overly optimistic. The significant hurdles and existing competition make this a challenging proposition.

"""All key economic indicators show a tendency to recover from March (2009), which means that the worst period is behind us.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim that ""All key economic indicators show a tendency to recover from March (2009), which means that the worst period is behind us,"" we need to consider the context and data from that time period.

In March 2009, the global economy was in the midst of the Great Recession, which was marked by significant economic downturns. Key economic indicators typically used to assess recovery include GDP growth, unemployment rates, stock market performance, and consumer confidence, among others.

Historically, by late 2009 and early 2010, many economies did begin to show signs of recovery. For example, GDP growth started to turn positive, unemployment rates began to stabilize or decrease, and stock markets started to rally. However, the recovery was not uniform across all indicators or regions, and some sectors continued to struggle.

Given this context, the claim that ""the worst period is behind us"" from March 2009 is generally aligned with the observed trends, although not all indicators would have shown uniform recovery by that specific point in time. Therefore, the claim is mostly accurate but not entirely true for all indicators at all times.

Without official data to verify the exact figures, we can analyze the general trend and plausibility.

The Gini coefficient is a measure of income or wealth inequality, with values ranging from 0 (perfect equality) to 100 (perfect inequality). A decrease from 31 to 29 would indicate a slight improvement in inequality.

Given the common fluctuations in economic indicators and the fact that such claims are often based on approximate figures, a decrease from 31 to 29 is plausible but would need to be verified with official statistics.

1. **PISA Results**: The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that evaluates education systems by testing the scholastic performance of 15-year-old students in mathematics, science, and reading.

2. **Literacy Trends**: The claim suggests that literacy (reading performance) is decreasing among schoolchildren in the context of PISA results.

3. **OECD Countries**: The claim also mentions that in OECD countries, children are constantly improving their reading literacy results.

Let's examine the available data:

- PISA reports from recent years have shown a mixed trend in reading literacy across different countries. While some OECD countries have shown improvements, others have seen stagnation or even decline.
- The overall trend is not uniformly positive or negative across all OECD countries.

Given these points, the claim that there is a constant increase in reading literacy results across all OECD countries is not entirely accurate. Similarly, the claim that there is a certain tendency to deterioration in literacy is also not universally true for all countries.

1. **Government Forecast Accuracy**: The claim states that government forecasts were accurate. Without specific data on the forecasts, we cannot verify the accuracy of this part of the claim.

2. **Agricultural Surplus**: The claim mentions a surplus of $320 million in the first six months, which is more than half of the total annual surplus of $600 million from the previous year. This suggests a positive trend, but without context on typical seasonal variations or other factors, it's hard to fully assess the significance.

This part of the claim needs to be verified with evidence of LSNS openly referring to Tiso's regime.

2. **""calls for violence""**: This part of the claim suggests that the LSNS explicitly advocates for violence. This needs to be supported by statements or actions from the LSNS that clearly call for violence.

3. **""organizes militias""**: This implies that the LSNS actively organizes armed groups or paramilitary units. Evidence of such activities would be necessary to validate this part of the claim.

4. **""Fascists got 8% of the votes""**: This is a quantitative claim about the electoral performance of the LSNS. This can be verified by checking election results.

1. **Number of Doctors in Poland**: The claim states there are approximately 149,000 doctors in Poland. This number needs to be verified against reliable sources.

2. **European Average**: The claim also states that this number is around the European average. This requires comparing Poland's doctor-to-population ratio with the average ratio in Europe.

Without specific data, it's challenging to confirm the exact numbers. However, based on general knowledge and available data from sources like the World Health Organization (WHO) and Eurostat, we can make an educated assessment.

- According to recent data, Poland has around 240 physicians per 100,000 population, which is slightly below the European Union average but not significantly so.
- The total number of doctors in Poland, based on population size, would indeed be in the range mentioned if we consider the doctor-to-population ratio.

Without specific context or additional information, it's challenging to verify the exact number of signatures collected or the actions taken with those signatures in the Sejm. However, we can analyze the plausibility and language used in the claim.

- **Collecting 140,000 signatures**: This is a specific and verifiable claim. If true, it would indicate significant support for the initiative.
- **""Ground"" in the Sejm**: The term ""ground"" is unclear in this context. It could imply that the signatures were ignored, dismissed, or not properly considered. This part of the claim is more subjective and harder to verify without additional context.

Given the lack of context and the ambiguity of the term ""ground,"" it's difficult to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false. However, the specificity of the number of signatures collected suggests some basis in fact, while the term ""ground"" introduces uncertainty.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a precise answer, but I can offer a general assessment based on typical economic trends.

Economic growth rates can vary significantly between countries and over time. Historically, Poland has often experienced higher economic growth rates compared to Hungary. For instance, from the early 2000s to the present, Poland has generally maintained higher GDP growth rates than Hungary.

However, to definitively label the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False', we would need to examine specific economic data for the period in question. In the absence of such data, a general understanding of economic trends suggests that Poland has indeed grown faster than Hungary in recent decades.

Professors of the University of California (UCLA) Gordon Klein was temporarily removed from work because he refused to postpone exams for students of African American,true,ru,"The claim about UCLA professor Gordon Klein being temporarily removed from work because he refused to postpone exams for African American students is somewhat complex and has been a subject of debate. While it is true that Klein was temporarily removed from his teaching duties, the context surrounding his removal includes nuances that make the claim not entirely accurate. Klein's removal was related to his response to a student's request for leniency due to the emotional impact of the George Floyd protests, but it was not solely about refusing to postpone exams for African American students. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true but also not entirely false.

The claim suggests that Brammertz has no doubts about political will, no professional objections to operational aspects, and that there is full cooperation with the tribunal in terms of witnesses, documentation delivery, and access to archives. Without specific context or external verification, it's challenging to definitively determine the accuracy of these statements. However, based on the information provided, the claim presents a strong assertion of cooperation and lack of objections.

However, the statement lacks specific context, such as the country or jurisdiction it refers to, which is crucial for determining its accuracy.

In many countries that have adopted the opt-out system, individuals are indeed presumed to be organ donors unless they explicitly opt out during their lifetime or their relatives express disagreement after their death. However, public opinion and the specifics of implementation can vary widely.

Without additional context, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false. However, based on the general understanding of opt-out systems, the statement is plausible but may not be universally applicable or accurate in all contexts.

The statement suggests that the Kragujevac-Batocino Highway is a priority for the government primarily due to a contract with Fiat.

Here are some factors to consider:

1. **Government Priorities**: Governments often prioritize infrastructure projects based on economic and strategic benefits.
2. **Contract with Fiat**: If there is a significant contract or agreement with Fiat that would benefit from the highway, it could indeed be a driving factor.
3. **Public Statements and Plans**: Official statements from government officials or documented plans can provide evidence supporting or refuting the claim.

Without specific details or sources to verify the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if the highway's construction is indeed tied to a significant contract with Fiat and this has been publicly acknowledged, the statement could be considered mostly accurate.

2. ""brought to Poland"": This indicates that the black box was physically transported to Poland.
3. ""is in Polish hands"": This implies that the black box is under the control or possession of Polish authorities.

However, without specific data, we can analyze the plausibility of the claim.

1. **Context and Sources**: The claim mentions specific numbers (1500 protests and 53 cases agreed with the applicant). Verifying these numbers would require access to official records from the Supreme Court or election authorities.

2. **Plausibility**: It is plausible that not all protests lead to agreement with the applicant, and that some cases involve irregularities in individual circuits. However, without concrete data, we cannot confirm the exact numbers.

3. **General Trends**: Election protests often result in a mix of outcomes, with some being upheld and others dismissed. The specific numbers mentioned could be true, mostly true, or false depending on the actual data.

The claim seems to suggest that each Kazakhstani should have access to or possess the equivalent of $9,000 USD. This could be interpreted in various ways, such as personal wealth, access to resources, or economic conditions.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to definitively say whether this claim is true or false. However, based on general economic indicators and the average income levels in Kazakhstan, it is unlikely that every individual, including babies and the elderly, has access to $9,000 USD.

The claim specifies the team consisted of:

- 5 tax law professors
- 3 judges of an administrative court
- 3 representatives of tax authorities
- 3 representatives of tax advisory companies
- 1 representative of the president

Without specific evidence or documentation to verify these exact numbers and roles, we can only make an educated guess based on the plausibility and typical composition of such teams. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Tax Law Professors**: It is plausible that tax law professors would be involved in developing tax code assumptions due to their expertise.
2. **Judges of an Administrative Court**: Including judges ensures legal expertise and understanding of administrative law.
3. **Representatives of Tax Authorities**: Their involvement ensures practical insights from the enforcement side.
4. **Representatives of Tax Advisory Companies**: They bring in the perspective of taxpayers and practical application of tax laws.
5. **Representative of the President**: This could be a political or executive overseer ensuring alignment with broader policy goals.

Given the diverse expertise required for such a task, the composition described seems reasonable. However, without concrete evidence, we cannot confirm the exact numbers and roles. Therefore, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' if these are typical roles involved in such processes, but without verification, it cannot be labeled as entirely 'True'.

1. **Priests pay PLN 243 of the flat-rate tax quarterly:**
   - According to Polish tax law, priests are subject to a flat-rate income tax known as ""ryczałt."" The specific amount can vary, but as of recent information, it is indeed around PLN 243 per quarter.

2. **The average taxpayer pays 2500 PLN quarterly of such a PIT tax:**
   - The average tax amount for individual taxpayers (PIT - Podatek dochodowy od osób fizycznych) can vary widely depending on income levels and other factors. The claim states that the average is PLN 2500 quarterly, but without specific data to back this up, it's challenging to verify its accuracy universally.

Given the information available:

- The claim about priests' tax is accurate based on recent tax regulations.
- The claim about the average taxpayer's quarterly tax lacks specific data to be universally accurate.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but requires more context and data for full verification.

1. The average salary in January was over 460 euros.
2. The average salary in January was 462 euros.
3. The average salary in March is expected to be 40 percent more than it was in 2014.

First, we need to verify each part of the claim with reliable sources. Let's assume we have access to data on average salaries in Serbia from official government statistics or a reputable economic report.

1. **Average salary in January over 460 euros:** If official data confirms that the average salary in January was indeed over 460 euros, this part is true.

2. **Average salary in January was 462 euros:** If the official data specifically states that the average salary was exactly 462 euros, this part is true.

3. **Average salary in March is 40 percent more than in 2014:** To verify this, we need to know the average salary in 2014 and compare it to the expected salary in March. If the expected salary in March is indeed 40 percent higher than the salary in 2014, this part is true.

Without specific data, we can't definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have verified the data:

- The average salary in January was indeed 462 euros.
- The average salary in 2014 was, for example, 300 euros.
- The expected average salary in March is 420 euros (which is 40 percent more than 300 euros).

1. **Government Structures and Gender Equality:** Many European countries have ministries, departments, or agencies dedicated to gender equality. These bodies are often under the direct supervision of a minister or a high-ranking official.

2. **Hierarchical Levels:** The claim suggests that the body for gender equality is ""highly raised - in addition to the Prime Minister."" This implies that the body is at a level equivalent to or just below the Prime Minister, which is unusual in most government structures.

3. **Comparative Analysis:** Without specific examples, it's challenging to verify the claim that no other governments in the Western Balkans or the EU have a similar structure. However, it is known that several countries have high-level bodies dedicated to gender equality, often integrated into ministries or directly reporting to cabinet-level officials.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support the claim that this structure is unique throughout Europe, and considering that many countries do have high-level bodies for gender equality, the claim seems exaggerated.

2. **""Primarily I mean the city traffic company.""**
   - This specifies that the primary recipient of these subsidies is the city traffic company.

The claim combines both quantitative (subsidies are falling) and qualitative (the company is improving) elements. Without specific data on the subsidies and the financial health of the city traffic company, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, the claim acknowledges that subsidies are still present but decreasing, and that the company is taking steps to improve its financial situation.

This claim is quite alarming and requires careful examination.

In modern psychiatry, diagnoses are typically based on established criteria outlined in diagnostic manuals such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). These manuals provide specific guidelines for diagnosing various mental health conditions. While there can be debates and disagreements within the field, the idea that diagnoses are now based on blurry criteria without clinical manifestations, laboratory data, or objective information is not accurate.

The use of psychiatry for punitive purposes has been a historical concern, particularly in authoritarian regimes, but it is not a widespread or accepted practice in contemporary, evidence-based psychiatry. Ethical guidelines and professional standards aim to prevent such misuse.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the dinar, which could refer to several currencies such as the Kuwaiti dinar or the Serbian dinar, has historically been relatively stable compared to some other currencies in their respective regions. However, claiming that it is among the most stable currencies in Europe is a strong assertion that would require detailed economic data and comparative analysis to support.

However, based on the statement alone, if we assume the speaker is being truthful about having talked to all partners and the nature of the discussions, we can assess it as follows:

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, the claim can only be evaluated in a general context. Credit rating agencies typically provide detailed reasons for rating changes, which might include factors such as fiscal policy, public debt levels, and economic indicators.

Given that the claim attributes the cause solely to the ""poor work in public finances"" without considering other potential factors, it is likely an oversimplification.

2. **""because it is just another printed slip to be rounded.""**: This part of the statement is unclear and seems to be a metaphor that doesn't directly relate to the political process in a logical way.

The key point is whether extraordinary elections affect the election cycle. In most parliamentary systems, extraordinary elections are called outside the regular election cycle, often due to specific circumstances like a vote of no confidence or a constitutional crisis. These elections typically reset the election cycle, meaning the claim that they would not expire the parliamentary election cycle is generally incorrect.

However, if we interpret ""Feminitivians"" to mean the inclusion of feminine forms in language (such as using gender-specific terms for professions or roles), then the claim can be evaluated based on the importance of linguistic inclusivity and representation. Many linguists and sociologists argue that inclusive language is necessary for fostering equality and respect in society.

For the increase to be less than 10%, the following must be true:
\[ \frac{30,000}{X} < 0.10 \]
\[ X > \frac{30,000}{0.10} \]
\[ X > 300,000 \]

This means that if the total number of children before the increase is greater than 300,000, then an increase of 30,000 children would indeed be less than a 10% increase.

Without specific data on the total number of children, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, if we assume that the total number of children is much larger than 300,000, the claim that the increase is ""not even ten percent"" could be plausible.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim seems to be a reasonable estimate but cannot be fully verified. Therefore, it is likely a mix of true and speculative elements.

"We have more and more supplies of liquefied gas to Poland by the LNG terminal in Świnoujście.The possibility of these supplies increased enormously.Initially, it was 8.5 billion m3 of gas, today it is already 23 billion so far.",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the capacity and actual supply figures of the LNG terminal in Świnoujście, Poland.

The LNG terminal in Świnoujście initially had a capacity of 5 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year. However, with expansions and improvements, the capacity has indeed increased. As of recent reports, the terminal's capacity has been expanded to handle more LNG, but the exact figure of 23 billion cubic meters needs verification.

The claim states that the initial capacity was 8.5 bcm and has now increased to 23 bcm. The initial capacity figure of 8.5 bcm seems incorrect based on available data, which suggests an initial capacity closer to 5 bcm. The current capacity, while increased, is not widely reported as 23 bcm, though it has indeed grown significantly.

Given the discrepancy in the initial capacity figure and the uncertainty around the exact current capacity, the claim is not entirely accurate but does reflect a significant increase in capacity.

2. **Impact on the national budget and salaries/pensions**: The claim suggests that if every city had a program like Jagodina's, there would be surpluses in the national budget, and salaries and pensions would be greater. This is a hypothetical scenario and is difficult to prove or disprove without detailed economic analysis and modeling.

Given that the first part of the claim is specific but unverified, and the second part is hypothetical and difficult to prove, the most accurate rating would be:

2. **Verification of Numbers**: Without specific data or sources to verify the exact numbers, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.

3. **Context and Interpretation**: The claim could be interpreted in different ways. If ""about 650"" means a significant portion but not necessarily the majority, then the claim might be partially true. However, if ""about 650"" is meant to imply that the majority joined the party, then the claim could be misleading.

According to various economic indicators and cost-of-living indices, Serbia has historically been among the more affordable countries in Europe. In 2009, Serbia was still recovering from economic and political transitions, which likely contributed to lower prices compared to many other European countries.

While specific European statistics and data organization reports from 2009 may not be readily available, general economic trends and comparative studies from that period support the notion that Serbia had lower prices for food, beverages, and overall cost of living compared to many other European nations.

Given this context, the claim that Serbia was classified among countries with the smallest prices of food and beverages, and among the cheapest for life, is likely to be mostly accurate.

2. The duration of the construction process.

Given that I don't have real-time data or specific context about the actions of Platforma Obywatelska and the construction timeline of a gas terminal, I can provide a general approach to evaluating such a claim:

1. **Involvement of Platforma Obywatelska:** Check official records, statements, and projects associated with Platforma Obywatelska to see if they have indeed been involved in the construction of a gas terminal.
2. **Duration of Construction:** Verify the timeline of the construction through reliable sources such as government reports, news articles, and project documentation.

1. **Factual Accuracy of Debt-to-GDP Ratio**: If the debt-to-GDP ratio is indeed 80%, this part of the claim is factually accurate.

2. **Interpretation of ""Highly Indebted""**: Whether a debt-to-GDP ratio of 80% qualifies a country as ""highly indebted"" is more subjective and depends on the context. Generally, debt-to-GDP ratios above 60% are often considered high, but this can vary based on economic context, regional standards, and other factors.

Given these points, while the debt-to-GDP ratio might be factually accurate, the interpretation of ""highly indebted"" could be debated. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but also not entirely true.

1. **Context and Consistency**: If GFK Polonia published both 6.5% and 7.5% support for J. Palikot, it would imply inconsistency or different polls at different times.
2. **Clarity**: The claim lacks clarity on whether these are results from different polls or a discrepancy in reporting.

Without access to specific data sources, I can provide a general approach to verifying such claims:

1. **Check Official Trade Statistics**: Look at reports from Serbia's Statistical Office or equivalent government bodies that track trade data.
2. **Consult International Trade Databases**: Use databases like the UN Comtrade, World Bank, or Eurostat to find trade figures for Serbia in 2010.
3. **Cross-Reference with Economic Reports**: Review economic reports and analyses from reputable sources that discuss Serbia's trade in 2010.

Assuming the figures provided are accurate based on these sources, the claim can be evaluated as follows:

If the claim is that there have been no changes in these areas, it's highly unlikely that this is entirely true, as economic conditions, market dynamics, and supply chains are constantly evolving. Therefore, a claim of no change at all would likely be an oversimplification.

"There is a matter of delegated employees, fundamental from the point of view of Polish interests.I remind you that eleven national parliaments gave the European Commission a yellow card in this matter.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components:

1. **Delegated employees and Polish interests**: The claim suggests that the matter of delegated employees is important for Polish interests. This part is subjective and depends on the context of Polish politics and economic policies, but it is generally plausible that a country would have an interest in matters related to its workforce.

2. **Yellow card by eleven national parliaments**: The yellow card procedure is a mechanism that allows national parliaments to express concerns about a European Commission proposal if they believe it violates the principle of subsidiarity. If one-third of national parliaments raise objections, the Commission must review the proposal.

Given the specificity of the claim about eleven national parliaments issuing a yellow card, it is crucial to verify if this event actually occurred. Without concrete evidence or a specific reference to the incident, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of this part of the claim.

**Analysis**:
- The first part of the claim about the importance of delegated employees to Polish interests is subjective but plausible.
- The second part about the yellow card by eleven national parliaments is specific and verifiable but requires confirmation from credible sources.

Without specific evidence to support the second part of the claim, it is challenging to determine its absolute truth. Therefore, the claim can be considered partially credible but lacking full verification.

Without specific data or sources to verify the claim, it is difficult to definitively determine its accuracy. However, based on the information provided, we can make a general assessment.

If there is substantial evidence from reliable sources that Salford holds approximately 60 percent of the market, then the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the evidence is mixed or contradictory, the claim might be 'Half True'.

Since I don't have real-time data or specific statistics, I'll provide a general framework for how to assess such a claim:

1. **True**: The claim is supported by reliable data that shows a 23% increase in building permits issued in August this year compared to the same month last year.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim is generally accurate but may have minor discrepancies or slight variations in the data.
3. **Half True**: The claim is partially correct but may have significant inaccuracies or missing context.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim is largely inaccurate, with data showing a much smaller increase or even a decrease in building permits.
5. **False**: The claim is entirely inaccurate, with data showing no increase or a decrease in building permits.

Without specific data, it's impossible to assign a definitive label. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to reliable data that shows a significant increase in building permits, but not exactly 23%. The actual increase might be close, but not precisely 23%.

"""If you compare the current composition of ministers with the number of members of the Government of 2000, even before, you will see that this cabinet is not bulky.""",half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we would need to compare the number of ministers in the current cabinet with the number in the year 2000 and earlier. Without specific data, a general analysis can be provided based on typical trends in government composition.

1. **Current Composition**: The size of government cabinets can vary widely depending on the country and political context. It is not uncommon for cabinets to have 20-30 members, but this can be higher or lower.

2. **2000 and Earlier**: Historically, cabinets have varied in size, but there is a general trend towards larger cabinets over time due to the increasing complexity of governance and the need to represent diverse interests.

3. **Comparison**: If the current cabinet has a similar or slightly larger number of ministers compared to the year 2000 or earlier, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the current cabinet is significantly smaller, the claim would be 'True'. If it is significantly larger, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data, a precise evaluation cannot be made. However, based on general trends and assuming typical cabinet sizes, the claim that the current cabinet is not bulky compared to the year 2000 or earlier could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

"630 people died of a million inhabitants in Spain (...), and in Poland 65 (on Covid -19 - note Demagog).",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the reported COVID-19 death rates for Spain and Poland. As of my last update in October 2023, the claim states that 630 people died out of a million inhabitants in Spain and 65 people died out of a million inhabitants in Poland.

To verify this, we should look at reliable sources providing COVID-19 statistics, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), national health agencies, or reputable news outlets.

As of my last update, the COVID-19 death rates per million inhabitants were approximately:
- Spain: Around 1,800-2,000 deaths per million.
- Poland: Around 2,000-2,500 deaths per million.

Given these figures, the claim that Spain had 630 deaths per million and Poland had 65 deaths per million is significantly lower than the actual reported numbers.

Without access to such specific data, it is impossible to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume the claim is based on a hypothetical survey or report that is not widely recognized or corroborated by multiple sources.

Given the lack of verifiable data, the claim could be considered speculative or unverified. Therefore, it would be prudent to classify it as:

Today we have more and more suicides in schools.,half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim ""Today we have more and more suicides in schools,"" we would need to examine statistical data and trends related to youth suicides and specifically those occurring in school settings. However, without access to real-time data and comprehensive studies, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.

That said, it's important to note that mental health and suicide prevention are significant concerns globally, and there has been an increase in awareness and discussion around these issues in recent years. Some studies and reports have indicated rising rates of suicide among youth, but the specific claim about ""more and more suicides in schools"" would require detailed statistical evidence to confirm.

Given the lack of specific data presented in the claim, a cautious approach would be to consider it as not fully substantiated without further evidence.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to current data or specific trade statistics for the most recent year. However, I can provide a general approach to how one would verify this claim:

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look at official trade statistics from the governments of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Both countries often publish annual trade reports.
2. **International Trade Databases**: Refer to international trade databases such as those maintained by the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), or the United Nations COMTRADE database.
3. **News Reports**: Check reliable news sources that might report on trade volumes between the two countries.

Given the lack of real-time data access, I can't provide a definitive answer based on the most recent statistics. However, if the claim aligns with recent trends and reports from reliable sources, it would likely be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If there are significant discrepancies or a lack of supporting data, it might be considered 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

**Final Answer:** Without current data, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. For an accurate assessment, please refer to the most recent official trade statistics or reliable news reports.",,False,True

"While Germany is our greatest trading partner, Great Britain is our second trading partner in order.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at current trade data. As of recent years, Germany is indeed the top trading partner for many European countries. However, the second-largest trading partner can vary depending on the specific country in question. For instance, for some countries, the second-largest trading partner might be the United States, China, or other European nations.

Without specific data for a particular country, we cannot definitively say that Great Britain is the second-largest trading partner for any given country. Therefore, the claim is not universally accurate.

After vaccination with OPV, the vaccine-derived poliovirus can indeed be found in the blood, urine, and respiratory tract of a vaccinated child for a certain period. This is because the live virus replicates in the gut and can be shed through various bodily fluids.

However, the statement uses the term ""Corey virus,"" which is not a recognized medical term. If we assume this is a typo and the statement is actually referring to the poliovirus, then the claim is mostly accurate.

1. ""In the first half of 2020, the SMB increased a microcredit portfolio by 850%.""
2. ""At the same time, overdue debt increased by 238% of the main debt or accrued reward, including.""
3. ""For individuals, the growth of microcredit was about 145%, overdue debt increased by 332%.""

Without specific data or context, it's difficult to verify the exact percentages. However, large percentage increases in microcredit portfolios and overdue debt are not uncommon, especially during times of economic uncertainty like the first half of 2020, which was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The claim provides specific numbers, which could be accurate if sourced from a reliable report or data set. However, without verification from an authoritative source, the claim cannot be deemed entirely true or false.

Given the plausibility of the numbers in the context of economic trends but lacking specific verification, the claim can be considered partially accurate.

The claim states that this is not true and that the ecological tax is only a few percent compared to the price.

If the environmental taxes are indeed only a few percent of the device's price, it is unlikely that they would cause a twenty percent price increase. Therefore, the claim that many devices will not rise by twenty percent due to environmental taxes is likely accurate.

"Euthanasia is probably in two countries of the European Union, two or three countries.",true,pl,"The claim that ""Euthanasia is probably in two countries of the European Union, two or three countries"" is somewhat ambiguous but can be evaluated based on current information. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, euthanasia is legally permitted in a few countries within the European Union, including the Netherlands and Belgium. Luxembourg also allows euthanasia, making it three countries in total. Therefore, the claim is mostly correct but slightly underestimates the number of countries.

1. **Poland**: The claim states that schools were closed when there were ""30 several cases"" of coronavirus found. This phrasing is unclear, but it suggests a relatively low number of cases. In reality, Poland closed schools on March 11, 2020, when the number of confirmed cases was relatively low but likely more than 30.

2. **France**: The claim states that schools were closed when there were 2,000 cases found. France announced the closure of schools on March 12, 2020. By that date, the number of confirmed cases in France was indeed around 2,000.

Given the information available:
- The claim about France is accurate.
- The claim about Poland is less precise due to the phrasing ""30 several cases,"" which is ambiguous.

Considering both parts, the claim is partially accurate but not entirely precise.

Grande Parte Da Mídia Achava Que Ele [Cesare Battisti] Era Um Pobre Coitado,half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim ""Grande Parte Da Mídia Achava Que Ele [Cesare Battisti] Era Um Pobre Coitado,"" we need to consider the media coverage and public opinion surrounding Cesare Battisti.

Cesare Battisti is a controversial figure known for his involvement in the Italian left-wing terrorist group Armed Proletarians for Communism (PAC) during the 1970s. He was convicted in absentia for four murders and sentenced to life imprisonment in Italy. Battisti fled Italy and lived in various countries, including France and Brazil, where he gained a significant amount of media attention and support from certain segments of the public and media.

During his time in France and Brazil, some media outlets and public figures portrayed Battisti as a victim of political persecution or a misunderstood revolutionary, rather than focusing on his criminal convictions. This portrayal was not universal, and there was also significant criticism and demands for his extradition from other media outlets and governments.

Given the mixed and often polarized media coverage of Cesare Battisti, it is accurate to say that a significant portion of the media did portray him in a sympathetic light. However, it is not accurate to say that this was the predominant view across all media outlets.

1. **""The most cited scientific journal (according to 2019 Journal Citation Reports) in the field of immunology""**: As of the 2019 Journal Citation Reports, the most cited journal in the field of immunology is indeed a highly respected journal, but it's important to verify if it's specifically ""The Journal of Immunology.""

2. **""The Journal of Immunology has published an article 'Understanding the essence of the mechanism of action of highly exposed biological preparations' on the mechanism of action of domestic 'Ergoferon'.""**: This part of the claim needs to be verified by checking the actual publications in ""The Journal of Immunology.""

Given that I cannot access specific databases or journals in real-time, I will base my assessment on general knowledge and typical practices in academic publishing:

- It is plausible that ""The Journal of Immunology"" is a highly cited journal in the field of immunology.
- The specific article title and content regarding ""Ergoferon"" would need to be verified through the journal's archives or other reliable sources.

Without direct access to the journal's archives, the claim cannot be fully confirmed or denied. Therefore, the best assessment based on the information provided is:

"""Without our coalition, there will be no new governments, unless Democrats and Progressives form a majority.""",true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the political context and the rules for government formation in the given political system. The claim suggests that without the coalition in question, new governments cannot be formed unless Democrats and Progressives form a majority. Here's a breakdown:

1. **True**: This would mean that the coalition is absolutely necessary for the formation of any new government, except in the case where Democrats and Progressives have a majority.
2. **Mostly True**: This would imply that the statement is generally accurate but might have minor exceptions or nuances.
3. **Half True**: This would suggest that the statement has elements of truth but also significant inaccuracies or oversimplifications.
4. **Mostly False**: This would mean that the statement is largely inaccurate but might contain a kernel of truth.
5. **False**: This would indicate that the statement is entirely incorrect.

Without specific details about the political system, the current balance of power, and the rules for government formation, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general political theory:

- In many parliamentary systems, governments can be formed through various coalition arrangements. The necessity of any specific coalition depends on the distribution of seats and the willingness of parties to cooperate.
- If Democrats and Progressives can form a majority, they can indeed form a government without needing other coalitions.

Given the lack of specific context, the claim seems plausible but could be overly simplistic. It's likely that the coalition is important but not necessarily the only possible configuration for government formation.

2. This fee is widespread.
3. The fee is ""twice lower"" than the subscription.

Without specific data or context, such as the actual amounts of the fees or what constitutes ""widespread,"" it's challenging to verify this claim accurately.

"I remember Tusk's expose from 2011. He said then that he would not kneel from bishops, that he would liquidate the church fund.",half true,pl,"To accurately evaluate the claim, we need to examine the historical context and statements made by Donald Tusk, who was Prime Minister of Poland from 2007 to 2014. In 2011, there were indeed discussions about church-state relations and financial matters involving the Catholic Church in Poland.

The claim contains two main points:
1. Tusk said he would not kneel before bishops.
2. Tusk said he would liquidate the church fund.

Let's evaluate each point:

1. **Not kneeling before bishops**: This statement is somewhat metaphorical and could refer to Tusk's stance on maintaining the separation of church and state, rather than a literal act of kneeling. Tusk did express views that the state should be independent from religious influence, which could be interpreted as not ""kneeling"" before bishops.

2. **Liquidate the church fund**: In 2011, there were discussions about reforming the financial relationship between the state and the Catholic Church. Tusk's government proposed changes that would affect the ""Fundusz Kościelny,"" a fund that supported church activities. However, the use of the term ""liquidate"" might be an exaggeration. The proposals aimed to restructure and make the funding more transparent rather than completely eliminate it.

Given these points, the claim is a mix of accurate interpretations and some exaggeration. Tusk did advocate for changes that would affect the church fund and assert the state's independence from religious influence, but the claim that he would ""liquidate"" the church fund is not entirely accurate.

However, for the sake of explanation, let's assume we have access to reliable sources indicating the voting patterns of the SLD on this issue. If a majority of SLD members indeed voted in favor of raising the retirement age, the claim would be true. If the vote was split but the majority still favored raising the retirement age, it could be considered mostly true. If the vote was nearly evenly split, it might be considered half true.

The claim suggests that animal production has decreased every year from 1910 to 2013, eventually falling below 1910 levels. However, this claim contradicts widely accepted data and trends in agriculture and animal husbandry.

1. **Global Trends in Animal Production**: Historically, animal production has generally increased over time due to advancements in agriculture, animal husbandry, and technological improvements. The global demand for meat and dairy products has also risen with population growth and economic development.

2. **FAO Data**: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) provides data on global livestock production. According to FAO statistics, global meat and dairy production have shown a steady increase over the past century, not a decline.

   - The claim states that ""Poland will also defend these territories,"" which could be interpreted as Poland having a specific, independent responsibility for the Baltic states' defense. While Poland, as a NATO member, would be part of collective defense efforts, NATO's plans do not single out Poland as solely responsible for defending the Baltic states.
   - The phrase ""eventual plans"" is vague and could be misleading. NATO's contingency plans were not just ""eventual"" but rather immediate measures to ensure the security of all member states.

Given these points, the claim is partly accurate but also somewhat misleading.

"""It is a shame that the largest number of social assistance beneficiaries in the richest piece of Serbia and no one is proud of such Vojvodina.""",half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The largest number of social assistance beneficiaries in the richest piece of Serbia.""
2. ""No one is proud of such Vojvodina.""

The first part requires factual verification regarding the number of social assistance beneficiaries in Vojvodina compared to other regions of Serbia and the economic status of Vojvodina. The second part is subjective and cannot be objectively verified as it pertains to emotions and opinions.

Without specific data to confirm the number of social assistance beneficiaries and the economic status of Vojvodina relative to other regions, we cannot definitively say whether the first part is true or false. However, the second part is inherently subjective and cannot be fact-checked.

Given the lack of concrete data and the subjective nature of the second part, the claim is at best partially verifiable.

However, this claim assumes that the content and format of the questionnaire are already known, which may not be the case. Additionally, it presumes that the recipients will accept and process the pre-emptive answers, which is not guaranteed. Therefore, while there might be some truth to the potential time-saving, the claim also contains significant assumptions that could render it inaccurate.

1. **Germany**: The claim mentions that Germany's deficit is extremely low and not comparable to other countries. This is generally true, as Germany has maintained a relatively low deficit compared to other EU countries.

2. **France**: The claim states that France has two and a half times a larger deficit than Serbia. To verify this, we would need specific data on the deficits of France and Serbia.

Without specific data, we can't definitively confirm the exact ratio of the deficits. However, we can assess the general plausibility based on known economic trends:

- Germany typically has a lower deficit compared to other EU countries.
- France has had higher deficits compared to Germany and some other EU countries.

Given the lack of precise data, the claim that France has two and a half times a larger deficit than Serbia is speculative. However, the general trend of Germany having a lower deficit and France having a higher deficit compared to other EU countries is plausible.

I expect that we will have the largest rate of economic growth in the region next year.,mostly true,sr,"To evaluate the claim ""I expect that we will have the largest rate of economic growth in the region next year,"" we need to consider several factors, including the credibility of the source, the current economic conditions, historical trends, and any available forecasts or projections.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given that it is an expectation for the future, it falls into the realm of prediction rather than a statement of current fact. Predictions can vary widely based on assumptions and models used.

Without specific data on the initial and final amounts of the benefits, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim precisely.

However, an increase of PLN 9 over 8 years seems relatively small and might not align with typical increases in benefits over such a period. Without additional information, this claim could be considered questionable.

"In Germany, when the beer consumption grew for years, it dragged hops behind it.In Poland, you have a twenty -time increase in beer consumption and a decrease in hop production.",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider both the trends in beer consumption and hop production in Germany and Poland.

1. **Germany**: The claim suggests that as beer consumption grew in Germany, hop production also increased. Germany is known for its beer culture, and historically, increased beer consumption has indeed led to higher demand for hops, a key ingredient in beer. This part of the claim aligns with general economic principles of supply and demand.

2. **Poland**: The claim states that Poland saw a twenty-fold increase in beer consumption but a decrease in hop production. This part is more complex. While Poland has seen significant growth in beer consumption, the decrease in hop production could be due to various factors such as changes in agricultural practices, economic shifts, or importing hops from other countries.

Given the mixed nature of the claim, where one part is generally true (Germany) and the other is more nuanced and potentially misleading without additional context (Poland), the overall accuracy of the claim can be considered ""Half True.""

"We have the seventh year from a seven -year perspective, and we have released less than 46%, from 60 billion 27 only went to farmers' accounts, and in activities modernization of farms is even worse, because less than 1/3.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the provided information:

1. ""We have the seventh year from a seven-year perspective"": This suggests that the time frame in question is the seventh year out of a seven-year period.

2. ""We have released less than 46%"": This implies that less than 46% of a certain fund or allocation has been released.

3. ""From 60 billion, 27 only went to farmers' accounts"": This suggests that out of a total of 60 billion, only 27 billion has been released to farmers' accounts.

4. ""In activities modernization of farms is even worse, because less than 1/3"": This indicates that in terms of farm modernization activities, less than one-third of the intended allocation has been utilized.

Without additional context or specific data to verify these claims, we can only assess the internal consistency and plausibility of the statements. The claim that less than 46% has been released and that only 27 out of 60 billion has gone to farmers' accounts seems to align with the statement that less than one-third has been used for farm modernization activities.

However, without external verification or specific data to confirm these figures, it is challenging to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false. Given the information provided, the claim appears to be internally consistent but lacks external verification.

1. The level of coverage of imports by exports is 58 percent.
2. This is the highest degree Serbia has had in this century.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify the exact figures. However, let's break down the claim based on typical economic indicators:

1. **Level of Coverage**: If the coverage of imports by exports is indeed 58 percent, this means that for every $100 of imports, Serbia exports $58 worth of goods and services. This is a specific claim that can be verified with economic data.

2. **Highest Degree in This Century**: This claim suggests that the 58 percent coverage is the best Serbia has achieved since the year 2000. This is a historical comparison that also requires economic data for verification.

Given the nature of the claim, it is likely based on specific economic reports or data. If the data supports both points, the claim would be accurate. However, without verifying the actual data, we cannot definitively say it is 'True'. It could be 'Mostly True' if the data supports the general trend but not the exact figures, or 'Half True' if only one of the points is accurate.

   - The statement about the child returning from school and going for bread is an oversimplification. The specifics depend on the child's age, maturity, and circumstances.
   - The statement about Zoom and pornography is complex. While parents should indeed protect their children, the responsibility for blocking internet resources often falls on both parents and the state, and the specifics can vary by jurisdiction.

- If the individual is indeed the Prime Minister, the claim about their position is true.
- The claim about not having the largest number of mandates but the largest number of votes is somewhat ambiguous and would require specific electoral data to verify.

The claim states that this program led to the liquidation of 13 mines, significant reduction in mining at another 10, and the departure of over 100,000 workers, representing more than 42% of the initial workforce.

Historically, the mining restructuring program in Poland during the period mentioned was indeed substantial and aimed at reducing the size and costs of the coal mining sector. The program did involve the closure and downsizing of numerous mines, leading to significant job losses.

However, without specific data, we can make a general assessment based on common patterns observed in countries that have joined the EU.

1. **Immediate Post-Accession Emigration**: Typically, when a country joins the EU, there is an initial surge in emigration as new opportunities become available and labor markets open up. This is often due to the freedom of movement within the EU, which allows citizens of new member states to work and live in other EU countries.

2. **Stable Emigration Levels**: Over time, emigration tends to stabilize as the initial surge of emigrants settles into new lives abroad and the economy of the new member state improves, providing more opportunities at home.

Energy intensity is a measure of the energy inefficiency of an economy, and Poland's energy sector is known to be less efficient due to its reliance on coal and older technologies. Additionally, it is common for a significant amount of primary energy to be lost during conversion, transport, and distribution processes in many economies, not just Poland.

Additionally, VAERS reports can be submitted by anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, and family members, and they vary widely in quality and completeness.

To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to:

1. Access the VAERS database to verify the reported numbers of disabilities, deaths, cervical dysplasia cases, and cervical cancer cases associated with HPV vaccination from 2006 to 2019.
2. Consider the limitations of VAERS data, including the lack of causality and potential reporting biases.

Without direct access to the VAERS database and specific verification of the numbers, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. However, given the known limitations of VAERS data and the lack of causality, it's reasonable to approach such claims with caution.

**Final Answer: Half True**

This designation reflects the possibility that the numbers reported might be accurate, but the interpretation of these numbers as causally linked to HPV vaccination is not supported by VAERS data alone.",,False,True

1. **Poland has been an ally of Israel for many years**: This is generally true. Poland and Israel share a historical and cultural bond, and Poland has often been supportive of Israel in international forums.

2. **Poland abstained in a recent UN Security Council vote, which was effectively supporting Israel**: Without specific details on the vote in question, it's challenging to verify this part of the claim. However, abstaining from a vote can sometimes be seen as a form of indirect support, depending on the context.

Given the general historical context and the typical interpretation of abstentions in votes, the claim is mostly accurate but lacks specificity to be fully verified.

"Judges (CT) were elected, who can, should already, three should already take their office, because the term of office of previous on November 6 ended.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the typical procedures for judges taking office. Generally, judges who are elected are expected to take their office soon after the election, especially when the term of the previous judges has ended. However, the claim does not specify the exact date of the election or any potential delays that might affect the timeline.

Given the standard procedures, it is likely that the three judges should already have taken their office if the term of the previous judges ended on November 6. However, without specific details about the election date or any extenuating circumstances, the claim cannot be definitively labeled as entirely true or false.

1. **Position and Authority**: The claim states that the individual was at the head of a Committee that controls the military and the police. This suggests a high-level position with significant authority.

2. **Introduction of Practice**: The claim also states that the individual introduced a practice requiring the Minister of Police and Army to apply for work on three months. This implies a change in policy or procedure.

Without specific details about the individual, the committee, or the context, it's challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, based on the general plausibility and the description of the role, it seems reasonably specific but still requires external verification.

Finland's lottery system, operated by Veikkaus, is indeed designed to contribute significantly to various cultural and sports initiatives. According to Veikkaus's annual reports and other official sources, a substantial portion of the profits from lottery activities is allocated to support sports, physical culture, art, and other cultural endeavors. While the exact amount may vary year to year, it is generally true that a significant sum, often in the hundreds of millions of euros, is directed towards these areas.

However, without the exact figure for a specific year or more detailed current data, it is difficult to confirm the precise amount of $1 billion. Given the general trend and the substantial contributions made, the claim can be considered mostly true.

The probability of die after vaccination is thousands of times higher than the probability of die from measles,false,ru,"The claim that ""The probability of dying after vaccination is thousands of times higher than the probability of dying from measles"" is not supported by scientific evidence and is contrary to well-established medical data. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and monitoring to ensure their safety, and the risk of serious adverse events, including death, is extremely low. In contrast, measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to serious complications and even death, especially in young children and immunocompromised individuals. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.

We must remember that this [anti -smog] law will largely eliminate the possibility of heating by coal stoves.In a situation where 70% of people in southern Poland are so heating.,true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the impact of the anti-smog law on the heating methods used in southern Poland. The claim states that the law will largely eliminate the possibility of heating by coal stoves and that 70% of people in southern Poland use coal stoves for heating.

1. **Impact of the Anti-Smog Law**: Anti-smog laws typically aim to reduce air pollution by restricting or banning the use of high-pollution heating methods, such as coal stoves. If the law is strict and effectively enforced, it could indeed largely eliminate the use of coal stoves for heating.

2. **Prevalence of Coal Stoves**: The claim asserts that 70% of people in southern Poland use coal stoves for heating. This statistic would need to be verified with reliable sources, but for the sake of this evaluation, let's assume it is accurate.

Given these points, the claim suggests a significant impact on a large portion of the population. If the anti-smog law is designed to phase out coal stoves and 70% of people in southern Poland rely on them, the claim has a strong basis in reality.

2. **Average Salary in Dollar Equivalent**: The claim states that the average salary fell by 25%. Again, this requires data on salary levels during the specified period to verify.

Without specific data to cross-reference, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as true or false. However, based on typical economic trends and the phrasing of the claim, it suggests a mix of facts that might not fully capture the complexity of the situation.

"Imported carpets in Uzbekistan are an excisable goods, and Uzbek manufacturers (exported carpets) enjoy the right to return VAT",true,ru,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the tax policies and regulations in Uzbekistan regarding imported carpets and the VAT return rights for Uzbek manufacturers who export carpets.

1. **Excisable Goods**: Excisable goods are typically those subject to excise taxes, which are often applied to specific goods like alcohol, tobacco, and certain luxury items. Carpets are generally not considered excisable goods in most countries, including Uzbekistan.

2. **VAT Return for Exported Goods**: Many countries, including Uzbekistan, allow manufacturers to reclaim the Value Added Tax (VAT) on goods that are exported. This is a common practice to encourage exports and make domestic products more competitive in international markets.

Based on these points:

- The claim that imported carpets in Uzbekistan are excisable goods is likely false, as carpets are not typically subject to excise taxes.
- The claim that Uzbek manufacturers enjoy the right to return VAT on exported carpets is likely true, as this is a common practice to support exports.

Considering both parts of the claim, the overall accuracy is mixed. The first part is false, while the second part is true.

1. The promise of a reduction in taxes and parafiscal imposes.
2. The actual change in the number of taxes from 360 to 384 (and potentially 385 with the new act).

Without specific data on the promises made by the government and the actual implementation of tax reductions, we can't definitively say whether the promise was kept. However, the claim states that the number of taxes has increased, which contradicts the promise of a reduction.

Given the information provided:
- The number of taxes has increased from 360 to 384, with a potential new tax making it 385.

1. **Interest Rate vs. Inflation Rate**: If the interest rate on dinar savings is indeed higher than the inflation rate, it suggests that the value of savings could increase over time. However, this alone does not guarantee safety.

2. **Currency Stability**: The stability of the dinar is crucial. If the currency is volatile or prone to devaluation, savings could lose value despite higher interest rates.

3. **Economic Conditions**: The broader economic context, including factors like political stability, economic growth, and fiscal policies, affects the safety of savings.

4. **Financial Institution Risk**: The safety of savings also depends on the reliability and financial health of the institutions where the dinars are deposited.

1. **Evidence of Programs**: There are indeed programs aimed at mental health diagnostics and treatment in educational settings. For example, some schools and districts have implemented mental health screening and support services.

2. **Scope and Scale**: The claim suggests a widespread implementation that could lead to mass diagnoses. While mental health programs are being implemented in various places, it's not clear if this is happening on a mass scale or if it is leading to a significant increase in diagnoses.

3. **Potential for Mass Diagnoses**: The concern about mass formulation of mental diagnoses is a valid point of debate. Some critics argue that increased screening could lead to overdiagnosis, while proponents argue that it ensures early intervention and support for children who need it.

As of recent data, the number is likely in the hundreds of thousands.

2. **Budget for Oncological Treatment**: The budget allocated for oncological treatment in Poland can vary yearly and depends on the government's health budget. PLN 1.5 billion (approximately USD 375 million) might be an underestimation or overestimation depending on the specific year and context.

Given these considerations, the claim that there are ""a million patients with cancer in Poland"" is likely an exaggeration, while the budget figure might be context-specific and not universally accurate.

- There is some evidence that the individual made this demand, but the exact details or the extent of their advocacy are not fully clear.

Given this hypothetical evidence, the claim would likely be considered 'Mostly True' because while there is evidence supporting the claim, the details might not be entirely clear or fully corroborated.

Without that information, it's impossible to verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. Identify the rating system: Determine what type of rating is being discussed (e.g., credit rating, economic ranking, etc.).
2. Check the current ratings: Look up the current ratings of the countries mentioned in the claim.
3. Compare the ratings: Assess whether the claim about the ratings is accurate based on the latest available data.

1. **""Serbia was before the bankruptcy three years ago""**: Serbia did face significant economic challenges but did not officially declare bankruptcy. This part of the claim is misleading.

2. **""Today it has a budget surplus""**: Serbia has made economic progress and has achieved a budget surplus in recent years. This part of the claim is accurate.

3. **""Economy growth significantly higher than the European average""**: Serbia's economic growth has been relatively strong, but comparing it to the European average requires specific data. Generally, Serbia's growth rates have been above the EU average in recent years, making this part of the claim mostly accurate.

4. **""Serbia has shown that he can win. And not only in basketball and water polo, but also in economics and politics.""**: This is a subjective statement about Serbia's achievements, which is difficult to quantify objectively. However, Serbia has made notable progress in various areas, including economics and politics.

Kazakhstan is a leader in Central Asia on the illegal conclusion of capital into offshore,half true,ru,"The claim that ""Kazakhstan is a leader in Central Asia on the illegal conclusion of capital into offshore"" is a complex one that requires careful examination of data and reports on illicit financial flows and offshore activities. However, without specific data to back up the claim, it is difficult to definitively say whether it is entirely true or false.

Here are some considerations:

1. **Illicit Financial Flows**: Illicit financial flows (IFFs) are a significant issue globally, and Central Asia is no exception. However, determining which country is the ""leader"" in such activities can be challenging due to the clandestine nature of these transactions.

2. **Offshore Activities**: Offshore financial centers are used for both legal and illegal purposes. Determining the extent to which Kazakhstan, or any other country, is involved in illegal offshore activities would require detailed investigative reports and data.

3. **Regional Context**: Central Asia includes several countries, and the economic and political situations vary among them. Without comparative data, it is difficult to assert that Kazakhstan is the leader in this regard.

Given the lack of specific data and the complexity of the issue, the claim can be considered neither entirely true nor entirely false. It is more accurate to say that it is 'Half True', as it may have some basis in reality but lacks sufficient evidence to be fully verified.

2. **Financial Stability**: A stable financial environment is attractive to investors.
3. **Labor Quality**: Highly skilled and productive labor can increase profitability.
4. **Comparison to the Environment**: The claim suggests that these factors make the region more profitable than others.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if the region genuinely offers advantages in tax policy, financial stability, and labor quality that outperform neighboring regions or competitors, the claim could be mostly true. If these advantages are marginal or not significantly better than other regions, the claim might be half true.

"""When I took over the government, only the two countries have recognized Kosovo's independence since.These are Antigua and Barbuda and Togo, if I'm not mistaken.Only those two countries, everything else I inherited. """,mostly true,sr,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we need to verify the number of countries that recognized Kosovo's independence during the specified period and compare it to the claim that only Antigua and Barbuda and Togo did so.

As of my last update in October 2023, the claim refers to a specific time frame and two specific countries. Without additional context or data, it's challenging to confirm the exact number of recognitions during that period. However, we can assess the claim based on general knowledge and typical patterns of international recognition.

Given that international recognition of Kosovo has been a gradual process involving multiple countries over time, it is plausible that a limited number of countries recognized Kosovo during a specific administration's tenure. However, without precise data, we cannot definitively confirm the claim that only Antigua and Barbuda and Togo recognized Kosovo during that period.

Based on the available information and the typical complexity of international recognition processes, the claim could be accurate but requires verification with specific data.

"Another amount of benefits is received by guardians of adult disabled people, and other carers of disabled children.This difference is very large, because in the case of children it is PLN 1,477, and in the case of adults PLN 520 and only for the least paid people.The Constitutional Tribunal ruled the unconstitutionality of this solution in 2014.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **Guardians of adult disabled people and other carers of disabled children receive different amounts of benefits.**
2. **The difference in benefits is substantial: PLN 1,477 for children and PLN 520 for adults, and only for the least paid people.**
3. **The Constitutional Tribunal ruled the unconstitutionality of this solution in 2014.**

To determine the accuracy of this claim, we need to verify each part:

1. **Different amounts of benefits for guardians of adult disabled people and carers of disabled children:** This is a common scenario in many countries, where benefits for caring for disabled children are often higher than for adults due to the higher level of care and support needed.

2. **The specific amounts mentioned (PLN 1,477 for children and PLN 520 for adults):** Without access to specific, up-to-date Polish benefit rates, this part is harder to verify without additional research. However, it is plausible that there could be such a discrepancy.

3. **The Constitutional Tribunal ruling in 2014:** This is a specific and verifiable claim. If the Constitutional Tribunal indeed ruled on the unconstitutionality of this discrepancy in 2014, then this part is true.

Given the specificity and the potential impact of the Constitutional Tribunal ruling, the claim hinges significantly on this part. If the ruling is accurate, the claim is largely true. If the ruling is inaccurate or misrepresented, the claim would be mostly false.

Without specific verification of the 2014 ruling and the exact benefit amounts, we can conclude that the claim is plausible but not fully verifiable.

According to data from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia, the actual percentage of high school graduates who continue to higher education is lower than 90%. As of recent years, the percentage is closer to around 50-60%.

Regarding the statement that ""masters are lacking in factories,"" while there might be specific labor market demands and shortages in certain sectors, this claim is too general to be definitively validated without specific data on the demand for masters degrees in factories in Serbia.

Cracovians live the longest in Poland.,false,pl,"To determine the validity of the claim ""Cracovians live the longest in Poland,"" we would need to examine reliable data on life expectancy across different regions in Poland. Without specific data, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we consider general trends and available statistics, we can make an educated assessment.

According to various sources, regions in Poland with higher life expectancy often correlate with better healthcare, economic conditions, and quality of life. Cities like Warsaw and Krakow (where Cracovians reside) tend to have higher life expectancies due to these factors. However, without specific data comparing Krakow to other regions, we cannot definitively say that Cracovians live the longest in Poland.

"""I am responsibly in front of the Ministry of Agriculture that this year's sunflower race will be between 300 and 320 thousand tons, which is enough for about 130,000 tons of edible oil.""",true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. The claim states that the year's sunflower harvest will be between 300,000 and 320,000 tons.
2. It also states that this harvest will yield about 130,000 tons of edible oil.

To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to consider the typical yield of edible oil from sunflower seeds. On average, sunflower seeds yield about 35-40% oil by weight.

Using the lower bound of the harvest (300,000 tons) and the lower average yield (35%), we can calculate the expected oil yield:

\[ 300,000 \text{ tons} \times 0.35 = 105,000 \text{ tons of oil} \]

Using the upper bound of the harvest (320,000 tons) and the upper average yield (40%), we can calculate the expected oil yield:

\[ 320,000 \text{ tons} \times 0.40 = 128,000 \text{ tons of oil} \]

Given these calculations, the claim that the harvest will yield about 130,000 tons of edible oil is plausible, as it falls within the range of expected oil yields.

However, without additional context or data on the specific year's conditions, it's difficult to definitively confirm the exact harvest and yield. Therefore, the claim is likely accurate but not definitively proven.

Let's break it down:

1. **Election and Term**: The European Council does elect its President by a qualified majority for a term of 2.5 years, and this term is renewable once. This part is accurate.

2. **Renewability**: The claim states that the mandate is ""renewable and, in the event of an obstacle or serious failure, the European Council may decide differently."" This is somewhat misleading. While it is true that the term is renewable once, the phrase ""in the event of an obstacle or serious failure, the European Council may decide differently"" is not explicitly stated in Article 15 and could be misinterpreted.

3. **Machinery Analogy**: The analogy to a machine is not relevant to the legal and procedural context of the European Union Treaty.

1. **Serbia will have economic growth this year as predicted by the IMF and the World Bank.**
2. **Serbia is the only country in Europe with growth.**

### Analysis:

1. **Economic Growth Prediction:**
   - The IMF and the World Bank often make economic growth predictions for various countries. If these institutions have indeed predicted growth for Serbia, this part of the claim could be true. However, without specific data or sources, it's hard to verify this part fully.

2. **Serbia as the Only Country in Europe with Growth:**
   - This claim is highly unlikely. Europe consists of many countries, and it is improbable that Serbia would be the only one experiencing economic growth. Economic growth is typically a common occurrence across multiple countries, even if the rates vary.

### Conclusion:

Given the lack of specific data to support the first part of the claim and the highly improbable nature of the second part, the overall claim leans more towards being false.

3. **""I absolutely all done by law and no conflict of interest""**: This claim asserts that all actions were legally compliant and free from conflicts of interest.

Without specific context or evidence to support or refute these claims, it's challenging to definitively label them as true or false. However, the statement is phrased in a way that suggests it aims to convey compliance with legal and ethical standards.

Serbia is generally considered a democratic country with regular elections and a relatively open society. However, it is also important to note that like many societies, Serbia does face challenges with extremist groups, including far-right organizations and other radical elements. The effectiveness of the government and societal mechanisms in curbing the influence of these groups can vary.

Given these nuances, the claim that extreme groups ""cannot pass"" in Serbia might be overstating the situation. While Serbia does have mechanisms to combat extremism, the complete absence of extremist influence is unlikely in any society.

2. **Historical Data**: Past trends can provide insight into whether pensions have generally increased in line with salary growth.
3. **Economic Policies**: Current and future economic policies can affect both pensions and salaries.

Without specific context or data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, generally speaking, pensions can be influenced by various factors such as inflation, cost-of-living adjustments, and government policies, which may not always align perfectly with salary growth.

Given the complexity and variability of these factors, a cautious evaluation would suggest that while pensions might generally increase, they may not always do so in perfect alignment with salary growth.

In recent years, the percentage of practicing Catholics has been declining, but it remains high. Specific data for Poznan might vary slightly from national averages.

Without precise data for Poznan, we can infer that while a majority of Poznanians might be Catholic, the exact figure of 80% being ""believing Catholics"" (which could imply active practice) is likely an overestimate based on recent trends and available national data.

Without specifying the exact country making the claim, it is challenging to definitively say whether the statement is true or not. However, based on general knowledge, it is unlikely that any single country outspends all others by a significant margin in terms of social spending percentage.

213 professions are prohibited for women in Kazakhstan,mostly true,ru,"As of my last update in October 2023, there isn't specific, publicly available information confirming that 213 professions are prohibited for women in Kazakhstan. However, it is known that Kazakhstan has had restrictions on certain professions for women, similar to some other countries, often related to jobs deemed physically demanding or hazardous.

Given the lack of specific data confirming the exact number of 213 professions, the claim cannot be verified as entirely accurate without further evidence. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim would be best categorized as ""Half True"" due to the existence of restrictions but the lack of confirmation on the exact number.

1. **State Investments**: The claim mentions that huge state investments are planned for the construction of wholesale and distribution centers. Without specific figures or sources, it's difficult to verify the scale of these investments.

2. **Timeline**: The claim states that these centers are planned to be operational by the end of 2022. Given that the statement doesn't provide a specific date or current year, we can't accurately assess the feasibility of this timeline without additional context.

3. **Effectiveness**: The claim acknowledges that the effect will not be quick, which is a reasonable assertion for large infrastructure projects. However, it also raises questions about the effectiveness, which suggests some skepticism or uncertainty.

Without more specific details or sources to verify the scale of investments, the timeline, and the effectiveness, the claim can be considered partially accurate but lacking in concrete evidence.

No medical intervention, including vaccines, can be guaranteed to be absolutely safe for every individual in every circumstance. Vaccines, like any other medication or treatment, can have side effects, and there is always a small risk of adverse reactions. However, it's important to note that vaccines undergo rigorous testing and are generally considered safe and effective for the vast majority of people.

"""Serbia came out of the recession, because the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of this year was one percent higher than in the same period 2009.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider what defines a recession and whether a single quarter of GDP growth can indicate an exit from a recession.

Recession is typically defined as a period of general economic decline and is often identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters. If Serbia had a positive GDP growth of one percent in the first quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2009, it suggests economic improvement. However, coming out of a recession usually requires sustained growth over a longer period to confirm a trend.

Without additional context on the economic conditions in the preceding quarters or a more extended period of growth, a single quarter of positive GDP growth may not conclusively indicate that Serbia has ""come out of the recession.""

"""I am innocent and statements of all the accused speak in favor of that.""",true,sr,"To evaluate the claim ""I am innocent and statements of all the accused speak in favor of that,"" we need to consider two main points:

1. The speaker's self-proclaimed innocence.
2. The consistency of the statements from all the accused individuals.

Without specific evidence or additional context, it's challenging to definitively determine the truth value of the claim. However, we can analyze the likelihood of its truthfulness:

- **Self-proclaimed innocence**: This is a subjective claim and cannot be objectively verified without further evidence.
- **Statements of all the accused**: If all the accused individuals indeed speak in favor of the speaker's innocence, it adds some credibility to the claim. However, this does not necessarily prove innocence, as statements can be coordinated or false.

Given the lack of objective evidence and the reliance on subjective claims and potentially coordinated statements, the most accurate assessment would be:

The claim suggests that the speaker's country offers more generous maternity rights because one can return to work after three months, whereas in Germany, one must work for three months before taking maternity leave.

Here's a breakdown of maternity rights in Germany:
- Maternity leave (Mutterschutz) in Germany is six weeks before and eight weeks after childbirth, with full pay.
- Parental leave (Elternzeit) can be taken for up to three years, with partial pay for the first 12 to 14 months.
- There is no requirement to work for a specific duration before becoming eligible for maternity leave.

Without knowing the specific country the speaker is referring to, we can't definitively say whether the maternity rights are larger or better. However, the claim that you must work for three months in Germany before taking maternity leave is inaccurate.

Without specific information about the source, year, and methods used to compile this data, it is challenging to verify its accuracy definitively. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that the claim is based on a credible report or official statistics from a reliable organization.

If the claim is backed by a credible source and the data is consistent with other reports or statistics on the same topic, it can be considered mostly accurate. However, without direct verification, we cannot state it is fully true.

We have already increased our debt over 10 percent (during the Covid-19 pandemic-note Demagog),true,pl,"To evaluate the claim ""We have already increased our debt over 10 percent (during the Covid-19 pandemic),"" we need to consider the context and available data. The claim is about a specific increase in debt, likely referring to a country's national debt.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, many countries indeed saw significant increases in their national debt due to economic stimulus packages, reduced tax revenues, and increased government spending on healthcare and social support. While the exact percentage increase can vary by country, it is plausible that some countries experienced an increase in debt of over 10 percent.

Without specific data for a particular country, we can consider general trends. For example, in the United States, the national debt increased substantially during the pandemic, with some estimates showing increases well over 10 percent. Similar trends were seen in other countries as they responded to the economic and health crises.

Therefore, the claim is likely accurate for many countries, although it would need specific data to confirm for a particular country.

1. **Budgets Made with Overrated Revenues**: The claim states that budgets were made with revenues overrated by 46.4 percent.
2. **Impossible Obligations**: The claim suggests that based on these overrated revenues, impossible obligations were set, reaching up to 50 million euros.

Without specific data or evidence to verify these exact figures and practices, we can only assess the plausibility and reasonableness of the claim.

- **Overrated Revenues**: It is plausible that budgets could be made with overly optimistic revenue projections, but the specific figure of 46.4 percent overvaluation is a strong and precise claim that would require supporting evidence.
- **Impossible Obligations**: Setting obligations based on overrated revenues could lead to financial strain, but the claim that these obligations always reach 50 million euros is again a specific and strong assertion that needs verification.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support the precise figures mentioned (46.4 percent overvaluation and 50 million euros in obligations), the claim appears to be a mix of plausible general practices and unverified specific details.

2. **Jurisdiction of the Ministry**: The claim that the Ministry should have jurisdiction to issue a portion of the licenses, similar to Hungary, requires verification. Without specific evidence or data about the Hungarian model and its effectiveness, this part of the claim is harder to validate.

However, without specific information about the country or the exact legislation, it is challenging to confirm its accuracy. Generally, claims about unique legislative practices often need to be backed by substantial evidence, and the absence of such evidence can make the claim difficult to verify.

The claim suggests that the opposition held significant influence in the last term by chairing about half of the committees and being involved in important ones. However, the statement also mentions that the opposition was ""exhausted"" by these important committees, which could imply that they were overburdened or had their resources stretched thin.

Without additional context or data to verify the exact distribution of committee chairs and the extent of the opposition's involvement, it is difficult to definitively say whether the claim is entirely true or false. The use of the term ""exhausted"" adds a layer of ambiguity, as it could be interpreted in multiple ways.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can outline the steps you would take to verify this claim:

1. **Collect Data**: Gather trade deficit data for the country in question from reliable sources such as Eurostat, national statistical offices, or international trade databases.
2. **Compare Figures**: Compare the trade deficit figures for 2012 with the most recent data available.
3. **Analyze Trends**: Look at the trend over the years to see if there has been a consistent reduction leading to a halving of the deficit.

If the data shows that the trade deficit has indeed been reduced by approximately 50% from 2012 to the present, the claim would be considered true. If the reduction is significant but not exactly 50%, it might be considered 'Mostly True'. If the reduction is less significant or inconsistent, it might be 'Half True'. If there is little to no reduction, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

1. Serbia being declared the leader of Southeast Europe in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).
2. Serbia receiving an FDI inflow of $2.56 billion, which is more than any other country in the region.

Without specific data or a timeframe, it's challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, we can analyze the plausibility based on general economic trends and available data.

1. **Leader in FDI:** Serbia has indeed been recognized for its efforts in attracting FDI, but whether it is consistently declared the leader depends on the specific year and source of the declaration.

2. **FDI Inflow:** The amount of $2.56 billion is significant, but without comparing it to other countries in the region during the same period, it's hard to confirm if it is the highest.

Generally, labor inspection agencies have the authority to conduct unannounced inspections to ensure compliance with labor laws and regulations. However, specific requirements can vary by country and jurisdiction.

If the jurisdiction in question mandates that the National Labor Inspectorate must announce every control, then the claim would be 'True'. However, if the jurisdiction allows for unannounced inspections, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the general practices of labor inspection agencies and without specific jurisdictional information, it is more likely that unannounced inspections are permissible. Therefore, the claim that the National Labor Inspectorate must announce every control is likely 'False'.

In many countries, the rights of LGBT individuals are indeed protected by law and the constitution, ensuring that they have the opportunity to exercise their rights without limitation. However, the reality can be more nuanced:

1. **Legal Protections**: Many countries have laws that protect LGBT individuals from discrimination and guarantee their rights. For example, in some countries, same-sex marriage is legal, anti-discrimination laws are in place, and there are protections against hate crimes.

2. **Constitutional Guarantees**: Some constitutions explicitly protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, while others do not.

3. **Practical Implementation**: Even in places where legal protections exist, there can be practical limitations due to societal attitudes, lack of enforcement, or discriminatory practices.

Given these considerations, the claim is generally true in many contexts but not universally applicable or perfectly implemented everywhere. Therefore, the most accurate categorization would be:

"""In the first five months, we had a deficit of 25 billion dinars instead of planned 90 billion, which is three and a half times less than what the IMF would be satisfied.""",mostly true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the statement logically and mathematically.

The claim states that the deficit was 25 billion dinars instead of the planned 90 billion dinars, and that this amount is three and a half times less than what the IMF would be satisfied with.

First, let's determine what ""three and a half times less"" means mathematically. If the deficit is three and a half times less than a certain amount, we divide that amount by 3.5 to find the deficit.

Let's denote the amount the IMF would be satisfied with as \( X \).

According to the claim:
\[ \frac{X}{3.5} = 25 \text{ billion dinars} \]

Solving for \( X \):
\[ X = 25 \times 3.5 \]
\[ X = 87.5 \text{ billion dinars} \]

The claim suggests that the IMF would be satisfied with a deficit of 87.5 billion dinars, which is very close to the planned deficit of 90 billion dinars. Given the context, a small discrepancy like this (2.5 billion dinars) can be considered within a reasonable margin of error or approximation.

Therefore, the claim that the actual deficit is three and a half times less than what the IMF would be satisfied with is mostly accurate.

3. **Decline in Gross Social Product**: The claim mentions a decline in gross social product. This term is not commonly used in economic reporting; it might be a misinterpretation or a typo for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or Gross National Product (GNP).

"""Serbia will achieve a surplus higher than a billion euros in the foreign trade of agricultural products this (2010), which is the best result in its history""",half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify whether Serbia indeed achieved a surplus higher than a billion euros in the foreign trade of agricultural products in 2010, and if this was the best result in its history at that time.

Without access to specific data for 2010, I can provide a general approach to verifying this claim:

1. **Check Official Trade Statistics**: Look at official reports from Serbia's statistical agencies or government bodies responsible for trade data.
2. **Compare with Historical Data**: Ensure that the surplus claimed for 2010 is the highest compared to previous years.
3. **Cross-Reference with International Sources**: Validate the data with international organizations that track trade statistics, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

Given the lack of specific data in this conversation, a hypothetical assessment would be:

- If official statistics confirm a surplus higher than a billion euros and it was the highest recorded, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the surplus was close to a billion euros but not necessarily the highest historically, it might be 'Mostly True'.
- If the surplus was significantly less or not the highest, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

1. **Feminization of the teaching profession**: The claim states that 81% of all working teachers are women and only 19% are men. This aligns with many studies that show a significant majority of teachers are women.

2. **Number of male teachers**: The claim mentions there are only 60,000 male teachers. Without a specific context (like a country or region), it's hard to verify this number. However, the overall point is that male teachers are a minority.

3. **Roles of male teachers**: The claim suggests that many male teachers are directors, hard workers, or physical education teachers. This is a generalization, but it's not entirely inaccurate, as men do often take on these roles in schools.

While the claim makes some generalizations and lacks specific context, the overall point—that teaching is a feminized profession with most teachers being women and a minority being men—is largely accurate.

2. **Co-financing**: The Legia stadium project did receive co-financing from urban funds.
3. **Amount**: The specific amount of co-financing mentioned is half a billion zlotys.

Based on available information, the claim that the Legia stadium was constructed by a private company (ITI) and was co-financed with urban funds amounting to half a billion zlotys is generally accurate. However, without specific documentation verifying the exact amount, we can conservatively rate the claim as mostly true.

Organizations like Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Freedom House provide annual rankings on press freedom. While it's true that media freedom varies among EU countries, the statement suggests that there are EU countries with ten times less freedom than a certain unnamed country, which is a strong and specific claim.

Without a specific country mentioned for comparison, it's challenging to pinpoint the accuracy. However, based on available data, while there are differences in media freedom among EU countries, the variance is not typically as extreme as ""ten times less."" For instance, according to RSF's 2023 World Press Freedom Index, the lowest-ranked EU country is Bulgaria at 91st, while the highest is Finland at 4th. This disparity does not equate to a tenfold difference in terms of media freedom metrics.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **""So where are you critics now who told the fountain overflows. So every fountain in the world overflowed, has a compensation pool and pumps that return water.""**
   - This part of the claim suggests that critics who complained about a fountain overflowing are misinformed because all fountains have mechanisms to handle overflow. While it's true that many fountains have such mechanisms, it's not accurate to say that every fountain in the world does.

2. **""Let them go to Madrid to look like the fountains there.""**
   - This is a subjective statement and doesn't add factual information to the claim.

3. **""They were against Dimitrije Tucovic prone, and they don't even know who he is, so now they're bothered by a fountain, so mast.""**
   - This part of the claim is vague and subjective. It's unclear who ""they"" are and what their stance on Dimitrije Tucovic is. The phrase ""so mast"" is also unclear in this context.

The share of new private organizations from the total number of open 93%,true,ru,"To evaluate the claim ""The share of new private organizations from the total number of open 93%,"" we need to consider the plausibility and context of the statement.

Generally, the share of new private organizations compared to the total number of open businesses can vary significantly depending on the region, economic conditions, and the specific time frame considered. A claim that 93% of all open businesses are new private organizations seems unusually high. Typically, the economy includes a mix of new and established businesses, public and private entities, and various forms of ownership.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to assert the claim as entirely true. Therefore, the claim is likely overstated and not representative of typical economic conditions.

As of my last update in October 2023, Serbia has made progress in reducing poverty, but it is important to assess whether the claim of ""almost eradicated"" extreme poverty and a reduced risk rate of poverty is accurate.

According to various reports, including those from the World Bank and the European Union, Serbia has indeed made strides in poverty reduction. However, the complete eradication of extreme poverty is a significant claim that requires substantial evidence. While poverty rates have been declining, complete eradication of extreme poverty is a challenging goal that few countries have achieved.

Given the available information, it is more accurate to say that Serbia has made progress in reducing poverty, but claiming that extreme forms of poverty have been ""almost eradicated"" might be an overstatement. The risk rate of poverty has likely been reduced, but the extent of this reduction needs to be considered in the context of the overall economic and social conditions in Serbia.

3. **""That seal doesn't exist anymore.""**

Without additional context or evidence, it's challenging to verify the truthfulness of these individual statements. However, based on the claim's structure and the assertions made, we can assess its plausibility:

- The claim implies a lack of documentation and knowledge about a specific seal.
- It also suggests that the seal no longer exists.
- The claimant seems to question the basis for any legal action related to the seal.

Given the lack of specific details or evidence to support or refute these statements, the claim falls into a category where its truthfulness is uncertain.

Without specific data or official sources to verify the exact salaries, we can only make an educated guess based on general knowledge about executive compensation in similar roles and organizations.

1. **President's Salary:** A salary of 25,000 zlotys for a high-level executive position, such as the president of a major utility company, is not uncommon. It is within the range of what might be expected for such a role.

2. **Total Management Costs:** The claim that the entire management board costs over a hundred thousand zlotys every month is less specific but still plausible, considering the number of high-level positions and their respective salaries.

According to various economic indicators, Serbia's GDP and financial reserves are significantly lower than this amount. For instance, Serbia's GDP is typically in the range of tens of billions of euros, not hundreds.

Given the context, while the exact figure of 200 billion euros for the total property of citizens is difficult to verify without specific data, the claim that Serbia does not have 200 billion euros is more straightforward.

However, the suggestion to increase the tax-free amount to 30,000 PLN (which is approximately 6,500 EUR as of my last update) would indeed mean that an income of up to PLN 4,000 a month (approximately 870 EUR) would not be taxed.

Given the lack of data to confirm the first part of the claim, the most accurate assessment would be:

We won one hundred thousand voters in the first election (...) in the second we doubled this result.We would like Marian Kowalski to expand our group of voters again.,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. The party won 100,000 voters in the first election.
2. In the second election, they doubled this result, which means they won 200,000 voters.
3. They want Marian Kowalski to expand their group of voters again.

The claim doesn't specify by how much Marian Kowalski should expand the voter base, so the third point is a goal, not a verifiable fact. The verifiable parts of the claim are the number of voters won in the first and second elections.

Assuming the numbers for the first and second elections are accurate, the claim is mostly true, as the goal for Marian Kowalski is not a fact that can be proven true or false.

Full ZUS contributions from the state budget are at rest.,half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim 'Full ZUS contributions from the state budget are at rest,' we need to consider the context and available information about ZUS (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych) contributions in Poland.

ZUS contributions can include various types of payments such as retirement, disability, sickness, and health insurance. The claim suggests that the state budget fully covers these contributions, implying no additional payments are required from individuals or employers.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively confirm or deny this claim. However, typically, ZUS contributions are shared among employees, employers, and the state, with the state covering only a portion of the contributions for specific groups like the unemployed or those on maternity leave.

Given the general structure of ZUS contributions, it is unlikely that the state budget fully covers all ZUS contributions across the board.

Without this specific data, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that the data provided is based on official sources and is accurate. The increase in tax revenues by PLN 17.9 billion compared to the previous year would then be a factual statement.

"Our current is convincingly cheapest in Europe, 30 percent is cheaper than countries that have the cheapest current in the region.",mostly true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Comparison Basis**: The claim states that the current (electricity) is 30 percent cheaper than countries with the cheapest current in the region. This implies a comparison with the lowest prices in Europe.

2. **Specificity**: The claim does not specify which countries are being compared or provide specific data points to support the 30 percent cheaper assertion.

3. **Verifiability**: Without concrete data or references to authoritative sources, it is challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim.

Given these points, the claim lacks specificity and verifiability, making it difficult to assert its truthfulness without additional information. Therefore, the claim is not entirely false but cannot be fully substantiated as true either.

Foreigners will extend the terms of stay in Kazakhstan in connection with coronavirus,true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Foreigners will extend the terms of stay in Kazakhstan in connection with coronavirus,"" we need to check if Kazakhstan has implemented policies to allow foreigners to extend their stay due to the coronavirus pandemic.

As of my last update in October 2023, many countries, including Kazakhstan, have implemented measures to extend the stay of foreigners due to travel restrictions and safety concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic. These measures often include allowing visa extensions or temporary residence permits to help foreigners who cannot return to their home countries.

Since this is a general practice observed in many countries during the pandemic, it is likely that Kazakhstan has implemented similar measures. Therefore, the claim is likely true or mostly true.

""",half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **""The Order of St. Aleksandar Nevski, who received Neway and other greats, stopped being awarded in 1917.""**
   - This part of the claim is historically accurate. The Order of St. Alexander Nevsky was indeed a prestigious award in Imperial Russia until the Russian Revolution in 1917.

2. **""Order of Aleksandar Nevski, who received (President) Aleksandar Vučić, is worthy of attention, but it does not have the same weight.""**
   - This suggests that there is a current Order of Aleksandar Nevski, but it is not as prestigious as the historical one. This part is subjective but generally accurate if we consider that new orders might not carry the same historical significance.

3. **""Bogoljub Karic also got him two years ago. I use the opportunity to congratulate both of them.""**
   - This part claims that Bogoljub Karic also received the Order of Aleksandar Nevski two years ago. Without specific evidence, this part is harder to verify, but it does not inherently contradict known facts.

Given these points, the claim mixes historical facts with a subjective evaluation and a specific recent event. The historical part is accurate, the subjective part is reasonable, and the specific recent event is not verified but plausible.

"The MP said that the sum of funds accumulated on the reserve [general state budget] somehow increased cosmically.It increased by about 15% -20% (...) compared to last year.Today, this sum is about PLN 250 million.",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim made by the MP, we need to consider the following points:

1. The MP stated that the sum of funds accumulated on the reserve increased by about 15%-20% compared to last year.
2. The current sum is about PLN 250 million.

To verify this claim, we would need to compare the current sum of PLN 250 million with the sum from the previous year. If the increase is indeed within the range of 15%-20%, the claim would be accurate.

Let's assume the previous year's sum was \( X \) million PLN. The increase to PLN 250 million would be calculated as follows:

\[ 1.15X \leq 250 \leq 1.20X \]

Solving for \( X \):

\[ \frac{250}{1.20} \leq X \leq \frac{250}{1.15} \]

\[ 208.33 \leq X \leq 217.39 \]

This means the previous year's sum should be between approximately PLN 208.33 million and PLN 217.39 million for the claim to be true.

Without the exact figures from the previous year, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the MP's statement. However, if the previous year's sum falls within the calculated range, the claim would be considered true.

**Final Answer:** Without the exact figures from the previous year, the claim is 'Half True'.",,False,True
"""Inflation will be about 12 percent in Serbia by the end of the year (2012).""",true,sr,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we would need to verify the actual inflation rate in Serbia for the year 2012. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I do not have real-time access to databases or the ability to perform live internet searches. However, I can provide a method for you to verify this claim.

You can check the inflation rate for Serbia in 2012 by consulting reliable economic data sources such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), or the Serbian Statistical Office. These organizations typically provide historical inflation data.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume the actual inflation rate in Serbia for 2012 was significantly different from 12 percent. If the actual rate was, for example, around 7 percent, the claim would be inaccurate.

The problem is that all cases are appealed in court.(...) The court was to comment on these matters in June.Only Patryk Jaki questioned all judicial compositions.,half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its constituent parts and assess the truthfulness of each component.

1. **""All cases are appealed in court.""**
   - This statement is quite broad and general. It is unlikely that ""all"" cases are appealed in court, as not every legal decision is challenged.

2. **""The court was to comment on these matters in June.""**
   - This statement is specific but lacks context. Without knowing the specific cases or the court in question, it is difficult to verify.

3. **""Only Patryk Jaki questioned all judicial compositions.""**
   - This statement suggests that Patryk Jaki is the sole individual who has questioned the judicial compositions. This is a bold claim and would require specific evidence to be verified.

Given the lack of specificity and the broad nature of the claims, it is challenging to verify their accuracy without additional context. However, based on the general nature of the statements and the improbability of ""all"" cases being appealed, the claim as a whole leans towards being inaccurate.

Without specific data, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on typical defense spending patterns among NATO countries, it is plausible that a country could be in such a position.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact rank and proportion, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' if the general trend aligns with known defense spending patterns among NATO countries. However, without concrete data, a precise evaluation cannot be made.

"180 million on the Internet and equipment for students and teachers are funds from the current POPC, which we decided to spend in consultation with the EC for a new goal.The EU did not transfer any new funds, even € 1 to fight Covid-19 in pl.",half true,pl,"To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to analyze the statement:

1. **""180 million on the Internet and equipment for students and teachers are funds from the current POPC...""**
   - This suggests that the funds are being reallocated from an existing budget (POPC).

2. **""...which we decided to spend in consultation with the EC for a new goal.""**
   - This indicates that the decision to reallocate these funds was made in consultation with the European Commission (EC).

3. **""The EU did not transfer any new funds, even € 1 to fight Covid-19 in pl.""**
   - This claims that no additional funds were transferred from the EU specifically to combat Covid-19 in Poland.

The critical point is whether the funds mentioned are indeed from an existing budget (POPC) and whether the EU did not provide any new funds for Covid-19 efforts in Poland.

Without specific external verification sources, we can analyze the logical consistency and typical procedures:

- **Reallocation of existing funds:** This is a common practice, especially during emergencies like the Covid-19 pandemic.
- **Consultation with the EC:** This is plausible as such decisions often involve consultation with relevant authorities.
- **Lack of new funds from the EU:** This is a specific claim that would require fact-checking against official EU funding announcements and records.

Given the context and typical procedures, the claim appears logically consistent but would require verification from official sources to confirm the lack of new EU funds specifically for Covid-19 in Poland.

**Final Answer: Half True**

However, based on general knowledge and typical media environments in democratic societies, it is highly unusual for a single private TV station to have exclusive rights to support government work.

Therefore, without additional specific context, the claim that ""There is only one private TV that supports government work. It's Pink and they have all the rights to it."" seems unlikely to be true in most scenarios.

The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) was in power in Poland from 2001 to 2005. During this period, various privatization efforts were undertaken across different sectors. The privatization of the heat and power plant in Łódź did occur during the SLD's tenure. However, the specific details of the privatization process, including the extent of SLD's direct involvement and the outcomes, would need to be examined to determine the accuracy of the claim.

Given the general accuracy of the timing and the party in power, the claim can be considered mostly true, acknowledging that the SLD was indeed the governing party during the period mentioned and privatization was a part of their policies.

The frequent errors of Zoom may pose a threat to Kazakhstan,half true,ru,"To evaluate the claim ""The frequent errors of Zoom may pose a threat to Kazakhstan,"" we need to consider several factors: the severity and frequency of Zoom errors, their impact on users, and the specific context of Kazakhstan.

1. **Frequency of Zoom Errors**: Zoom, like any software, can have occasional errors, but it is generally regarded as a reliable platform for video conferencing.

2. **Impact of Errors**: Errors can range from minor inconveniences to more significant issues such as security vulnerabilities or service outages. However, most errors are typically addressed quickly by the company.

3. **Threat to Kazakhstan**: For Zoom errors to pose a specific threat to Kazakhstan, they would need to significantly impact critical infrastructure, national security, or other vital areas. There is no evidence suggesting that Zoom errors are uniquely threatening to Kazakhstan.

Given these considerations, the claim that frequent errors of Zoom may pose a threat to Kazakhstan is not supported by substantial evidence and overstates the impact of Zoom errors.

1. **Serbia respects the territorial integrity of each member of the UN, including Ukraine**: This statement is generally true, as Serbia has publicly stated its support for Ukraine's territorial integrity.

2. **Serbia cannot introduce sanctions to Russia, because Russia never introduced sanctions to Serbia**: This is a more complex statement. It is true that Serbia has not imposed sanctions on Russia and that Russia has not imposed sanctions on Serbia. However, the reasoning that Serbia ""cannot"" introduce sanctions is somewhat misleading, as it implies a lack of ability rather than a political choice.

Considering these points, the claim is partially accurate but also includes a misleading element. Therefore, the claim can be classified as 'Half True'.

1. Whether the years 2002 or 2003 had the lowest fertility rates in Poland.
2. Whether the SLD government reduced parental leave from 18 to 16 weeks during that time.

Let's address these points:

1. **Fertility Rates in 2002-2003**: According to statistical data, the fertility rates in Poland were indeed very low around 2002-2003. For example, the total fertility rate in 2003 was 1.23, which is among the lowest recorded.

2. **Reduction of Parental Leave**: In 2003, the SLD (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej) government did implement changes to the parental leave policy. Specifically, they reduced the duration of parental leave from 18 to 16 weeks.

Given these points, the claim is accurate in stating that the SLD government reduced parental leave during a period of very low fertility rates.

"""Serbia is currently the most desirable location for new investments in the entire middle and Eastern Europe.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim that ""Serbia is currently the most desirable location for new investments in the entire middle and Eastern Europe,"" we need to consider various factors such as economic indicators, business environment, government policies, and comparisons with other countries in the region.

**Factors to Consider:**

1. **Economic Indicators:** Economic growth, GDP per capita, and other financial metrics can indicate the attractiveness of a country for investment.

2. **Business Environment:** Ease of doing business, regulatory environment, and infrastructure are crucial factors.

3. **Government Policies:** Incentives, tax policies, and support for foreign investments can significantly impact a country's attractiveness.

4. **Regional Comparison:** Comparing Serbia with other countries in the region like Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and others is essential to validate the claim.

**Evaluation:**

- Serbia has made significant strides in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and has implemented various reforms to improve its business environment. However, countries like Poland and the Czech Republic consistently rank higher in terms of FDI inflows and overall economic stability.

- According to various reports and indices, such as the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings, Serbia has shown improvement but still lags behind some of its regional peers.

- Serbia offers attractive incentives for investments, but the overall business environment and economic stability might not yet be at the level of some other countries in the region.

**Conclusion:**

While Serbia is indeed an attractive location for investments and has made notable progress, claiming it is the ""most desirable"" location in the entire middle and Eastern Europe is an overstatement. Other countries in the region also offer competitive advantages and have historically been more attractive to investors.

1. **Capacity Increase**: Verifying a 50% increase in prison capacities would require specific data from official sources such as government reports, prison administration records, or independent audits.

2. **Improved Conditions**: Assessing whether conditions have improved to align with European standards would involve examining reports from human rights organizations, prison inspections, and potentially testimonies from prisoners or staff.

Given the lack of specific data available to us, we can only speculate based on typical patterns. If the claim aligns with general trends in prison reform efforts but lacks precise verification, it might be considered 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If there is significant evidence to the contrary or the claim is unsupported by any reliable data, it could be considered 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

   - **Wrocław:** Has also taken steps to combat smog, but perhaps not as aggressively or comprehensively as Krakow.

2. **Current Problem Comparability:**
   - Both cities face significant smog issues, particularly during the winter months.

"""Over the past year, food prices have risen by 10%""",true,ru,"To evaluate the claim ""Over the past year, food prices have risen by 10%,"" we would need to refer to reliable data sources such as government statistics or reports from international economic organizations. As of my last update in October 2023, specific data on food price increases can vary by region and country. However, general trends and economic reports from organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), or national statistical agencies can provide accurate insights.

Without specific data for the past year, it is challenging to definitively state the accuracy of the claim. However, recent reports have indicated significant increases in food prices globally, often due to factors such as supply chain disruptions, climate change, and geopolitical issues.

Given the general trend of rising food prices, the claim might be considered 'Mostly True' if supported by recent data showing increases around 10%. However, without specific data, a precise evaluation cannot be made.

"Last year, we beat records, 330 million passengers who used the Polish railway.",half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim that ""Last year, we beat records, 330 million passengers who used the Polish railway,"" we would need to verify the official data on passenger numbers from the Polish railway system for the specified year. Without access to that specific data, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to reliable sources that provide the following information:

- Polish railway passenger numbers have been steadily increasing over the years.
- The previous record for passenger numbers was around 300 million.
- The latest data for the specified year shows that just over 320 million passengers used the Polish railway.

Given this hypothetical data, the claim of 330 million passengers would be an overestimation, but it is close to the actual number and reflects a record-breaking year. Therefore, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but not entirely true.

- **Measles, Rubella, and Mumps**: Contracting these diseases typically results in lifelong immunity.
- **Whooping Cough (Pertussis)**: Immunity after infection is not lifelong and can wane over time, making reinfection possible, especially in adulthood.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely true for all the diseases mentioned.

This can vary widely depending on the jurisdiction, the type of court, and the workload distribution.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide an exact assessment. However, generally, judges in many jurisdictions handle a significantly higher number of cases per year. For example, in some U.S. courts, judges may handle hundreds of cases annually.

Therefore, based on general knowledge of judicial workloads, the claim that judges deal with only 6 cases a year is likely inaccurate.

However, based on the general assertion that there is greater transparency thanks to the IMF and fiscal advice, and that the speaker is often angry with Sabic and unhappy with Jankovic, the claim seems to mix objective and subjective elements. Without more context or specific data to support the claims about transparency and the speaker's emotions, it is challenging to classify this statement as entirely true or false.

The claim suggests that Donald Tusk, the head of the Civic Platform, promised directly to the camera that his party would not raise the retirement age. To verify this, we would need to check historical records, speeches, and campaign materials from 2011.

However, without direct access to these materials, we can rely on general knowledge and historical context. It is known that political promises are often subject to change based on circumstances, and the retirement age has been a contentious issue in many countries, including Poland.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support or refute the claim in this context, the most accurate assessment would be to consider it ""Half True."" This means that while Tusk might have made such a promise, the reality of political decisions can often diverge from campaign promises due to various factors.

1. **""We've had those protests already, there are everywhere, especially in African countries.""** This is vague and hard to verify without specific context, but protests indeed happen everywhere, including African countries.

2. **""In many countries, Europe is prohibited, in Germany, you have no unions in the military and police.""** This is false. In Germany, police officers have the right to form unions, such as the Gewerkschaft der Polizei (GdP). Military personnel in Germany, however, do not have the same union rights as police officers, but they have representation through the BundeswehrVerband.

3. **""With us you have, we are a democratic country. You do not have those countries.""** This is vague and the truth depends on the interpretation of ""us"" and ""those countries.""

It was Prime Minister Morawiecki who announced (before the election note) that there is no more Covid.,true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the context and actual statements made by Prime Minister Morawiecki regarding COVID-19. Without specific quotes or context, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, it's unlikely that a prime minister would declare that COVID-19 no longer exists, especially given the ongoing global health situation.

If Prime Minister Morawiecki made a statement that could be interpreted as suggesting COVID-19 was no longer a concern, it would likely be taken out of context or exaggerated. Typically, political figures might discuss reductions in cases, successful vaccination campaigns, or lifting of restrictions, but not the complete disappearance of the virus.

Given the absence of specific evidence, the claim that Morawiecki announced there is no more COVID seems exaggerated or misleading.

"""The airport was not worth 35 years 100, 120 million.It's worth 500 million today. """,false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need more context and data about the airport in question. Specifically, we need to know the airport's initial cost, the time frame over which the value increased, and the current market valuation or assessment that supports the claim that it is now worth 500 million. Without this information, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.

However, based on the information provided:

1. The claim states that the airport was initially valued at 35 years (which seems nonsensical unless it refers to a lease or operational period) and an initial cost or investment of 100-120 million.
2. The claim asserts that the airport is now worth 500 million.

Given the lack of clarity and specifics, the claim cannot be fully verified. It seems to mix different types of values (time and monetary) without clear context.

The claim that ""we do not have any help of the Government of the Republic of Serbia"" and that ""Serbia operates in the market"" could mean different things depending on the context and the specific type of help or market operations being referred to.

Without additional information or a clear context, it is challenging to accurately assess the veracity of this statement. However, based on the information given, the claim can be considered:

1. **Largest European Manufacturer**: This part of the claim can be verified through market data, production statistics, and comparisons with other European manufacturers.

2. **Best European Manufacturer**: This is more subjective and depends on various criteria such as quality, innovation, customer satisfaction, and market reputation.

Without specific data or context, it's difficult to definitively say whether the claim is entirely true or false. However, given the subjective nature of ""best,"" it's likely that this part of the claim is not universally accepted, even if the company is the largest.

However, without specific data to verify this exact figure, we can only provide a general assessment based on known trends and data from reputable sources. For instance, organizations like the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence in the United States often report that millions of people experience domestic violence each year, which far exceeds 100,000.

Given the typical scale of domestic violence incidents reported globally, the claim that the number reaches only 100,000 annually is likely an underestimation.

4. **This year, for the first time in history, Ankara's addiction on the supply of Russian raw material has fallen below 50 percent.**

Without specific data or sources provided, it's challenging to definitively verify the accuracy of these statements. However, based on the information given, we can make some logical deductions:

- **20 years ago, it was nearly 100 percent.** This suggests that Ankara was almost entirely dependent on Russian raw materials 20 years ago.
- **Last year, there was 55 percent.** This indicates a significant reduction in dependence from nearly 100 percent to 55 percent over the past 20 years.
- **Now there is even less.** This implies that the current dependence is less than 55 percent.
- **This year, for the first time in history, Ankara's addiction on the supply of Russian raw material has fallen below 50 percent.** This statement is consistent with the previous points, suggesting a further reduction to below 50 percent this year.

Given the consistency and logical progression of the statements, the claim appears plausible. However, without verifiable data or sources, we cannot confirm it as entirely true. Therefore, the claim is likely ""Mostly True"" based on the information provided.

1. **Government Priority and Innovative Economy**: The claim states that electromobility was supposed to be a priority for the government and a driver for the innovative economy. This is a subjective statement and difficult to verify without specific policy documents or official statements.

2. **Number of Electric Cars**: The claim mentions that there are ""less than 1 thousand rides in Poland"" and that ""half of them driving 2 years ago."" This suggests that there are fewer than 1,000 electric cars currently in use in Poland, with around 500 of them having been in use two years ago.

Without access to current and reliable data on the number of electric cars in Poland, it is challenging to confirm the exact numbers. However, the claim does provide specific figures, which can be checked against available statistics.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact numbers, but considering the plausibility of the figures provided, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not entirely verifiable.

The judge from Ireland gave two examples in the justification why she made such a decision: one example because judges in Poland are allegedly chosen by politicians and the other because there is a different retirement age in Poland.,half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to examine the two examples provided by the judge from Ireland regarding the justification of her decision:

1. **Judges in Poland are allegedly chosen by politicians:**
   - This claim refers to concerns about the political influence over the judicial appointments in Poland. There have been significant debates and criticisms regarding reforms introduced by the Polish government, which some argue have increased political control over the judiciary.

2. **There is a different retirement age in Poland:**
   - This claim likely refers to changes in the retirement age for judges in Poland, which have been a point of contention. Changes to the retirement age have been seen by some as a way to remove certain judges from their positions, potentially affecting the independence of the judiciary.

Given these points, the judge's examples do reflect real concerns and issues that have been raised about the Polish judicial system. Therefore, the claim that the judge from Ireland gave these two examples in her justification is accurate.

1. **""If the Democratic Party beats on May 11, Serbia will lose Kosovo and Metohija, Raška Oblast and Vojvodina""**: This is a highly speculative claim that suggests a direct and immediate consequence of the Democratic Party winning an election. Political outcomes are complex and multifaceted, and predicting such specific and dramatic territorial losses based solely on an election result is not supported by evidence.

2. **""Serbia continue agony in the European Union and the promised allegedly better life""**: This part of the claim suggests that Serbia will continue to face difficulties within the EU and that promised improvements will not materialize. While it is true that Serbia’s integration with the EU has been challenging and progress has been slow, this claim oversimplifies a complex political and economic situation.

Given the lack of evidence for the first part and the oversimplification of the second part, the overall claim is not supported by facts and is more of a political rhetoric than a factual statement.

1. The citizens of Serbia know about the prosecutors' choice.
2. The prosecutors chose people from the regime to which Dragan Djilas belonged.
3. This happened in 2009 or 2010.

Without specific evidence or context provided, it's challenging to definitively verify each part of this claim. However, let's analyze it based on general knowledge and common sense:

1. **The citizens of Serbia know about the prosecutors' choice**: This is a subjective claim about public awareness, which is difficult to quantify without polling data or specific evidence.

2. **The prosecutors chose people from the regime to which Dragan Djilas belonged**: This part of the claim suggests that specific individuals were selected based on their association with Dragan Djilas's regime. Without specific names or evidence of this selection process, it's hard to verify.

3. **This happened in 2009 or 2010**: This is a factual claim about the timing of the events. Without historical records or news reports confirming this timeline, it's also difficult to verify.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, it is not possible to definitively classify it as true or false. However, the claim mixes subjective and objective elements, making it somewhat plausible but not fully verifiable.

However, based on the phrasing and the use of absolute terms like ""almost nothing left,"" it implies a dramatic decline, possibly to the point of near extinction.

Without specific data to validate the claim, it is challenging to assert its accuracy definitively. However, the claim's exaggerated language suggests it might be overstated.

Coronavirus becomes more contagious and more dangerous,false,ru,"The claim that 'Coronavirus becomes more contagious and more dangerous' is a complex one that requires careful examination.

1. **More Contagious**: It is true that certain variants of the coronavirus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, have been shown to be more contagious than the original strain. This is well-documented in scientific literature and by health authorities.

2. **More Dangerous**: The term ""more dangerous"" can be interpreted in various ways, such as increased severity of symptoms, higher mortality rates, or greater risk of long-term effects. While some variants have shown increased transmissibility, the evidence on their overall danger (in terms of severity and mortality) is more nuanced. For example, the Omicron variant is highly contagious but generally causes less severe illness compared to previous variants.

Given these points, the claim is partially accurate but oversimplifies the complexity of the situation.

Klarenbach states that the unemployment rate was almost 10% in 2015, while U. Augustyn claims it was a one-digit number, specifically ""9 and something.""

First, let's clarify that ""one-digit"" refers to numbers from 0 to 9.99. Therefore, a rate of ""9 and something"" (e.g., 9.5%) would indeed be a one-digit number.

Given this context:
- A. Klarenbach's claim of ""almost 10%"" is consistent with a rate in the high 9% range.
- U. Augustyn's claim of ""9 and something"" is also consistent with a rate in the 9% range.

Since both claims can be reconciled (a rate of 9.5% to 9.9% fits both descriptions), the claim by U. Augustyn that the unemployment rate was a one-digit number is mostly accurate, albeit with a slight discrepancy in specificity.

The claim suggests that Serbia is unique in having its government launch a password that the EU cannot counter or has no alternative to. This statement seems to imply a specific action or policy that puts Serbia in a unique position relative to the EU.

However, without additional context or specific details about what this ""password"" refers to, it is difficult to confirm the accuracy of the claim. Generally, claims about unique actions or policies require concrete evidence and clear examples to be substantiated.

Given the lack of specificity and the unusual phrasing, the claim appears to be an exaggeration or misinterpretation of a more complex political or diplomatic situation.

1. **VAT revenues for the first 4 months of this year are 57.5 billion, last year it was 56.8 billion.**
   - This is a factual statement that can be verified with data. If the data is accurate, then this part is true.

2. **This means that VAT affects us into the budget.**
   - This statement is true because VAT (Value Added Tax) revenues do contribute to the government's budget.

3. **VAT revenues grow much more slowly than consumption.**
   - This statement requires context and data to evaluate. If consumption has grown at a faster rate than the increase in VAT revenues, then this part is true. However, without specific data on consumption growth, we cannot definitively say whether this is accurate.

Return VAT to the card - up to 270 thousand rubles through the Unified Composed Center for the Refund of Usulate Cash,false,ru,"The claim 'Return VAT to the card - up to 270 thousand rubles through the Unified Composed Center for the Refund of Usulate Cash' contains several elements that need to be evaluated for accuracy:

1. **Return VAT to the card**: This is a common practice in many countries where value-added tax (VAT) can be refunded to consumers, often tourists, through various methods including cash or card refunds.

2. **Up to 270 thousand rubles**: Without specific context or verification from official sources, it is challenging to confirm the exact amount that can be refunded. However, VAT refund amounts are typically capped at a certain limit based on the country's regulations.

3. **Unified Composed Center for the Refund of Usulate Cash**: This term sounds made up and does not correspond to any known official entity or standard terminology related to VAT refunds.

Given the plausibility of VAT refunds but the dubious nature of the specific entity mentioned, the claim appears to be partly true but misleading in its details.

The countries that joined the EU in 2004, often referred to as the ""A10 countries,"" include Poland, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus, and Malta.

According to available data, Poland has been one of the largest recipients of EU structural and cohesion funds among the A10 countries. However, whether Poland received more funds than the combined total of the other nine countries is a specific claim that requires detailed financial data.

Based on general trends and data from EU reports, Poland has indeed received a significant amount of funds, but it is unlikely that Poland alone received more than the combined total of the other nine countries. The distribution of EU funds is designed to support all member states, and while Poland is a major beneficiary, the combined funds allocated to the other nine countries are also substantial.

Given this context, the claim that Poland received more funds than the combined total of the other nine countries is likely exaggerated.

If there is evidence that not all trams in Gdańsk are low-floor, then the president's statement is inaccurate.

The claim states that the president's assertion is not true, implying that there are trams in Gdańsk that are not low-floor. If this is indeed the case, then the claim is accurate in pointing out the president's error.

Without specific data, we cannot definitively confirm the exact proportion of low-floor trams in Gdańsk. However, if there is evidence that not all trams are low-floor, the claim that the president's statement is not true would be justified.

Given the information provided, the claim is asserting that the president's statement is false. Therefore, the claim itself is likely true.

"According to the ordinance of the Ministry of National Education, parents who want their children go to religion must submit a written statement in this matter.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the current regulations of the Ministry of National Education regarding religious instruction for children. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to specific ordinances or updates from the Ministry of National Education. However, I can provide a general approach to evaluating such claims.

If the Ministry of National Education has indeed issued an ordinance stating that parents must submit a written statement for their children to attend religious instruction, then the claim would be 'True'. If the ordinance exists but has some nuances or exceptions not covered in the claim, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the ordinance is partially correct but also contains significant inaccuracies, it could be 'Half True'. If the ordinance is largely inaccurate or misrepresented, it would be 'Mostly False'. If no such ordinance exists, the claim would be 'False'.

Without specific information on the ordinance, I cannot provide a definitive answer. Therefore, I recommend verifying the claim with the most recent and official sources from the Ministry of National Education.

Šešelj was acquitted of war crimes charges in March 2016, but the claim in question is from 2009 and predicts his return to Serbia during June or July of that year.

In reality, Šešelj was not released and did not return to Serbia in June or July 2009. His trial continued for several more years before his eventual acquittal in 2016. Therefore, the claim that he would return to Serbia during June or July 2009 is inaccurate.

According to recent reports from the Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS), the number of self-employed individuals in Poland has been consistently over a million. For instance, as of 2021, there were approximately 1.8 million self-employed persons in Poland.

It is thanks to the decisions of the Civic Platform that 40% of European funds are distributed by voivodship self -governments.,true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the historical context and the role of the Civic Platform in the distribution of European funds in Poland. The Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) was indeed a significant political party in Poland, and during its tenure, there were changes in the management of European funds.

The distribution of European funds through voivodship self-governments is a complex issue involving multiple factors, including EU policies, national policies, and regional governance structures. While the Civic Platform may have played a role in shaping policies that led to a portion of EU funds being managed by voivodship self-governments, attributing 40% directly to their decisions alone might oversimplify the matter.

Without specific data or a detailed analysis of the policies and their implementation, it's challenging to definitively state the exact percentage attributable to the Civic Platform. However, given the general influence political parties have on policy-making, it's plausible that they had some impact.

The statement claims that ""Serbia has been completely digitized from today, 97.8 percent of the population is covered by a digital signal, and the analog signal is going to history today.""

1. **""Serbia has been completely digitized from today""**: This suggests that the transition to digital signals is complete.
2. **""97.8 percent of the population is covered by a digital signal""**: This is a specific and quantifiable claim about the extent of digital signal coverage.
3. **""the analog signal is going to history today""**: This implies that analog signals are being phased out completely on this day.

Without specific, up-to-date data on Serbia's digital transition, we can analyze the claim based on typical scenarios and the plausibility of the figures provided.

- **97.8 percent coverage**: This is a high percentage and suggests near-complete coverage, which is plausible for a country transitioning to digital signals.
- **Complete digitization**: The phrase ""completely digitized"" suggests that there is no longer any analog signal in use, which is a strong claim.

Given that the claim includes a specific percentage (97.8 percent) and asserts complete digitization, it is likely that the claim is mostly accurate but may not account for very small pockets of the population that might still rely on analog signals due to various reasons (e.g., remote areas, technical difficulties).

"If a state [Poland] has 90 percent.European coal resources, it is based in a vast part on coal (...).",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim that Poland has 90 percent of European coal resources, we need to consider the actual distribution of coal resources across Europe.

According to various sources, including the European Commission and energy agencies, Poland is indeed one of the largest coal producers in Europe. However, it does not hold 90 percent of Europe's coal resources. Other countries like Germany, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine also have significant coal reserves.

Poland is estimated to have around 60-70 percent of Europe's hard coal reserves, which is substantial but not 90 percent. Additionally, when considering both hard coal and lignite (brown coal), the percentage is even lower because countries like Germany have large reserves of lignite.

Therefore, the claim that Poland has 90 percent of European coal resources is an overstatement.

"Still lying info, that the concordat is the work of SLD.MY for 4 years 1993-1997) We did not allow Suchocka to be ratified.",true,pl,"To evaluate this claim, we need to examine the historical context surrounding the Concordat between Poland and the Holy See and the role of different political parties and figures.

1. **Background on the Concordat**: The Concordat between Poland and the Holy See was signed on July 28, 1993. It was negotiated by the government of Hanna Suchocka, who served as Prime Minister from July 1992 to October 1993.

2. **Role of SLD (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej)**: The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) did not hold power during the negotiations and signing of the Concordat. The Concordat was primarily the work of the Suchocka government, which was supported by a coalition of parties that did not include the SLD.

3. **Ratification Process**: The Concordat was ratified by the Polish parliament (Sejm) in February 1998, during the term of the government led by Jerzy Buzek, who was from the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) party. The SLD was not in power during this period either.

Given this context:

- The claim that the Concordat is the work of the SLD is false.
- The claim that the SLD did not allow Suchocka to ratify the Concordat is misleading because the ratification occurred under a different government and after Suchocka's term.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these statements, we can't definitively say whether they are true or false. However, based on general knowledge, it's unlikely that a city would have no pools at all, and the claim about the kindergartens would require specific data about kindergarten sizes and numbers across the Balkans.

"""In the previous two years we built on the watercourses 29 dams.""",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim ""In the previous two years we built on the watercourses 29 dams,"" I would need specific data regarding the construction of dams over the past two years. Without concrete evidence or data, it is not possible to accurately determine the truthfulness of the statement. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume the following:

1. **True**: Verifiable records indicate that exactly 29 dams were built on the watercourses in the previous two years.
2. **Mostly True**: Records show that a number very close to 29 dams were built, with minor discrepancies.
3. **Half True**: Records indicate that a significant number of dams were built, but the number is considerably different from 29.
4. **Mostly False**: Records show that a number significantly different from 29 dams were built, but some construction did occur.
5. **False**: Records indicate that no dams or a very minimal number of dams were built, far from the claimed 29.

If we assume that the claim is based on some credible data source and that the unemployment rate is indeed around 25% for the specified age group in Kielce, then the claim could be considered true or mostly true. However, without verifiable data, it is difficult to confirm this.

Inflation for the previous year was announced: 3.4%.(...) Food in Poland was 7%more expensive.,half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the relationship between overall inflation and the increase in food prices. Inflation rates can vary significantly among different sectors of the economy. It's possible for overall inflation to be 3.4% while food prices specifically increase by 7%. This discrepancy can occur because the overall inflation rate is an average across all goods and services, and some sectors may experience higher or lower inflation than the average.

Given this context, the claim that ""Food in Poland was 7% more expensive"" while the overall inflation was 3.4% is plausible. It reflects a common scenario where specific sectors experience different rates of inflation.

Without specific details or sources to verify the claim, it is difficult to assess its accuracy conclusively. However, if this claim is based on official statements from credible sources such as government officials or EU representatives, it is more likely to be true. If the claim is speculative or based on unverified sources, it would be less reliable.

Given the lack of context or specific sources, a cautious approach would be to consider the claim as 'Half True'. This reflects the possibility that while the Netherlands may not block Serbia's candidacy, the final decision of the Council of EU Ministers could still be influenced by other factors.

"Of the 500 reviews that the Venetian Commission has issued in the last almost 30 years, a small amount has not been included in somehow - e.g. Putinian Russia or Lichtenstein.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the historical context and the operations of the Venetian Commission. The Venetian Commission, also known as the European Commission for Democracy through Law, is an advisory body of the Council of Europe. It provides legal advice to member states and helps them bring their laws and practices into line with European standards.

The claim suggests that out of the 500 reviews issued by the Venetian Commission over the last nearly 30 years, a small number have not been fully incorporated by certain countries, such as Putin's Russia or Liechtenstein.

Given the nature of the Venetian Commission's work and the fact that not all recommendations are always fully implemented by member states due to various political, legal, or practical reasons, it is reasonable to expect that some reviews have not been fully incorporated. However, without specific data on the number of reviews that have been implemented versus those that have not, it is difficult to quantify the claim precisely.

That said, the claim does not assert that a significant portion of the reviews have been ignored, only that a ""small amount"" has not been included. This is a plausible scenario considering the complexities involved in international legal advice and state sovereignty.

Therefore, based on the available information and the general understanding of how such advisory bodies operate, the claim is likely more true than false, but it may not be entirely accurate without specific data.

To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **ECA Funding for Exports:** ECAs typically provide financing and insurance to support the export of goods and services from their home countries.

2. **Long-Term Loans of Up to 85% for Nuclear Projects:** This specific detail needs to be verified. While ECAs often support large-scale projects, the exact percentages and terms can vary.

3. **Favorable Interest Rates:** ECAs often provide loans at competitive rates to make exports more attractive to foreign buyers.

Given the general practices of ECAs, it is plausible that they support large-scale projects like nuclear ones with significant financing, including favorable interest rates. However, the specific claim of 85% financing for nuclear projects would require verification from official ECA documentation or policies.

Without specific documentation, the claim is mostly accurate but lacks precise verification for the 85% figure.

3. **Lack of Vegetables, Fruits, and Juices**: The claim highlights a lack of these food groups, which are crucial for a balanced diet.

Without specific data or a detailed report from the Supreme Audit Office, it's challenging to verify the claim entirely. However, if the claim is based on a reputable audit report, there is a likelihood that it contains some truth. The severity of the deficiencies and the accuracy of the four-fold salt dose would need to be verified with specific data.

To verify these claims, we would need reliable data from official sources such as municipal reports, environmental studies, or urban planning documents. However, without access to specific data, we can make a general assessment based on typical urban green space percentages.

- Wrocław having just over 12% green areas is a specific claim that would need verification. If this number is accurate, it suggests a lower percentage compared to some other cities.
- The claim that almost 8% of these green areas are forests around Wrocław would reduce the actual green space within the city to around 4%, which is quite low.
- Katowice or Zielona Góra having over 40% green areas in the city is a significant claim. Many cities strive for high percentages of green space, but 40% is on the higher end and would need verification.

Without specific data, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of these claims definitively. However, the claim that Wrocław lacks greenery compared to Katowice or Zielona Góra, with specific percentages provided, suggests a significant disparity that might be exaggerated without further evidence.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Poland's VAT Rate**: Poland does have a standard VAT rate of 23%, which is among the highest in the EU. However, this rate is not specific to electricity; it is the general rate applied to most goods and services.

2. **Reduced VAT Rates**: Many EU countries, including the UK and France, apply reduced VAT rates to certain goods and services, including electricity. The reduced rate can be as low as 5%, but it varies by country and is not universally 5%.

3. **Comparison with Other Countries**: While Poland's standard VAT rate is high, other countries like Hungary (27%) and Croatia (25%) have even higher standard rates. Moreover, the application of reduced rates varies widely across the EU.

The calculation confirms the statement in the claim. Therefore, the claim is accurate based on the provided numbers.

Without access to specific legal texts or historical records, it's challenging to verify the claim fully. However, based on the information provided, we can analyze the plausibility.

1. **Act introduced in 2008**: If such an act was indeed introduced in 2008, it would be a documented piece of legislation.
2. **Limitation of money and pensions**: The act supposedly limited financial benefits for former employees of UB (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa) and SB (Służba Bezpieczeństwa), which are historical Polish security services.
3. **Repeal by the Constitutional Tribunal**: The claim states that a provision related to members of the Military Council of National Salvation was repealed by the Constitutional Tribunal.

3. **""And look at us politicians that no one knows English, except those who lived outside without saying that no one knows Russian.""** - This claim suggests that politicians in a certain context do not know English or Russian unless they lived abroad. This is a sweeping generalization that is unlikely to be true for all politicians.

4. **""And not to say that there are no one for the translator to find for French, not to say also for German.""** - This implies that there are no translators available for French or German, which is highly unlikely given the global demand for translation services.

"In 2016, more people came to Poland for the first time than they left [counted since the war].",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim that ""In 2016, more people came to Poland for the first time than they left [counted since the war],"" we need to consider the available data on immigration and emigration in Poland.

According to data from the Polish Central Statistical Office (GUS) and other sources, 2016 saw a significant increase in immigration to Poland, primarily driven by economic factors and labor market needs. This influx was largely due to an increase in work permits issued to foreigners, particularly from Ukraine.

On the other hand, emigration from Poland has been a long-term trend, with many Poles seeking better economic opportunities in other European countries. However, the net migration balance in Poland has shown a shift towards more people coming into the country as opposed to leaving, particularly in recent years.

Given the data and trends, the claim that in 2016 more people came to Poland for the first time than left is generally supported by the available statistics. While the exact numbers may vary, the overall trend aligns with the statement.

The turnout in local elections is just over 30%.,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim that ""The turnout in local elections is just over 30%,"" we need to consider available data and trends in voter participation for local elections. Generally, local elections tend to have lower turnout compared to national elections. While turnout can vary significantly based on the specific location and context, the average turnout for local elections is often cited to be around 20-30%.

Given this information, the claim that the turnout is ""just over 30%"" is somewhat accurate but may overstate the typical turnout slightly. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization for this claim would be:

"I know data from the Jarosław commune.There, two weeks ago, in the first round there were about 50% of attendance, now there were 30% attendance.",true,pl,"To accurately assess the claim, we need to verify the voter turnout rates for both the first and second rounds of the election in the Jarosław commune. Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively confirm or deny the numbers provided. However, if we assume the claim is based on publicly available or verifiable data, we can proceed with an analysis.

The claim states:
1. In the first round, there was about 50% attendance.
2. In the second round, there was 30% attendance.

If these numbers are accurate based on official records or reliable sources, then the claim would be true. If there is some discrepancy but the general trend (a significant drop in attendance) holds true, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the numbers are significantly off but the trend is correct, it could be 'Half True'. If the numbers are mostly incorrect, it would be 'Mostly False'. If completely incorrect, it would be 'False'.

"Poland provides two million delegated employees in this group, who move around Europe every year, about 1/4 - half a million.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. ""Poland provides two million delegated employees in this group, who move around Europe every year"": This claim suggests that Poland sends out 2 million workers annually to other European countries.
2. ""about 1/4 - half a million"": This part of the claim is unclear and seems to contradict the initial statement. If Poland provides 2 million workers, then 1/4 to half a million would be a much smaller number (0.5 million to 1 million).

According to available data, Poland indeed has a significant number of workers who migrate to other European countries, but the number is not as high as 2 million annually. As of recent estimates, the number of Polish citizens working abroad is closer to 1-2 million in total, not annually.

Given the discrepancy in the numbers and the unclear phrasing, the claim is not entirely accurate.

The claim states that the dividend increased from 680 million dinars to 5.1 billion dinars, which is almost eight times more.

First, let's calculate the exact multiple of increase:

\[ \text{Multiple of increase} = \frac{5.1 \text{ billion dinars}}{680 \text{ million dinars}} \]

Converting 5.1 billion dinars to millions for consistency:

\[ 5.1 \text{ billion dinars} = 5100 \text{ million dinars} \]

Now, calculate the multiple:

\[ \text{Multiple of increase} = \frac{5100 \text{ million dinars}}{680 \text{ million dinars}} \approx 7.5 \]

The claim states ""almost eight times more,"" and the calculated multiple is approximately 7.5, which is indeed close to eight.

Therefore, the claim is accurately representing the increase in the dividend paid to the Budget of the City of Belgrade.

"The Minister of Defense is entitled to receive information different from SKW, but he is not entitled to read some operational materials",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the typical roles and access levels of a Minister of Defense. Generally, a Minister of Defense has broad authority and access to a wide range of information, including sensitive and operational materials. However, there may be specific circumstances or restrictions based on the classification level of the information.

The claim states that the Minister of Defense is entitled to receive information different from SKW (assuming SKW refers to a specific category or source of information) but is not entitled to read some operational materials. This suggests a nuanced understanding of access levels, where the Minister might have access to most information but could be restricted from certain operational details, possibly due to security clearance levels or specific protocols.

Given the complexity and potential variability in access levels, the claim is likely more nuanced than a simple true or false. It acknowledges both the Minister's broad access and potential restrictions, making it more accurate than not but not entirely precise without additional context.

1. **CO2 Emissions**: Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power, known as the ""Energiewende,"" has led to an increased reliance on coal for electricity generation in some periods, which can contribute to higher CO2 emissions. However, the overall trend in Germany's CO2 emissions has been influenced by multiple factors, including the growth of renewable energy sources.

2. **Electricity Prices**: The decommissioning of nuclear reactors has contributed to changes in the electricity market, and there has been a rise in electricity prices in Germany. This is partly due to the costs associated with the transition to renewable energy and the phase-out of nuclear power.

3. **Grid Volatility**: The integration of renewable energy sources, particularly wind and solar, has indeed introduced greater volatility into the electrical grid. This is because these sources are dependent on weather conditions and can vary significantly over time.

"Receiving immigrants to Poland increases the threat of terrorism and it was not only in Paris that they showed, not only in Brussels, but also attention, the outbreak a few days ago in Ankara, because there, after all, this so -called refugee was the perpetrator of this assassination.",false,pl,"The claim that receiving immigrants to Poland increases the threat of terrorism and citing specific incidents in Paris, Brussels, and Ankara as evidence is not supported by comprehensive data and analysis. While there have been isolated incidents involving refugees or immigrants in acts of terrorism, the overall impact of immigration on terrorism risk is complex and not straightforward. Studies have shown that immigrants are not more likely to commit acts of terrorism compared to native-born individuals, and the risk is often exaggerated.

### Analysis:
- **Isolated Incidents**: The incidents in Paris, Brussels, and Ankara are specific examples and do not represent a general trend.
- **Statistical Evidence**: Multiple studies and research indicate that the overall impact of immigration on terrorism is minimal and that immigrants are less likely to be involved in criminal or terrorist activities compared to native-born citizens.
- **Poland's Context**: Poland has not experienced a significant increase in terrorism linked to immigrants, and the country's immigration policies have been relatively restrictive, limiting the inflow of refugees and immigrants.

### Conclusion:
The claim that receiving immigrants to Poland increases the threat of terrorism is largely unfounded based on available data and research. The specific incidents cited do not provide sufficient evidence to support a generalized statement about the impact of immigration on terrorism.

The claim suggests a significant discrepancy between the promised and actual levels of Polish industry participation. If the promise was indeed 50% and the current participation is less than 5%, the claim would be largely accurate in highlighting this discrepancy.

However, for the sake of argument, let's assume that Djilas was not in a position of power in 2008 and that the response to Kosovo's independence was indeed inadequate or ""funny"" as described.

Given the lack of specific verification, the claim seems to mix factual elements (Djilas's position) with subjective interpretations (the nature of the announcements). Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim appears to be a mix of truth and interpretation.

The European Tribunal has expressed the view that the compulsion to any medical activities is contrary to human rights.,false,pl,"The statement is generally accurate, but it requires some contextual clarification to determine its precise truth value. The European Court of Human Rights has, in various cases, upheld the principle of informed consent and the right to refuse medical treatment, emphasizing that compulsion in medical activities can indeed be contrary to human rights. However, the specifics can vary depending on the context and the particular legal case.

Given this, the statement is mostly accurate but may benefit from additional nuance.

"First of all, we must look at the fact that the fertility rate has increased (after the introduction of the 500+ program, note Demagoga).",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim that ""the fertility rate has increased (after the introduction of the 500+ program),"" we need to consider data and studies that analyze the impact of the 500+ program on fertility rates.

The 500+ program, also known as ""Family 500+,"" is a social welfare program introduced in Poland in 2016. It provides a monthly subsidy of 500 PLN per child to families with at least two children. The primary goal of the program was to increase the birth rate and support families financially.

Several studies and analyses have been conducted to assess the impact of the 500+ program on fertility rates. Some findings suggest that there has been a slight increase in the fertility rate following the introduction of the program. However, the increase is modest, and other factors such as economic conditions, cultural shifts, and demographic trends also play significant roles in fertility rates.

Given the available evidence, it is accurate to say that there has been some increase in the fertility rate, but it is not solely attributable to the 500+ program. Therefore, the claim is partially true but overstates the impact of the program.

"Today, Germany has 80% of the debt to GDP - 80%.We have 51%.France has 100%.",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim about the debt-to-GDP ratios of Germany, France, and the United States, we need to compare the given figures with recent data. According to reputable sources such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the debt-to-GDP ratios as of 2021 are approximately:

- Germany: Around 70%
- United States: Around 133%
- France: Around 116%

Comparing these figures with the claim:

- Germany is stated to have 80% debt-to-GDP, but the actual figure is around 70%, which is close but not exact.
- The United States is stated to have 51% debt-to-GDP, but the actual figure is much higher, around 133%.
- France is stated to have 100% debt-to-GDP, but the actual figure is around 116%.

Given these discrepancies, especially the significant difference for the United States, the claim is not accurate.

"However, from the very beginning, both the government of Ewa Kopacz and we all opposed the mechanisms of constant relocation.",false,pl,"To accurately assess the truthfulness of the claim, we would need to know the context and have access to verifiable information about the positions of the government of Ewa Kopacz and the broader public opinion on the mechanisms of constant relocation. Without specific details or sources to verify the claim, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.

However, if we assume the claim is based on known public statements and actions by the Ewa Kopacz government and general public sentiment, we can make an educated guess. If the claim aligns with documented statements and policies, it could be considered 'Mostly True' or 'True'. If there is significant evidence to the contrary or if the claim is only partially supported by known facts, it could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'. If the claim is entirely unsupported by known facts, it would be 'False'.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"As we all remember, prof.Lech Kaczyński was a supporter of an abortion compromise.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim that ""Prof. Lech Kaczyński was a supporter of an abortion compromise,"" we need to consider the historical context and the actual positions held by Lech Kaczyński on the issue of abortion.

Lech Kaczyński, who served as the President of Poland from 2005 until his death in 2010, was known for his conservative views on social issues. He was a member of the Law and Justice party (PiS), which has typically taken a strong stance against abortion. During his political career, Kaczyński did not publicly advocate for a compromise on abortion laws. Instead, he was generally aligned with the party's position, which favored stricter regulations on abortion.

Given this context, the claim that Lech Kaczyński was a supporter of an abortion compromise is not supported by his known political stances and actions. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.

"""We are the only party that has invested an official complaint and lawsuit against election results.You remember how the Fama was, and now everyone was silent when they saw them crossed the census. """,half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Unique Official Complaint and Lawsuit**: The claim states that they are the only party to have filed an official complaint and lawsuit against election results. This would require verification against records to see if other parties also filed complaints or lawsuits.

2. **Reference to ""Fama"" and ""Census""**: The terms ""Fama"" and ""crossed the census"" are not clear without additional context. It seems to refer to some specific event or situation that might not be widely known or understood without more information.

Without specific evidence or context, it's difficult to definitively say whether the claim is true or false. However, the claim that they are the only party to have filed a complaint and lawsuit is a strong assertion that would need substantial backing evidence to be considered true.

Given the lack of specific details and the need for context and verification, the claim leans towards being unverifiable without further information.

"The famous graphene was sold, it turns out that it will be produced in Great Britain.How could we lose such a wonderful Polish invention?",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Graphene's Discovery**: Graphene was discovered by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester, UK, in 2004. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for this discovery.

2. **Production of Graphene**: The claim suggests that graphene will be produced in Great Britain. This is true to some extent, as the University of Manchester is a hub for graphene research and production. However, graphene is also being produced and researched in many other countries, including Poland.

3. **Polish Invention**: The claim that graphene is a Polish invention is false. As mentioned, it was discovered in the UK.

Considering these points, the claim is a mix of true and false statements. While it's true that graphene is being produced in Great Britain, it's false to claim that it is a Polish invention.

City buses travel 100 million km a year around Warsaw (...).,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim that ""City buses travel 100 million km a year around Warsaw,"" we need to consider the feasibility of this number given available data and logical reasoning.

1. **Population and Bus Usage**: Warsaw has a population of approximately 1.8 million people. Assuming a significant portion of the population uses public transportation, this could result in a high number of bus trips.

2. **Distance per Trip**: The average distance for a city bus trip in a metropolitan area like Warsaw might be around 10-20 km per trip.

3. **Number of Buses**: Warsaw has a fleet of several hundred buses. Let's assume around 1,000 buses for the sake of estimation.

4. **Trips per Day**: Each bus might make multiple trips per day. Assuming an average of 20 trips per bus per day, this would result in 20,000 trips per day for the entire fleet.

5. **Annual Trips**: Over a year (365 days), this would be approximately 7.3 million trips per year.

6. **Total Distance**: If each trip is 15 km on average, the total distance covered by all buses in a year would be around 109.5 million km.

Given these estimates, the claim that city buses travel 100 million km a year around Warsaw is plausible.

Vaccines [for pig flu] were bought for all residents [other EU countries].,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim ""Vaccines [for pig flu] were bought for all residents [other EU countries],"" we need to consider the accuracy and context of the statement.

1. **Context**: The claim suggests that vaccines for pig flu (likely referring to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic) were purchased for all residents in other EU countries.
2. **Accuracy**: During the H1N1 swine flu pandemic, many countries, including EU member states, did purchase large quantities of vaccines. However, it is unlikely that every single resident in these countries was guaranteed a vaccine due to logistical, supply, and public health strategy reasons.
3. **Interpretation**: The claim implies a universal provision of vaccines, which is an overstatement. While significant efforts were made to acquire vaccines, complete coverage for all residents is not typically achieved in such scenarios.

Based on this analysis, the claim is exaggerated.

"In the capital last year there were 11 vehicles equipped with specialized equipment, and each of them was directed to several interventions per day.",true,pl,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we would need specific data on the number of specialized vehicles in the capital last year and their frequency of interventions. Without this data, it's impossible to make an accurate assessment.

However, the claim uses vague language such as ""several interventions per day,"" which makes it difficult to verify or refute. The term ""several"" can mean different things to different people, so even if data were available, the claim's truthfulness could still be debated.

Given the lack of specific data and the vague language used, the most accurate assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"The fact that the Polish army will have nearly 200,000soldiers, officers, is a fact.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at the current size of the Polish army.

In Łeba where 4 ha of forest was cut.Where the ecological corridor went.,true,pl,"To evaluate the claim that ""In Łeba where 4 ha of forest was cut. Where the ecological corridor went,"" we would need to verify specific details such as the location, the amount of forest cut, and the existence and impact on an ecological corridor. Without additional context or sources to verify these details, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, based on the limited information provided, the claim suggests a specific event with precise details. If such an event occurred and can be verified through reliable sources, the claim could be considered true or mostly true. If the details are exaggerated or unverifiable, it might lean towards half true, mostly false, or false.

Since we lack the specific verification, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false. Therefore, based on the information given, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The Independence March is reported by the Independence March Association as a cyclical assembly by 2020 inclusive.,true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the historical context and the organization's statements regarding the Independence March. The Independence March is an annual event organized by the Independence March Association in Poland, typically held on November 11 to commemorate Polish Independence Day.

The claim states that the Independence March is reported by the Independence March Association as a cyclical assembly by 2020 inclusive. This means that the organization has reported the march as an annual event up until the year 2020.

Without specific documentation or statements from the Independence March Association, we can rely on general knowledge and historical records. The Independence March has indeed been an annual event, and there is no widely known information that contradicts the claim for the period up to 2020.

Given this context, the claim appears to be accurate based on the available information.

"In Sweden, mandatory vaccinations were banned",false,ru,"The claim that ""In Sweden, mandatory vaccinations were banned"" is not entirely accurate. Sweden does not have a law that explicitly bans mandatory vaccinations.

There are no laws making vaccinations mandatory, but there is also no explicit ban on mandatory vaccinations. Therefore, the claim is not entirely true.

Extraction waste and ash from coal burning are 60% of all economic waste in Poland,true,pl,"The claim that ""Extraction waste and ash from coal burning are 60% of all economic waste in Poland"" requires verification against reliable data sources to determine its accuracy.

As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have real-time access to current statistical data on waste composition in Poland. However, it is known that Poland relies heavily on coal for energy production, which does generate significant amounts of waste such as coal ash and extraction waste.

To provide an accurate assessment, one would need to consult recent reports from environmental agencies, statistical offices, or other authoritative sources in Poland. If such sources indicate that extraction waste and coal ash indeed constitute 60% of all economic waste, then the claim would be considered accurate.

Without specific data, I can offer a general assessment based on typical waste compositions in coal-dependent economies. In many such economies, coal waste does make up a significant portion of overall waste, but the exact percentage can vary.

Given the lack of specific data, a cautious approach would be to classify the claim as:

Final Answer: Half True

This classification assumes that while coal waste is indeed a substantial part of economic waste in Poland, the exact figure of 60% needs verification from reliable sources.",,False,True
"For 20 years, however, salaries, when they were introduced, were seven times of average salary.Today, even these are not two average salaries.",half true,pl,"The claim appears to be comparing the evolution of certain salaries over time, stating that they initially were seven times the average salary but now are not even twice the average salary.

1. **Initial Period (20 years ago)**: The salaries were seven times the average salary.
2. **Current Period**: The salaries are not even twice the average salary.

Without specific data to verify the exact figures, the claim is based on a comparison over time. The statement suggests a significant drop in the relative value of these salaries compared to the average salary.

Given the lack of specific data, the claim can be considered plausible but not definitively proven. Therefore, it is reasonable to categorize it as 'Half True' because it presents a relative decline but does not provide concrete evidence to fully substantiate the exact magnitudes mentioned.

1. **Flood 10 Years Ago**: The claim states that Jarosław Kaczyński, while in the opposition, considered the introduction of a state of natural disaster justified when 25 people died in a flood. This suggests that he believed a state of natural disaster was warranted due to the severity of the situation.

2. **Coronavirus Epidemic**: The claim states that now, with 59 people having died due to the coronavirus epidemic, Kaczyński does not see the premises for introducing a state of natural disaster.

To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify:
- Whether Kaczyński indeed advocated for a state of natural disaster during the flood 10 years ago.
- Whether Kaczyński has stated that he does not see the premises for a state of natural disaster during the current coronavirus epidemic.

Without specific quotes or sources to verify these statements, we can only assess the claim based on the information provided. If the statements are accurately represented, the claim highlights a discrepancy in Kaczyński's position on declaring a state of natural disaster in response to different crises.

**Final Answer:** Half True

Explanation: The claim is based on reported statements and positions, but without direct verification from Kaczyński's exact words or context, it is difficult to definitively label it as entirely true or false.

Given the information provided, the claim seems to be a personal assertion of integrity and self-fidelity.

Small and medium -sized enterprises produce 50 percent of Polish GDP.,false,pl,"To assess the claim that ""Small and medium-sized enterprises produce 50 percent of Polish GDP,"" we need to refer to reliable economic data. According to various sources, including the European Commission and Eurostat, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) indeed play a significant role in the Polish economy. They contribute substantially to GDP, employment, and innovation.

However, the exact percentage can vary depending on the source and the specific time period. Generally, SMEs in Poland are known to contribute around 50% to GDP, which aligns with the claim. This contribution is consistent with trends observed in many European countries.

2. Everything agrees with the program.

Without additional context regarding the program, we can only evaluate the first point. If the new law indeed sets the maximum rate at 9.99, then the claim about the maximum rate is true. However, the statement ""everything agrees with my program"" is vague and cannot be verified without knowing the specifics of the program.

Given that the claim about the maximum rate is the only verifiable part of the statement and assuming it is accurate, the overall claim is mostly true but lacks context for full verification.

3. **Traveling by train will be much better than by car.**
4. **The route is center-center.**

Without specific, real-time data or official sources confirming the progress and exact timelines of the railway projects, it's challenging to definitively verify each point. However, we can make some general observations:

- **Work underway:** If there are official announcements or visible construction activities, this part could be true.
- **Travel time of 40 minutes:** This is a specific claim that would require official timetables or project updates to confirm.
- **Train better than car:** This is subjective and depends on various factors like traffic, train schedule reliability, and personal preference.

1. **Basics of Programming**: At this age, children are typically introduced to very foundational concepts of programming, often through educational games and simple visual programming tools (e.g., Scratch Jr.). However, the depth and breadth of programming knowledge are limited.

2. **Basics of Chess**: Chess can be introduced at a young age, and children in grades 1-3 can learn the basic rules and moves. However, a deep understanding of chess strategy and tactics is generally beyond their grasp at this stage.

Given these points, the claim that children in grades 1-3 already have the basics of programming and chess is somewhat overstated but not entirely false. They may have been exposed to these subjects but are unlikely to have a comprehensive understanding of the basics.

"(...) E -polion, thrown out of 19 million, empathy 50 million for an unnecessary portal, and 66 billion in my Lower Silesia.",false,pl,"The statement you've provided appears to be fragmented and lacks sufficient context for a thorough verification. However, based on the information presented, it refers to financial figures and criticisms related to expenditures in a region named Lower Silesia. Without specific details or sources to verify the claims, it is challenging to determine the accuracy of the statement.

Given the lack of context and verifiable information, the most appropriate classification would be:

"I remind you that many of these civic projects, including the project of Mrs. Kai Godek, who prohibited abortion, received the Sejm years ago.The abortion project was (...) three years ago (...), a project prohibiting sex education two years ago.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Whether Mrs. Kai Godek proposed a project prohibiting abortion.
2. Whether this project was discussed or received by the Sejm (Polish parliament) three years ago.
3. Whether a project prohibiting sex education was discussed or received by the Sejm two years ago.

Without specific dates or additional context, it's challenging to verify these claims accurately. However, based on general knowledge and typical legislative processes:

1. It is plausible that civic projects, including those related to abortion and sex education, have been proposed and discussed in the Sejm.
2. The timeline of three years ago for the abortion project and two years ago for the sex education project seems specific but could be accurate depending on the actual legislative records.

Given the lack of specific evidence to confirm or deny the exact timeline and details, the claim appears to be a mix of potentially accurate and unverifiable information. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization would be:

**Final Answer: Half True**",half true,False,False
Palm oil causes cancer and makes men sterile,half true,ru,"The claim that ""Palm oil causes cancer and makes men sterile"" is not supported by scientific evidence.

"""At this point in Serbia, there are about 2,000 unemployed agronomics in Serbia.""",true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we would need reliable and up-to-date data on the number of unemployed agronomics (agricultural scientists) in Serbia. Since I don't have real-time access to specific databases or the latest statistical reports, I can't verify the exact number. However, I can provide a general approach to how one might assess the claim:

1. **Check Official Statistics**: Look at data from Serbia's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Management or the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia.
2. **Labor Market Reports**: Review reports from labor market analysis organizations or employment agencies.
3. **Professional Associations**: Consult with professional associations for agronomics to get insights into employment trends.

Without specific data, it's challenging to give a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge, such a specific claim would likely have some basis in reality but might not be perfectly accurate. Therefore, without concrete evidence, the claim could be considered 'Half True'.

"Pursuant to the regulation, in class I, II, III it is 20 hours, in class IV: 24 hours, in the V-VI class: 25, and in class VII: 32 and 31 in class VIII.",true,pl,"Final Answer: Mostly True. The statement provides specific hour allocations for each class, which suggests a detailed regulation. However, without additional context or verification of the regulation itself, it's challenging to confirm if it's entirely accurate. Thus, 'Mostly True' reflects that the statement appears detailed and likely correct but lacks absolute confirmation.",,False,True
"""Alleged political disagreements between the Association of Vojvodina Hungarians and the Democratic Parties are a deliberate media manipulation and serve to draw attention from the Anti-Statement of Vojvodina.""",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim that ""Alleged political disagreements between the Association of Vojvodina Hungarians and the Democratic Parties are a deliberate media manipulation and serve to draw attention from the Anti-Statement of Vojvodina,"" we need to consider the context and evidence supporting or refuting this statement.

Without specific evidence or context provided in the claim, it is challenging to definitively determine its truthfulness. However, we can analyze the claim based on general principles of media manipulation and political disagreements.

1. **Media Manipulation**: It is plausible that media outlets could manipulate information to create a narrative that serves a particular agenda. However, without concrete evidence or examples, this claim remains speculative.

2. **Political Disagreements**: Political disagreements between different parties or associations are common and can be genuine reflections of differing ideologies or interests.

3. **Drawing Attention**: The claim suggests that the media is deliberately using these disagreements to distract from another issue, the ""Anti-Statement of Vojvodina."" This requires evidence of a coordinated effort to divert attention.

Given the lack of specific evidence in the claim, it is difficult to conclusively determine its truthfulness. Therefore, the claim can be considered speculative and lacking sufficient evidence to be fully true or false.

"For many years, when the Civic Platform and PSL ruled, the teachers did not get any increases at all.",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim accurately, we would need specific data on teacher salary increases during the years when the Civic Platform (PO) and Polish People's Party (PSL) were in power. However, without specific data, we can provide a general approach to assessing such a claim.

1. **Check Official Records**: Look at official government records, budgets, and reports on public sector salaries, specifically for teachers.
2. **Media Reports**: Review media coverage and reports from the time period in question to see if there were any notable increases or lack thereof.
3. **Union Statements**: Teacher unions often keep detailed records of salary negotiations and outcomes.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare teacher salaries over the years to see if there were any significant changes.

Given the lack of specific data in your request, a general assessment based on common knowledge and typical government practices would suggest that it is unlikely that there were no increases at all over many years. Governments typically adjust public sector salaries periodically to account for inflation and cost of living.
