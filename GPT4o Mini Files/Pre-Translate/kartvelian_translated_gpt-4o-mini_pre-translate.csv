If interest rates were 21% and were reduced by 3 times, that would imply they are now 21% / 3 = 7%. 

To determine the truth of the claim, we would need to verify the actual interest rates during the previous government and the current rates. However, without specific data or context about the interest rates during the previous government and the current rates, we cannot definitively assess the accuracy of the claim.

Given that the statement could be true if the interest rates were indeed reduced from 21% to 7%, but we lack the necessary information to confirm this, we can categorize the claim as ""Half True"" since it presents a plausible scenario but lacks verification.

1. The budget in 2012 was 131 million.
2. The current budget is 236 million.
3. The growth percentage is stated as 57%.

To calculate the growth percentage:

- The increase in budget = Current budget - Previous budget = 236 million - 131 million = 105 million.
- The growth percentage = (Increase / Previous budget) * 100 = (105 million / 131 million) * 100 ≈ 80.15%.

Since the calculated growth percentage (approximately 80.15%) does not match the claimed growth of 57%, the claim is incorrect.
