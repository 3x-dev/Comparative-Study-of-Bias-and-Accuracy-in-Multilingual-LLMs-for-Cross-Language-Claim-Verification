"Calf deaths are 15 percent in our country.About 500 thousand calves die each year.When we stop calf deaths, live animal imports will be avoided spontaneously.",mostly true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the components:

1. **Calf deaths are 15 percent in our country**: This statement would need to be verified with specific data from the country in question. If accurate, it suggests a significant mortality rate among calves.

2. **About 500 thousand calves die each year**: This figure can be cross-referenced with agricultural statistics. If the 15% mortality rate is accurate and corresponds to a known population of calves, this could be true.

3. **When we stop calf deaths, live animal imports will be avoided spontaneously**: This is a more complex assertion. While reducing calf deaths could potentially decrease the need for imports (if the country can sustain its own calf population), it is not guaranteed that all imports would cease. Factors such as demand, market conditions, and trade agreements also play a role.

Given these points, the claim has elements that could be true, but the conclusion about stopping imports is more speculative and not definitively supported by the preceding statements.

"When the AK Party came to power, we were buying 85 liters of gasoline for 50 TL, now we get 7 liters of gasoline.",mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context of gasoline prices and purchasing power over time since the AK Party came to power in Turkey in 2002. 

1. **Historical Context**: When the AK Party came to power, gasoline prices were significantly lower than they are today. The claim states that 85 liters could be bought for 50 TL, which would imply a price of approximately 0.59 TL per liter at that time.

2. **Current Prices**: As of late 2023, gasoline prices in Turkey have risen significantly, often exceeding 30 TL per liter. If we take this into account, the claim that one can now only buy 7 liters for the same amount (50 TL) would imply a price of about 7.14 TL per liter, which is consistent with current prices.

3. **Purchasing Power**: The claim also implicitly addresses the issue of inflation and changes in purchasing power. While the price of gasoline has indeed increased, the overall economic conditions, including inflation and income levels, also play a crucial role in determining how much gasoline can be purchased.

Given these considerations, the claim reflects a significant change in gasoline prices and purchasing power since the AK Party came to power, but it simplifies a complex economic situation.

"If our potential to create employment were at the level of 90s, today's lack of work increased to 14 percent, and our unemployed number would be 3.5 million people.",half true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down:

1. The claim states that if the potential to create employment were at the level of the 1990s, the unemployment rate today would be 14 percent.
2. It also states that this would result in 3.5 million unemployed people.

To assess the truth of this claim, we need to consider the following:

- The unemployment rate of 14 percent is significantly higher than typical rates in many economies, suggesting a severe economic downturn or structural issues.
- The number of unemployed people (3.5 million) must be contextualized within the total labor force. If the labor force is large enough, a 14 percent unemployment rate could indeed correspond to 3.5 million unemployed individuals.

However, without specific data on the current labor force size and the historical context of employment creation in the 1990s, it's difficult to definitively categorize the claim. 

Given that the claim presents a hypothetical scenario and lacks concrete data to support the assertion about the relationship between employment potential and current unemployment rates, it leans towards being speculative.

1. **Foreign Debt in 2002**: The claim states that Turkey's gross foreign debt was 130 billion dollars in 2002. This figure is generally accepted as accurate.

2. **Foreign Debt in 2016**: The claim states that Turkey's gross foreign debt rose to 421.4 billion dollars as of the first half of 2016. This figure also aligns with various economic reports from that time.

3. **Percentage Increase**: To calculate the percentage increase from 130 billion to 421.4 billion:
   - Increase = 421.4 billion - 130 billion = 291.4 billion
   - Percentage Increase = (291.4 billion / 130 billion) * 100 = approximately 224.9%

The claim states that Turkey's foreign debt increased by 225.2 percent during the AK Party governments, which is very close to the calculated percentage increase of approximately 224.9%. 

Given that the figures are accurate and the percentage increase is correctly represented, the claim can be considered accurate.

1. The report states that the daily expenditure of the palace in 2019 was 10 million pounds.
2. It also states that the annual expenditure for 2019 was 3.6 billion pounds.
3. The claim mentions that the daily expenditure in 2018 was 2.5 million pounds and that it increased 4 times in 2019.

Now, let's verify the calculations:

- If the daily expenditure in 2018 was 2.5 million pounds, then an increase of 4 times would mean:
  \( 2.5 \text{ million} \times 4 = 10 \text{ million} \) pounds.

This matches the reported daily expenditure for 2019.

- To check the annual expenditure based on the daily expenditure:
  \( 10 \text{ million} \times 365 \text{ days} = 3.65 \text{ billion} \) pounds.

However, the report states the annual expenditure was 3.6 billion pounds, which is slightly less than the calculated 3.65 billion pounds.

Given that the daily expenditure claim is accurate and the annual expenditure is very close to the calculated value, we can conclude that the overall claim is mostly true, but not perfectly accurate due to the slight discrepancy in the annual expenditure.

Without specific data to verify the exact rankings, I cannot definitively assess the truth of the claim.

- In Turkey, the number of midwives is 252 per 100,000 people.
- In EU countries, the number of midwives is 836 per 100,000 people.

Now, let's compare these two figures:

- 836 (EU) divided by 252 (Turkey) equals approximately 3.32.

This means that the number of midwives in EU countries is indeed more than three times that of Turkey.

Since the claim states that the number of midwives in EU countries is ""more than three times"" that of Turkey, this is accurate.

2. ""Last year's 4 percent growth is more than twice the rising economy."" - This part is ambiguous. If we interpret ""the rising economy"" as the average growth from 2010 to 2014 (5.4 percent), then twice that would be 10.8 percent. In this case, 4 percent is not more than twice 5.4 percent, making this statement false.

Given that the second part of the claim is false, we can conclude that the overall claim is misleading.

"200 TL was first released on January 1, 2009.When it was released, the dollar rate was 1.52.In other words, $ 131 with 200 TL could be purchased.Today, the dollar rate is 7.16.With 200 TL, only $ 27 can be purchased.Turkish Lira has not lost so much for a period",mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the information provided:

1. The Turkish Lira (TL) was first released at a rate of 1.52 TL per dollar, meaning that with 200 TL, one could buy approximately $131 (200 TL / 1.52 TL/USD).
2. Today, the dollar rate is 7.16 TL per dollar, meaning that with 200 TL, one can buy approximately $27 (200 TL / 7.16 TL/USD).
3. The claim states that the Turkish Lira has not lost so much value over this period.

To assess the loss in value:
- In 2009, $131 could be purchased with 200 TL.
- Today, only $27 can be purchased with the same amount of TL.

Calculating the percentage loss:
- The initial value in dollars was $131.
- The current value in dollars is $27.
- The loss in value is $131 - $27 = $104.
- The percentage loss is ($104 / $131) * 100 ≈ 79.39%.

This indicates a significant depreciation of the Turkish Lira against the dollar over the period from 2009 to now.

Given this analysis, the claim that ""Turkish Lira has not lost so much for a period"" is misleading, as the Lira has indeed lost a substantial amount of value.

"As of the end of 2013, we have a 32 billion kWh loss of energy in a total of 21 distribution zones.This is almost 15 percent of a total of 229 billion kWh gross consumption.",true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the figures provided:

1. The claim states that there is a 32 billion kWh loss of energy in 21 distribution zones.
2. It also states that this loss represents almost 15 percent of a total gross consumption of 229 billion kWh.

To check the percentage:
- Calculate 15% of 229 billion kWh:
  \[
  0.15 \times 229 \text{ billion kWh} = 34.35 \text{ billion kWh}
  \]

Since 32 billion kWh is less than 34.35 billion kWh, the claim that 32 billion kWh is ""almost 15 percent"" of 229 billion kWh is not accurate, as it is actually about 13.95% (calculated as \( \frac{32}{229} \times 100 \approx 13.95\% \)).

Thus, while the loss of 32 billion kWh and the total consumption of 229 billion kWh may be correct, the assertion that this loss is ""almost 15 percent"" is misleading.

"There is a support law about the farmer.He says that less than 1 %of national income should not be allocated.Our national income is now around 4.5 trillion.1 %is 45 billion, now 16 billion has been given that means that it would be given more than 29 billion, it is not given.",mostly true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break down the information provided:

1. The national income is stated to be around 4.5 trillion.
2. 1% of 4.5 trillion is calculated as follows:
   - 1% of 4.5 trillion = 0.01 * 4.5 trillion = 45 billion.
3. The claim states that 16 billion has already been allocated, and more than 29 billion is still needed to meet the 1% threshold.
4. If 16 billion has been allocated, then to reach 45 billion, the remaining amount needed would be:
   - 45 billion - 16 billion = 29 billion.

The claim asserts that more than 29 billion has not been given, which aligns with the calculation that only 16 billion has been allocated so far.

Since the claim accurately reflects the calculations regarding the allocation of funds in relation to the national income and the 1% threshold, we can conclude that the claim is true.

The claim states that the labor force participation rate of women was 31.6 percent and that this is less than half of the labor force participation rate of men.

If we assume that the labor force participation rate of men in November 2015 was around 63 percent (which is a reasonable estimate based on historical data), then half of that would be 31.5 percent. Since 31.6 percent is slightly more than 31.5 percent, the claim that women's participation is ""less than half"" of men's participation is incorrect.

Therefore, the claim is ""False.""
