"""In the first five months, we had a deficit of 25 billion dinars instead of planned 90 billion, which is three and a half times less than what the IMF would be satisfied.""",mostly true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to analyze the figures presented. The statement mentions a deficit of 25 billion dinars instead of a planned 90 billion dinars. 

1. The actual deficit (25 billion) is indeed less than the planned deficit (90 billion).
2. The claim states that this is ""three and a half times less"" than what the IMF would be satisfied with. 

To check this, we can calculate:
- If the planned deficit is 90 billion dinars, then three and a half times that amount would be 90 billion / 3.5 = approximately 25.71 billion dinars. 

Since the actual deficit of 25 billion dinars is less than 25.71 billion dinars, the statement that the deficit is ""three and a half times less"" is not accurate in a strict mathematical sense, but it does convey that the deficit is significantly lower than the planned amount.

Given this analysis, the claim is mostly accurate but has a slight inaccuracy in the phrasing regarding the comparison to the IMF's expectations.
