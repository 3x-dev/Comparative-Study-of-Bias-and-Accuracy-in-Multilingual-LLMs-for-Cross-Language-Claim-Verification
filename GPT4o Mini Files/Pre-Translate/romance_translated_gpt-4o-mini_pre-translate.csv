As of the latest data available up to October 2023, Chile's per capita income is indeed around $26,000. However, Brazil's per capita income is significantly lower, but not quite half of Chile's. Brazil's per capita income is generally reported to be in the range of $12,000 to $15,000.

Given that $26,000 is more than double Brazil's per capita income, the claim is misleading. While it is true that Chile's per capita income is higher than Brazil's, the phrase ""almost double"" is an exaggeration.

2. The claim also compares this number to the total number of deaths in World War II for several countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Poland, Greece, and the Netherlands). The total military and civilian deaths in these countries during World War II is significantly higher than 800,000.

Given that the number of deaths in World War II for these countries combined is estimated to be in the millions, the comparison made in the claim is misleading.

Salvini has been a politician since Di Maio was first grade?,mostly true,it,"To evaluate the claim ""Salvini has been a politician since Di Maio was in first grade,"" we need to consider the timelines of both politicians.

Matteo Salvini began his political career in the early 1990s, while Luigi Di Maio was born in 1986. Assuming Di Maio was in first grade around the age of 6 (which would be around 1992), Salvini was indeed active in politics at that time.

Therefore, the claim is accurate in stating that Salvini has been a politician since Di Maio was in first grade.

1. The speaker claims to have delivered 295 day care centers.
2. The speaker states that Governor Márcio França delivered 18 more than that, which would total 313 centers delivered by him.
3. Additionally, the speaker mentions that Governor França has more than 200 centers under construction.

To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we would need to check the actual records of day care center deliveries and ongoing projects attributed to both the speaker and Governor França. If the numbers align with the claim, it would be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If they are significantly off, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Without specific data to confirm or refute these numbers, we cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the speaker's numbers are generally accurate and that the governor's additional centers and ongoing projects are also factual, we might lean towards 'Mostly True'.

A can of beer has fewer calories than a dose of caipirinha,true,pt,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the calorie content of a can of beer with that of a dose of caipirinha.

A standard can of beer (approximately 12 ounces) typically contains around 150 calories, though this can vary depending on the type of beer. 

A caipirinha, which is a cocktail made with cachaça, sugar, and lime, generally contains more calories due to the sugar content. A typical serving of caipirinha can have around 200-300 calories, depending on the amount of sugar used and the size of the drink.

Given this information, the claim that ""A can of beer has fewer calories than a dose of caipirinha"" is likely to be true, as a standard beer usually has fewer calories than a typical serving of caipirinha.
