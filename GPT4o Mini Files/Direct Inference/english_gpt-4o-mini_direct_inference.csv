"If you're earning under $100,000 a year and you commute to New York every day you pay more to the Port Authority in tolls than you pay to the state of New Jersey in income tax.",true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the tolls paid to the Port Authority for commuting to New York and the income tax paid to the state of New Jersey for someone earning under $100,000 a year.

1. **Tolls**: The tolls for commuting from New Jersey to New York can vary based on the specific bridge or tunnel used. For example, as of recent rates, a round trip toll for the George Washington Bridge is around $16 for cars. If someone commutes five days a week, that could amount to approximately $80 a week, or about $4,160 a year.

2. **New Jersey Income Tax**: New Jersey has a progressive income tax system. For someone earning under $100,000, the tax rate can range from 1.4% to 6.37%. For example, if someone earns $100,000, their income tax could be around $3,000 to $4,000 depending on deductions and specific tax brackets.

Given these estimates, it is plausible that the tolls paid to the Port Authority could exceed the income tax paid to New Jersey for someone earning under $100,000 a year, especially if they are commuting daily.

Based on this analysis, the claim appears to be accurate.

The Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years than the total number of tenured (UW) faculty fired during the last two decades.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two parts: the number of starting quarterbacks the Chicago Bears have had in the last 10 years and the number of tenured faculty fired at the University of Washington (UW) in the last two decades.

1. **Chicago Bears Starting Quarterbacks**: The Bears have had a significant turnover in their quarterback position over the last decade. As of 2023, they have had around 10 different starting quarterbacks since 2013.

2. **Tenured Faculty Fired at UW**: The number of tenured faculty members fired at UW over the last 20 years is relatively low. Reports indicate that the number is typically in the single digits, often cited as fewer than 10.

Given this information, the claim that the Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years than the total number of tenured faculty fired at UW in the last two decades appears to be accurate.

"Says New Jersey’s job growth in May represents ""25 percent of all the jobs created in the country.""",false,en,"To evaluate the claim that New Jersey’s job growth in May represents ""25 percent of all the jobs created in the country,"" we need to check the actual job growth figures for New Jersey and the total job growth in the United States for that month.

If New Jersey created a significant number of jobs in May, and that number is indeed 25 percent of the total jobs created in the U.S. for that month, then the claim would be true. However, if the actual percentage is lower or higher than 25 percent, the claim would be rated accordingly.

Without specific data from May regarding the number of jobs created in New Jersey and the total jobs created in the U.S., I cannot definitively assess the accuracy of the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate data, and New Jersey did indeed account for 25 percent of the job growth, then the claim would be ""True."" If it was less than that, it would be ""Mostly False"" or ""False,"" and if it was more, it would be ""Mostly True.""

Since I do not have the specific data to confirm or deny the claim, I will provide a cautious response.

We are one of only two states to have eight consecutive months of declining unemployment. Twenty-one states had increased unemployment last month. Ours went down.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two parts: 

1. Whether the state in question is indeed one of only two states with eight consecutive months of declining unemployment.
2. Whether twenty-one states had increased unemployment last month while the state in question's unemployment went down.

If both parts are accurate, the claim would be considered 'True'. If one part is accurate and the other is not, it could be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on which part is correct. If neither part is accurate, it would be 'False'.

Without specific data to confirm these statements, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and current data, it would likely be 'True'.

"Deficit spending ‘exploded during the Obama administration’ to $5.3 trillion over four years, compared to $2 trillion in eight years under President George W. Bush.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at the context of deficit spending during both the Obama and Bush administrations.

1. **Deficit Spending Under Obama**: The Obama administration (2009-2017) did indeed see significant deficit spending, particularly in the early years due to the financial crisis and the subsequent stimulus measures. The total deficit over his two terms was approximately $5.3 trillion.

2. **Deficit Spending Under Bush**: The George W. Bush administration (2001-2009) had a total deficit of about $2 trillion over his two terms. This includes the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as tax cuts.

3. **Comparison**: The claim states that deficit spending ""exploded"" during Obama's administration compared to Bush's. While it is true that the deficit was higher during Obama's presidency, the term ""exploded"" can be subjective. The increase in deficit spending was largely a response to the economic crisis and was part of recovery efforts.

Given this analysis, the claim is accurate in terms of the numbers presented but may be seen as somewhat misleading due to the context of the economic conditions that led to the increased spending.

We created as many jobs in the first six months of this year as we did in all of 2011 and 2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the job creation numbers from the first six months of the current year to the total job creation in 2011. If the job creation in the first half of the current year matches or exceeds the total for 2011, then the claim would be considered true. 

If 2011 was indeed the best year for private-sector job growth since 2000, we would also need to verify that the job growth in 2011 was higher than in any other year from 2000 to the present.

Without specific data on job creation numbers for the first six months of the current year and the total for 2011, I cannot definitively assess the accuracy of the claim. However, if the statement is based on accurate data, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

Given the context and typical job growth trends, I would lean towards the claim being 'Mostly True', assuming the numbers are close but not exact.

$16 trillion (the national debt) in $1 bills would cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times.,true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to calculate the area that $16 trillion in $1 bills would cover and compare it to the area of Ohio.

1. **Area of Ohio**: Ohio has an area of approximately 44,825 square miles.

2. **Size of a $1 bill**: A U.S. $1 bill measures about 2.61 inches by 6.14 inches, which is approximately 0.0111 square meters (or 0.0000111 square kilometers).

3. **Total area covered by $16 trillion in $1 bills**:
   - $16 trillion is 16,000,000,000,000 $1 bills.
   - The total area covered by these bills would be:
     \[
     16,000,000,000,000 \text{ bills} \times 0.0000111 \text{ km}^2/\text{bill} \approx 177,600 \text{ km}^2
     \]

4. **Convert km² to mi²**: 
   - 1 square kilometer is approximately 0.386102 square miles.
   - Therefore, the area in square miles is:
     \[
     177,600 \text{ km}^2 \times 0.386102 \text{ mi}^2/\text{km}^2 \approx 68,800 \text{ mi}^2
     \]

5. **Comparison**:
   - The area of Ohio is about 44,825 square miles.
   - The area covered by $16 trillion in $1 bills is approximately 68,800 square miles.
   - This means that $16 trillion in $1 bills would cover Ohio about 1.54 times (68,800 / 44,825).

Since the claim states that it would cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times, this is accurate.

"To give the proposed economic stimulus plan some perspective, ""if you started the day Jesus Christ was born and spent $1 million every day since then, you still wouldn’t have spent $1 trillion.""",true,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to calculate how many days have passed since the birth of Jesus Christ, which is traditionally dated to around 1 AD. 

Assuming Jesus was born in 1 AD, as of 2023, that would be approximately 2023 years. 

Calculating the total number of days:
- 2023 years * 365 days/year = 738395 days
- Adding leap years (approximately 1 leap year every 4 years): 2023 / 4 = about 505 leap years
- Total days = 738395 + 505 = 738900 days (approximately)

Now, if you spend $1 million every day for 738900 days:
- Total spent = 738900 days * $1,000,000/day = $738,900,000,000 (or $738.9 billion)

Since $738.9 billion is significantly less than $1 trillion, the claim that you wouldn't have spent $1 trillion is accurate.
