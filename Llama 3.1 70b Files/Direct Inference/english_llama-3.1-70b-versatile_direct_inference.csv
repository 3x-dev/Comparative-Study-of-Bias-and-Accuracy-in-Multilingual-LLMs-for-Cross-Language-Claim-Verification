"Says Andrew Gillum has a ""far left socialist platform.""",false,en,"To accurately assess the claim that Andrew Gillum has a ""far left socialist platform,"" we would need to evaluate the specific policies he has advocated for and compare them to common understandings of what constitutes ""far left"" and ""socialist"" political stances.

1. **Definition of Terms**: First, it's crucial to define what ""far left"" and ""socialist"" mean in a political context. The ""far left"" is often associated with progressive or radical social and economic policies that seek significant changes to the existing political, social, and economic structures. Socialism, on the other hand, involves economic and political theories that emphasize the need for public or collective ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange.

2. ** PLATFORM ANALYSIS**: Andrew Gillum, a Democrat, has been noted for progressive policies, such as advocating for Medicare for All, increasing the minimum wage, improving access to higher education, and combating climate change through transitioning to renewable energy sources. While these policies can be seen as progressive, whether they are ""far left"" or ""socialist"" depends on the lens through which they are viewed.

3. **Medicare for All**: Some might view advocating for a universal healthcare system as ""socialist,"" as it aligns with principles of public provision of essential services. However, international context and precedent for public healthcare systems are varied, and the term ""socialist"" might be more appropriately used in systems that fundamentally alter private property rights.

4. **Economic and Social Justice Advocacy**: Gillum's advocacy on issues like increasing the minimum wage and improving access to education reflect standard progressive Democratic views rather than necessarily ""far left"" or ""socialist"" stances.

Given this analysis, while Andrew Gillum has certainly advocated for progressive policies, labeling his platform as ""far left socialist"" might be more of an interpretation than an objective fact. Some policies may align with socialist ideas, but the characterization of his entire platform as ""far left socialist"" could be seen as somewhat overstated or exaggerated based on standard definitions.
