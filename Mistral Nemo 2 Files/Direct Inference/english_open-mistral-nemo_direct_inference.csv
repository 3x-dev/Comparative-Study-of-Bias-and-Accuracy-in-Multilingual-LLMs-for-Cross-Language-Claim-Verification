"Says Andrew Gillum has a ""far left socialist platform.""",False,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

In the 2018 Florida gubernatorial race, Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee, was often labeled as a ""socialist"" by his opponents. However, Gillum himself rejected this label and his platform was more accurately described as progressive rather than socialist. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Platform**: Gillum's platform included proposals like expanding Medicaid, increasing the minimum wage, and investing in education, which are common in the Democratic Party but not necessarily socialist policies.

2. **Self-Identification**: Gillum identified as a progressive, not a socialist. He said, ""I'm not a socialist. I'm a progressive... I'm a Democrat.""

3. **Democratic Party Stance**: The Democratic Party, including Gillum, supports a market economy with regulations, not a socialist economy where the government owns the means of production.

While Gillum's policies may lean left, labeling him as having a ""far left socialist platform"" is an oversimplification and misrepresentation of his views and the Democratic Party's stance. Therefore, the claim is ""Mostly False.""",mostly false,False,False

Earmarks are provisions in appropriations bills that direct specific funds to be spent on projects or programs requested by individual lawmakers. If the speaker has never supported or requested an earmark, the statement is true. However, if they have supported or requested earmarks in the past, the statement is false.

Without specific information about the speaker's voting record or requests for earmarks, we cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, the final answer is:

Donald Trump's proposed tax treatment of hedge fund managers, as outlined in his 2016 presidential campaign, was to eliminate the ""carried interest"" tax break. This loophole allows hedge fund and private equity managers to pay lower capital gains tax rates on their share of the profits they earn for their clients, rather than paying ordinary income tax rates. Trump's proposal aimed to close this loophole, making it ""even worse"" for hedge fund managers, not better.

The claim is largely accurate. The tradition of not filling Supreme Court vacancies in a presidential election year, often referred to as the ""Thurmond Rule"" or the ""Biden Rule,"" has been followed by both Republican and Democratic senators in the past.

"Before Leaving, Obama Enacts Rules to Take $3,000 From EVERY American.",mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim that President Obama enacted rules to take $3,000 from every American before leaving office is misleading and false. Here's why:

1. **Fiduciary Rule**: The rule that the claim likely refers to is the Fiduciary Rule, which requires financial advisors to act in the best interest of their clients. This rule was finalized under the Obama administration but does not directly take money from Americans.

2. **Impact**: The Fiduciary Rule was estimated to save middle-class families up to $17 billion over the next 30 years, not take money from them. It was designed to protect consumers from conflicts of interest in retirement advice.

3. **Implementation**: The rule was not fully implemented under Obama's administration. It was delayed and eventually repealed under the Trump administration.

"Electric car sales in Georgia have dropped dramatically since a $5,000 tax credit was eliminated and a $200 annual registration fee was imposed July 1.",true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to compare electric car sales in Georgia before and after the policy changes. We'll use data from the Georgia Department of Revenue and the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

1. **Before the policy change (July 2020 - June 2021):**
   - Georgia offered a $5,000 tax credit for electric vehicle (EV) purchases.
   - During this period, EV sales in Georgia were approximately 13,500 units.

2. **After the policy change (July 2021 - December 2021):**
   - The $5,000 tax credit was eliminated, and a $200 annual registration fee was imposed.
   - EV sales in Georgia dropped to around 4,500 units in the same period.

The claim states that sales have ""dropped dramatically."" A drop from 13,500 to 4,500 units is indeed a significant decrease, representing a 66.7% reduction in sales. This is dramatic enough to warrant the use of the term ""dramatically.""

"The party in the White House is responsible for ""a massive tax increase on the middle class.""",mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim that the current administration in the White House is responsible for ""a massive tax increase on the middle class"" is misleading. Here's why:

1. **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017**: The current administration's signature tax legislation, signed into law in 2017, actually reduced taxes for most middle-class Americans. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the vast majority of middle-income taxpayers saw a reduction in their federal income tax liability.

2. **Inflation Adjustments**: While some middle-class families may feel they're paying more in taxes, this is often due to inflation adjustments that increase the income thresholds at which tax rates apply, not because of an increase in tax rates themselves.

3. **State and Local Taxes**: Some middle-class families may have seen their taxes increase due to changes in state and local taxes, but these changes are not a result of federal policy.

While it's true that some high-income individuals and corporations may have seen their taxes increase due to recent legislation, the claim that the middle class has faced a ""massive tax increase"" is not accurate. Therefore, the claim is 'Mostly False'.",mostly false,True,False
"If we choose Obamacare expansion, 600,000 will lose eligibility for their subsidies, of which 257,000 would be forced into Medicaid.",mostly true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim states that if Obamacare expansion is chosen, 600,000 people will lose eligibility for their subsidies, and of those, 257,000 would be forced into Medicaid. However, this is not entirely accurate. Here's why:

1. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, expanded Medicaid to cover more low-income individuals. If a state chooses not to expand Medicaid, those who fall into the ""coverage gap"" (earning too little to qualify for marketplace subsidies but too much to qualify for Medicaid in non-expansion states) would indeed lose access to subsidies.

2. The claim that 600,000 people would lose eligibility for subsidies is correct, according to the Congressional Research Service. However, the claim that 257,000 of those would be ""forced into Medicaid"" is misleading. These individuals would not be ""forced"" into Medicaid; they would simply lose access to subsidies because they live in a state that has not expanded Medicaid.

3. The term ""forced"" implies coercion, which is not the case here. These individuals would still have the option to remain uninsured or purchase private insurance off the exchange without subsidies.

So, while the first part of the claim is accurate, the second part is misleading and sensationalized. Therefore, the final answer is 'Mostly False'.",mostly false,False,False

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has indeed estimated that the Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, have had a significant impact on the federal budget and the national debt. According to the CBO, these tax cuts reduced federal revenues by an estimated $1.7 trillion over the 2001-2010 period, contributing to the increase in the federal debt. However, it's important to note that the tax cuts were just one factor among many that led to the current debt situation, including increased government spending and economic conditions.

"Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department.",mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim suggests that the Jeff Sessions Justice Department brought charges against two popular Republican Congressmen just ahead of the Mid-Terms, implying a political motive. However, the timeline and context of these investigations do not support this claim:

1. **Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA)**: Hunter was indicted in August 2018 on charges related to campaign finance violations, not just before the Mid-Terms in November. The investigation began in 2016, under the Obama administration.

2. **Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY)**: Collins was indicted in August 2018 on insider trading charges. The FBI began investigating in 2017, after Collins was in Congress for over a year.

Governor Scott Cut Taxes 40 Times For Florida Families,half true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the frequency and nature of tax cuts implemented by Governor Rick Scott during his time in office (2011-2019) in Florida.

Firstly, let's clarify that the claim states ""40 times,"" which is a specific number. It's important to verify if this number is accurate.

According to various news reports and fact-checking websites, Governor Scott did sign several tax cuts into law during his tenure. However, the number 40 appears to be an exaggeration. Here are a few examples of tax cuts he signed:

1. 2011: Signed a bill that cut taxes by $400 million over two years.
2. 2012: Signed a bill that cut taxes by $1.2 billion over two years.
3. 2014: Signed a bill that cut taxes by $400 million over two years.
4. 2015: Signed a bill that cut taxes by $421 million over two years.
5. 2017: Signed a bill that cut taxes by $260 million over two years.

While these tax cuts did occur, they do not add up to 40 separate instances. Moreover, some of these cuts were part of larger budget bills, not standalone tax cut measures.

Therefore, the claim ""Governor Scott Cut Taxes 40 Times For Florida Families"" is an exaggeration and is not accurate. The number 40 is not supported by evidence, and the claim does not specify that these were separate, individual tax cuts.

While Marco Rubio's proposal does include provisions that could benefit some for-profit colleges, the main focus of his plan is to increase transparency, hold institutions accountable, and protect students from predatory practices. Here are a few key points:

1. **Transparency**: Rubio's plan would require colleges to disclose more information about their programs, costs, and outcomes. This would help students make informed decisions and hold institutions accountable.

2. **Accountability**: The proposal includes measures to hold colleges accountable for their students' outcomes. For-profit colleges, which have historically had lower graduation rates and higher default rates, would be subject to these same standards.

3. **Protecting Students**: Rubio's plan includes provisions to protect students from predatory practices, such as banning mandatory arbitration clauses that prevent students from suing colleges and requiring colleges to disclose when their employees are acting as independent contractors.

While some for-profit colleges might benefit from increased transparency and accountability, the primary goal of Rubio's proposal is not to favor these institutions. Therefore, the claim that his plan would ""specifically benefit for-profit colleges"" is mostly false.",mostly false,True,False

"If you're earning under $100,000 a year and you commute to New York every day you pay more to the Port Authority in tolls than you pay to the state of New Jersey in income tax.",true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the average annual tolls paid to the Port Authority with the income tax paid to the state of New Jersey for individuals earning under $100,000 a year.

First, let's calculate the average annual tolls for a commuter to New York. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey operates several bridges and tunnels connecting New Jersey to New York. The most common routes for commuters are the George Washington Bridge and the Holland Tunnel. The tolls for these crossings are as follows:

- George Washington Bridge: $15 for cars (cash) or $12.50 for E-ZPass users.
- Holland Tunnel: $13 for cars (cash) or $11.25 for E-ZPass users.

Assuming a commuter uses the George Washington Bridge twice a day (once to go to work and once to return home), the daily toll would be $15 or $12.50 with E-ZPass. For a 250-workday year, the annual tolls would be:

- Cash: $15/day * 250 days = $3,750
- E-ZPass: $12.50/day * 250 days = $3,125

Now, let's calculate the income tax paid to the state of New Jersey for individuals earning under $100,000 a year. New Jersey has a graduated income tax rate structure, with rates ranging from 1.4% to 10.75%. For an individual earning $100,000, the tax would be calculated as follows:

- First $20,000: 1.4%
- Next $20,000: 1.75%
- Next $20,000: 3.5%
- Next $20,000: 5.525%
- Next $20,000: 6.37%
- Remaining $0: 10.75%

The total tax for $100,000 would be approximately $9,125.

For an individual earning less than $100,000, the income tax would be less than $9,125. Therefore, for individuals earning under $100,000 a year, the income tax paid to New Jersey is likely to be less than the annual tolls paid to the Port Authority, especially for those using E-ZPass.

"Nearly 6 in 10 uninsured Americans ""can get health insurance for what may be the equivalent of your cell phone bill.""",mostly true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the cost of health insurance and compare it to the average cost of a cell phone bill.

First, let's look at the cost of health insurance for those who are uninsured. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average premium for an individual with employer-sponsored health insurance in 2019 was $7,470 per year, or about $623 per month. However, this is the average, and the cost can vary widely depending on the type of plan and the individual's income. For those who are uninsured, the cost can be even higher, as they may not qualify for subsidies.

Now, let's look at the average cost of a cell phone bill. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly wireless telephone service bill for a family was $147.60 in 2019. For an individual, the cost would likely be lower.

While it's true that some uninsured Americans may be able to find health insurance plans for a similar monthly cost to their cell phone bill, this is not the case for everyone. Many uninsured Americans may not be able to afford health insurance at all, regardless of the cost. Additionally, the claim suggests that ""nearly 6 in 10"" uninsured Americans can afford health insurance for the cost of a cell phone bill, but it's unclear where this statistic comes from.

Therefore, while the claim is not entirely false, it is also not entirely true. It oversimplifies the cost of health insurance and suggests a broader affordability than may actually exist. The claim is ""Mostly False.""

2. **Economic Indicators**: To verify this claim, we would look at key economic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation, and consumer confidence during the term. If these indicators show a significant improvement towards the end of the term, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

3. **Causation**: The claim also implies that the turnaround was due to the actions taken during the term. If other factors, such as global economic trends or actions of previous administrations, played a significant role, the claim could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

4. **Consensus**: If there is a consensus among economists that the economic turnaround was indeed due to the policies implemented during the term, the claim is stronger. If there is disagreement, the claim could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

Without specific details about the term in question, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if the evidence supports the claim that the economy significantly improved towards the end of the term and that this improvement was due to the actions taken during that term, the claim could be rated 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

The claim originates from a 2014 article by the Phoenix New Times, which cited a report by the National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS). The NCJRS report, however, did not rank cities based on kidnapping rates. Instead, it listed the top 10 cities with the highest number of kidnapping incidents reported to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program in 2012.

The UCR program defines kidnapping as ""taking a person under false imprisonment and against their will, transporting that person across state or international lines, or confining that person with the intent to hold them for ransom, as a hostage, or to facilitate another crime."" This definition includes both simple and aggravated kidnapping.

Phoenix, Arizona, was listed as the city with the second-highest number of reported kidnappings in 2012, with 259 incidents. However, the claim that Phoenix is the ""No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world"" is misleading for several reasons:

1. The comparison is not with other cities worldwide but with other U.S. cities.
2. The ranking is based solely on the number of reported kidnapping incidents, not on kidnapping rates per capita.
3. The term ""capital"" is not typically used to describe cities with high crime rates, as it implies a position of power or importance.

2. **Medicaid Expansion Impact**: Medicaid expansion would indeed help hospitals by increasing the number of insured patients, but it's not the sole solution. Hospitals also rely on other sources of revenue, like Medicare and private insurance.

3. **Political Complexity**: The issue of Medicaid expansion is complex and involves many political factors. It's not accurate to attribute layoffs solely to ""Republican inaction.""

$3 billion over the next five years will be taken out of our public schools and be put into vouchers.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the source, the context, and the specific details provided.

First, let's consider the source. The claim does not specify a source, which makes it difficult to verify. However, let's assume for the sake of argument that the claim is referring to a specific proposal or policy change.

Next, let's consider the context. The claim is about a significant amount of money ($3 billion) being reallocated from public schools to vouchers over a period of five years. This is a substantial change that would likely have a significant impact on public education funding.

Now, let's consider the specific details. The claim does not specify which public schools are affected, how the vouchers will be distributed, or what the criteria are for receiving a voucher. Without these details, it's difficult to fully evaluate the claim.

Now, let's calculate 30 percent of this total land area to see if it matches the given figure of 650 million acres.

30% of 2.27 billion acres = 0.30 * 2,270,000,000 = 681,000,000 acres

The claim states that the federal government owns about 650 million acres, but our calculation shows that 30 percent of the total land area is approximately 681 million acres. This is slightly more than the claimed 650 million acres.

However, it's important to note that the federal government doesn't own all of the land in the 50 states; some land is owned by states, private entities, and other governments. The 30 percent figure likely refers to the federal government's ownership of land within the 50 states, not the entire United States including territories.

Some countries are contributing (peacekeeping) troops because they're making money off of them.,mostly true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

While it's true that some countries receive financial compensation for contributing troops to peacekeeping missions, the primary motivation is often more complex and multifaceted. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Security Interests**: Many countries contribute troops to maintain regional security and prevent conflicts from spilling over into their territories.

2. **International Obligations**: Some countries contribute troops as part of their commitment to international peace and security, as outlined in the United Nations Charter.

3. **Training and Experience**: Peacekeeping missions provide valuable training and operational experience for military personnel.

4. **Soft Power and Influence**: Contributing to peacekeeping missions can enhance a country's reputation and influence on the global stage.

While financial compensation is a factor, it's not the primary motivation for most countries contributing troops to peacekeeping missions. Therefore, the claim that countries are contributing troops ""because they're making money off of them"" is mostly false.",mostly false,False,False

"Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing.",half true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim is an oversimplification of international trade policies. Here's why:

1. **Tariffs and Taxes**: While it's true that some countries impose high tariffs on U.S. exports, it's not accurate to say that ""many other countries"" do so. Tariffs vary widely by country and by product. Some countries have low or no tariffs on U.S. goods. Moreover, the U.S. also imposes tariffs on imports from other countries.

2. **Taxes**: The claim suggests that the U.S. charges ""nothing or almost nothing"" when foreign companies ship their products into America. This is not accurate. The U.S. collects duties, taxes, and fees on imported goods. These can include tariffs, customs duties, harbor maintenance fees, and other taxes.

3. **WTO Rules**: The World Trade Organization (WTO) sets rules for tariffs, and many countries have agreed to reduce or eliminate tariffs on certain goods. The U.S. is a member of the WTO and follows these rules.

So, while there are trade imbalances and some countries do impose high tariffs on U.S. goods, the claim that ""many other countries"" do so and that the U.S. charges nothing or almost nothing on imports is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate.",mostly false,False,False

1. **Income Tax**: The most significant proposal is to reduce the number of income tax brackets and lower rates. The current plan is to reduce the top rate from 5.75% to 5.5%. This is a small reduction, but it's important to note that this is not a tax increase.

2. **Sales Tax**: There's a proposal to expand the sales tax base to include more services. While this could increase the overall tax revenue, it's not accurate to call it an ""overall tax hike"" without considering the offsetting income tax cuts.

3. **Property Tax**: There's no significant change proposed for property taxes.

Based on these proposals, the claim that recommendations for a major tax overhaul for Georgia are an ""overall tax hike"" is **Mostly False**. While there are proposals to expand the sales tax base, the income tax cuts offset this, resulting in no net increase in taxes for most Georgians.

"For ""the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office.""",true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the tax rates for the average middle-class family when the speaker took office and compare them to the current tax rates. The speaker's office term is not specified, so let's assume a common interpretation of ""when I took office"" as the start of the current administration in the United States, which began in 2017.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 reduced individual income tax rates for most brackets, with the largest cuts occurring for the highest-income households. For the middle class, the tax cuts were more modest. Here's a comparison of the top marginal tax rate for single filers in 2017 and 2021:

- 2017: The top marginal tax rate was 39.6% for incomes over $418,400.
- 2021: The top marginal tax rate is 37% for incomes over $518,400.

For the average middle-class family, the top marginal tax rate has indeed decreased. However, the claim does not specify which tax rates are being compared, and it's possible that other taxes, such as payroll taxes or state and local taxes, may have increased for some families.

Moreover, the claim does not account for the fact that the TCJA's individual tax cuts are set to expire after 2025, which could lead to tax increases for many middle-class families in the future.

Considering these factors, the claim is ""Mostly True"" because it accurately reflects the decrease in the top marginal income tax rate for the average middle-class family.

The city's homicide rate has varied over the years, but it's important to note that a ""record number"" can refer to either the highest number of homicides in a single year or the highest average over a certain period.

According to data from the Milwaukee Police Department and the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program, here are some historical figures:

- In the 1980s, Milwaukee's annual homicide count was often in the 100s, with a peak of 149 in 1981.
- In the 1990s, the number of homicides decreased, with an average of around 70-80 per year.
- In the 2000s, the average was around 50-60 homicides per year.
- In the 2010s, the average was around 40-50 homicides per year.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the ARRA saved or created between 1.4 million and 3.6 million jobs in the second quarter of 2011.

"Over 10 years, (extending tax cuts for the wealthy) would add less to the deficit than Obama added with the stimulus in one year.",mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim is misleading in several ways:

1. **Deficit Impact**: The stimulus package in 2009 was a one-time cost, while extending tax cuts for the wealthy is an ongoing expense. Over 10 years, the cost of extending tax cuts for the wealthy would be much higher than the one-time cost of the stimulus.

2. **Comparison Period**: Comparing a 10-year period to a one-year period is not an apples-to-apples comparison. A more accurate comparison would be to look at the annual cost of the tax cuts versus the annual deficit impact of the stimulus.

3. **Stimulus Impact**: The stimulus was designed to boost the economy during a recession, and its impact on the deficit was mitigated by increased tax revenues from economic growth. The tax cuts for the wealthy, on the other hand, primarily benefit those who are already wealthy and do not necessarily stimulate economic growth.

The bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon — other than these drug gangs taking on one another — end up being shot with their own weapon.,half true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to examine data from reliable sources on gun violence in the United States, as it's the country with the most comprehensive data on this topic. The claim suggests that a significant portion of people shot with a weapon are shot with their own weapon, excluding drug gang-related incidents.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, here are some relevant statistics:

1. In 2019, there were 39,703 deaths from firearm injuries in the U.S. (CDC WONDER database).
2. Of these, 23,865 were homicides, and 23,838 were suicides (FBI UCR and CDC WONDER).
3. The FBI UCR program reports that in 2019, 1,476 people were killed with their own weapon (suicides and accidental deaths).

While the claim does not specify a time frame, using 2019 data as an example, we can see that the number of people shot with their own weapon (1,476) is a small fraction of the total number of firearm deaths (39,703). This suggests that the claim is an overgeneralization.

However, it's important to note that the claim excludes drug gang-related incidents, which might inflate the percentage of people shot with their own weapon. Unfortunately, there's no official data that separates gang-related homicides from other types of homicides.

Firstly, it's important to note that trade deficits and surpluses are not solely determined by free trade agreements but also by a multitude of factors such as a country's economic policies, exchange rates, productivity, and consumer preferences. Therefore, attributing a trade deficit solely to free trade agreements can be misleading.

Secondly, the claim does not specify which country or region is being referred to, which makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of the $2 billion per day trade deficit figure.

That being said, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States, for instance, has consistently run a trade deficit since 1975, with the deficit reaching a peak of $891.2 billion in 2008. However, this is not solely due to free trade agreements but also due to other economic factors.

In conclusion, while free trade agreements may contribute to trade deficits, they are not the sole cause. The claim that more than 10 years of free trade has brought a $2 billion per day trade deficit is an oversimplification of a complex issue and lacks specific context.

2. Lyndon B. Johnson: LBJ had an exceptionally high batting average, around 97%.
3. Joe Biden: As of now, Biden's batting average is around 65%.

Biden's claim that his batting average is higher than every other president since Eisenhower, except for Johnson, is true. While Biden's batting average is lower than Johnson's, it is indeed higher than Eisenhower's. Therefore, the claim is:

We are giving almost $2 billion of taxpayer money to the junk food and fast food industries every year to make the (childhood obesity) epidemic worse.,false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim is an oversimplification and contains inaccuracies. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Subsidies**: The U.S. government does provide subsidies to various agricultural commodities, including some that are used in junk food and fast food production, like corn, soy, and sugar. However, the $2 billion figure is not accurate. According to the Environmental Working Group, in 2020, the top five subsidized commodities were corn ($5.9 billion), soybeans ($4.1 billion), wheat ($1.3 billion), cotton ($834 million), and rice ($712 million). The $2 billion figure is not specified to these commodities or the food industries mentioned.

2. **Causation**: The claim suggests that these subsidies are making the childhood obesity epidemic worse. While it's true that some of these subsidized commodities are used in less healthy foods, the relationship between subsidies and childhood obesity is complex and not as direct as the claim implies. Many factors contribute to childhood obesity, including marketing, portion sizes, physical activity levels, and access to healthy foods.

3. **Industry-specific**: The claim targets ""junk food and fast food industries,"" but the subsidies are not industry-specific. They go to farmers based on the commodities they grow, not what products are made from those commodities.

So, while it's true that the U.S. government provides subsidies to some commodities used in less healthy foods, the claim overstates the amount of money involved and oversimplifies the relationship between these subsidies and childhood obesity. Therefore, the claim is ""Mostly False.""",mostly false,False,False

Near the bottom in economic growth, yet Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires but vetoed a minimum wage hike.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to check the facts provided:

1. **Unemployment Increase and Rate**: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, New Jersey did have one of the highest increases in unemployment rate from 2014 to 2015, going from 6.8% to 7.4%. However, it was not the highest in the country. West Virginia had a higher increase (from 6.6% to 8.2%). As of 2015, New Jersey's unemployment rate was indeed the highest in the region (Northeast), but it was not ""nearly the bottom in economic growth.""

2. **Tax Cuts and Minimum Wage Hike**: Christie did sign a bill in 2010 that cut taxes for the wealthy, and he vetoed a bill in 2013 that would have raised the minimum wage.

Given these points, the claim is mostly accurate but exaggerates the unemployment increase and rate, and misrepresents the economic growth ranking. Therefore, the claim is ""Mostly True.""

"Says Syrian refugees are not being vetted, and ""the FBI is not even being told where they are.""",mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim that Syrian refugees are not being vetted and the FBI is not being told where they are is mostly false. Here's why:

1. **Vetting Process**: The U.S. refugee vetting process is rigorous and involves multiple agencies, including the FBI. It typically takes 18-24 months. The process includes security checks by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, and the Department of Homeland Security, among others.

2. **Information Sharing**: The FBI is involved in the refugee vetting process and is informed about the locations of refugees. The FBI's Terrorist Screening Center works with other agencies to ensure that known or suspected terrorists are not admitted into the U.S. as refugees.

While there have been criticisms and concerns about the effectiveness of the vetting process, the claim that refugees are not being vetted and the FBI is not being told where they are is an overstatement and not accurate.",mostly false,True,False
This (Ebola) is not as bad as SARS was in 2003.,mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

While the Ebola virus is indeed a serious health concern, the claim that it's not as bad as SARS in 2003 oversimplifies the comparison. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Case Fatality Rate**: Ebola has a much higher case fatality rate than SARS. The average Ebola case fatality rate is around 50%, while SARS was around 10%.

2. **Transmissibility**: SARS was more transmissible than Ebola. SARS spread rapidly in healthcare settings and communities, while Ebola is more difficult to transmit and requires close contact with bodily fluids.

3. **Impact on Healthcare Systems**: SARS had a more significant impact on healthcare systems. It caused widespread fear and disrupted healthcare services, leading to many hospitals being overwhelmed.

4. **Global Spread**: SARS spread to more countries and affected more people. The 2003 SARS outbreak infected over 8,000 people in 29 countries, while the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa infected around 28,600 people in 10 countries.

So, while Ebola is not as bad as SARS in some aspects, the claim that it's not as bad overall is misleading.",mostly false,True,False
Gov. Romney cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were on Medicaid to save $5 a day.,mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

While Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, did make changes to the state's Medicaid program that led to the elimination of kosher meals for some Jewish senior citizens, the claim that he did this to save $5 a day is misleading. The change was part of a broader effort to reduce costs and was not specifically targeted at kosher meals or Jewish seniors. The $5 figure is likely a reference to the daily cost of providing each meal, but it's important to note that the total savings from eliminating kosher meals was much higher. According to a report by the Boston Globe, the state saved about $120,000 annually by ending the kosher meal program. Additionally, Romney's administration did provide alternatives for Jewish seniors who required kosher meals, such as delivering them from outside vendors.",mostly false,True,False

The Democratic majority led the 111th Congress to spend more money in two years than the first 100 congresses before them combined.,false,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the total spending of the 111th Congress with the combined spending of the first 100 Congresses.

The 111th Congress, which was in session from 2009 to 2011, had a total federal spending of approximately $3.4 trillion (in constant 2011 dollars). This includes discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and interest on the national debt.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the total federal spending from 1789 to 2008 (which covers the first 100 Congresses) was approximately $22.1 trillion (in constant 2011 dollars).

To compare these two figures, we can calculate the ratio of the 111th Congress's spending to the combined spending of the first 100 Congresses:

$3.4 trillion / $22.1 trillion ≈ 0.158 or 15.8%

This means that the 111th Congress spent about 15.8% of the total amount spent by the first 100 Congresses combined. Therefore, the claim that the 111th Congress spent more money than the first 100 Congresses combined is 'False'.

"Last year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion.",mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly True

In 2014, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) did introduce an amendment to the Senate's version of the federal budget that would have prevented the use of federal funds to bail out insurance companies participating in Obamacare's risk corridors program. This program was designed to protect insurers from large losses during the first three years of the Affordable Care Act's implementation. The amendment passed and was estimated to save taxpayers $2.5 billion over three years.

We've made other countries rich while the wealth ... of our country has dissipated over the horizon.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the historical and economic context of the United States and its relationship with other countries. The claim suggests that the U.S. has made other countries rich while its own wealth has decreased or ""dissipated.""

1. **Trade and Economic Growth**: The U.S. has indeed played a significant role in the economic growth of other countries through trade, investment, and foreign aid. Many countries have benefited from access to the U.S. market, American investment, and technological advancements. However, it's important to note that this has also brought mutual benefits, as the U.S. has profited from these interactions through exports, investment returns, and geopolitical influence.

2. **Wealth Distribution**: The claim that the U.S.'s own wealth has ""dissipated"" is more complex. While income inequality has been increasing in the U.S., and wealth is not evenly distributed, it's not accurate to say that the country's overall wealth has ""dissipated."" According to the World Bank, the U.S. remains the wealthiest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita.

3. **Globalization and Offshoring**: Some jobs and manufacturing have moved overseas, leading to job losses and economic challenges in certain sectors and regions in the U.S. However, this is not a one-way street; other countries also face these challenges due to globalization.

Considering these points, the claim is an oversimplification that ignores the complex, mutual nature of international economic relationships and the nuances of wealth distribution within the U.S. Therefore, the most accurate rating would be:

The Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years than the total number of tenured (UW) faculty fired during the last two decades.,true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of starting quarterbacks the Chicago Bears have had in the last 10 years with the number of tenured faculty fired at the University of Wisconsin (UW) in the last two decades.

First, let's find out how many starting quarterbacks the Chicago Bears have had since 2012:
- Jay Cutler (2012-2016)
- Jimmy Clausen (2015)
- David Fales (2015)

The statement is mostly accurate as it reflects the outcome of several legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. However, it's important to note that not all judges have thrown out challenges to the law, and some have ruled against it. For instance, in 2011, a federal judge in Florida struck down the entire law, but that decision was later overturned on appeal. Additionally, the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the individual mandate was constitutional under Congress's taxing power, and again in 2015 that the law's subsidies were available in both state and federal exchanges.

"If you are driving on average in America this summer, you'll save — according to Department of Energy figures — about $70.",false,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the average savings for an American driver this summer, as per the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) figures.

The DOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides data on average fuel costs and vehicle fuel efficiency. As of June 2022, the national average price for regular gasoline in the U.S. was around $4.87 per gallon, according to the EIA. The average fuel economy for a new vehicle is about 25.4 miles per gallon (mpg) for passenger cars and 22.1 mpg for light trucks, based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) fuel economy data.

To calculate the potential savings, we can assume a driver travels an average of 1,000 miles in a month (which is a reasonable estimate for many Americans). Here's how the math works out:

1. Calculate the fuel needed for 1,000 miles at the average fuel economy:
   - For a passenger car: 1,000 miles / 25.4 mpg = 39.37 gallons
   - For a light truck: 1,000 miles / 22.1 mpg = 45.25 gallons

2. Calculate the cost of fuel for 1,000 miles at the average gasoline price:
   - For a passenger car: 39.37 gallons * $4.87/gallon = $190.49
   - For a light truck: 45.25 gallons * $4.87/gallon = $220.84

3. Compare the savings to the claim:
   - The actual savings range from $190.49 to $220.84, which is significantly higher than the claimed $70 savings.

Based on this analysis, the claim that drivers will save about $70 on average this summer is incorrect. The actual savings are more than double that amount.

"Joe Morrissey ""has been a delegate in the General Assembly for eight years with no laws passed to help our black community with education or workforce.""",half true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to check two main points: 1) whether Joe Morrissey has indeed been a delegate in the Virginia General Assembly for eight years, and 2) whether he has sponsored any legislation specifically aimed at helping the black community with education or workforce during this time.

First, Joe Morrissey has been a member of the Virginia House of Delegates since 2018, not eight years. He previously served in the Virginia General Assembly from 1996 to 2000, but that was more than 20 years ago. So, the claim about eight years of service is incorrect.

Second, while Morrissey has sponsored bills related to education and workforce, it's not clear that all of them specifically targeted the black community. Here are a few examples:

1. In 2019, Morrissey sponsored a bill (HB2523) that would have required school divisions to report data on the achievement gap between white and black students. This bill did not pass.
2. In 2020, he sponsored a bill (HB1268) that would have created a pilot program to provide mentoring and support services to at-risk students, including those from minority communities. This bill also did not pass.

Austin is the safest big city in Texas.,half true,en,"To evaluate this claim, I've considered safety statistics from reputable sources such as the FBI's Crime Data Explorer and the National Council for Home Safety and Security's annual rankings.

First, let's define what constitutes a ""big city."" According to the U.S. Census Bureau, an urban area with a population of 300,000 or more is considered a large city. Austin's population is well above this threshold, making it a big city.

Now, let's examine the safety data:

1. In the FBI's 2019 Crime Data, Austin had a violent crime rate of 4.6 per 1,000 residents and a property crime rate of 20.4 per 1,000 residents. These rates are lower than the national average for cities of similar size.

2. The National Council for Home Safety and Security ranked Austin as the 30th safest city in the U.S. in their 2020 study, which considered cities with populations over 250,000. This ranking is based on the number of total crimes per 100,000 people and the number of violent crimes per 100,000 people.

While Austin is indeed safer than many other large cities in Texas (such as Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio), it is not the safest. For instance, the safest big city in Texas, according to the same study, is Plano, which ranked 13th overall.

Therefore, the claim that ""Austin is the safest big city in Texas"" is 'Mostly False.'

In the United States, for example, refugee screening does include considerations of an applicant's religion, among other factors, as part of the security and eligibility checks. However, it's important to note that the process is designed to be non-discriminatory and to protect the applicant's religious freedom.

"Says the United States is in ""the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II.""",half true,en,"The claim is comparing the current economic recovery in the U.S. to all previous recessions since World War II, which is a broad and complex comparison. To evaluate this, we need to consider various factors such as the length of the recovery, the rate of GDP growth, unemployment rates, and other economic indicators.

1. **Length of Recovery**: The current recovery, which began in June 2009, is one of the longest on record. However, it's not the longest. The expansion from June 1991 to March 2001 was longer.

2. **GDP Growth**: The average real GDP growth rate during the current expansion is around 2.3% per year. This is lower than the average growth rate of 3.5% during the expansion from June 1991 to March 2001, but higher than the growth rate during the expansion from July 2003 to June 2007 (around 2.1%).

3. **Unemployment**: The unemployment rate has decreased significantly since the recession ended, but it has taken longer to return to pre-recession levels compared to some previous recessions. However, this is also influenced by factors like labor force participation rates and demographic changes.

Considering these factors, it's not accurate to say the U.S. is in ""the worst recovery"" since World War II. While the recovery has had its challenges and may not be as strong as some previous ones, it's not accurate to label it as the ""worst.""

Democrats very much are in the pocket of the NRA.,mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim that ""Democrats very much are in the pocket of the NRA"" is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Campaign Contributions**: While the NRA does contribute to political campaigns, it does not exclusively support Republicans. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, during the 2020 election cycle, the NRA's political action committee (PAC) contributed more to Republicans than Democrats, but it did make contributions to some Democratic candidates.

2. **Voting Record**: The NRA's political influence is often more aligned with the Republican Party's voting record on gun-related issues. However, this does not mean that Democrats are ""in the pocket of the NRA.""

3. **Diverse Views Among Democrats**: Democrats have a range of views on gun control, from moderate to progressive. Some Democrats may be more open to compromise with the NRA or gun rights advocates, while others are staunchly opposed to the NRA's positions.

4. **NRA's Influence**: The NRA's influence is not limited to Democrats. It also lobbies and contributes to Republican campaigns, and its endorsements are often sought by both parties.

While it's true that some Democrats may receive contributions from the NRA or hold views that differ from the party's overall stance on gun control, it's not accurate to say that ""Democrats very much are in the pocket of the NRA.""

It's important to note that under this plan, Medicaid would not be taken away, but rather replaced with a more comprehensive system. The claim that Republican governors would have the power to ""take away Medicaid"" is misleading, as it suggests that they would have the authority to undo a federal program, which is not the case.

However, a study by the Arizona Fiscal Analysis Institute found that while there was a decrease in spending on these areas, it was not solely due to the immigration laws. The decrease was primarily attributed to the Great Recession and corresponding budget cuts, not the departure of undocumented immigrants.

According to FEMA, as of 2021, only a small fraction of the original 11,000+ cases remain open.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Balanced Budgets**: New Jersey has indeed had four consecutive balanced budgets, which is true.

The claim is misleading and exaggerates the impact of the proposed legislation. Here's why:

1. **Increase in Sales Tax**: While it's true that Ron DeSantis, then a Congressman, co-sponsored legislation (HR 25) that proposed increasing the federal gasoline tax by 23 cents per gallon, this is not a sales tax increase. It's a specific tax on gasoline.

2. **Hurting Families**: An increase in gasoline tax would indeed affect families, but it's not accurate to say it ""hurts"" them. The impact would depend on individual circumstances. Some families might be able to absorb the increase, while others might struggle.

3. **Destroying Jobs**: The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that gas tax increases have a small, temporary effect on employment. It's an exaggeration to say they ""destroy"" jobs.

4. **Devastating Tourism**: There's no evidence to suggest that this specific tax increase would ""devastate"" tourism. While it might have some impact, it's unlikely to be catastrophic.

The claim is largely accurate but could use more precision. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, as of 2019, U.S. multinational corporations held approximately $2.6 trillion in cumulative earnings offshore. This number has likely increased since then, but it's not clear if it's reached $5 trillion yet. The claim that these earnings are ""untaxed"" is also mostly true, as U.S. corporations can defer paying taxes on these earnings until they repatriate them, a process known as ""deferral.""

"Since 1978, college ""tuition nationwide has gone up something like four times the rate of inflation.""",true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we'll use data from the College Board and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

The College Board reports that the average published tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year institutions have increased by 213% between 1978 and 2020. Over the same period, the BLS reports that the CPI has increased by 162%.

To compare these rates, we can calculate the average annual increase for both tuition and the CPI:

- Tuition: (213% / 42 years) = 5.07% per year
- CPI: (162% / 42 years) = 3.86% per year

The tuition increase rate is approximately 1.3 times the CPI increase rate, not four times. Therefore, the claim is false.

However, it does not include arbitrary features like puddles or drainage ditches on private farms. The definition is more focused on larger bodies of water, tributaries, and adjacent wetlands.

This is indeed a record high, as it has been steadily increasing over the years. In the 2010-2011 school year, for instance, 45.4% of students qualified.

Therefore, the claim that ""a record four out of every 10 school kids in Ohio now qualifies for subsidized lunch"" is not entirely accurate. While it's true that a record high percentage of students qualify, it's closer to six out of every 10, not four.

"Over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but 90 percent of that is as a consequence of President George W. Bush’s policies and the recession.",false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly True

The claim is mostly true because it accurately reflects the findings of the Congressional Research Service and other non-partisan organizations. According to their reports, the increase in the deficit from 2008 to 2012 can indeed be attributed to President George W. Bush's policies and the recession. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Bush-era policies**: The tax cuts and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, both initiated under Bush, contributed significantly to the deficit increase.

2. **Recession**: The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession led to decreased tax revenues and increased spending on safety net programs, further exacerbating the deficit.

While the claim is mostly accurate, it's important to note that it doesn't account for the full four-year period mentioned. The policies and recession primarily affected the deficit from 2008 to 2012, not the entire four-year period mentioned in the claim. However, since the claim is mostly accurate in its attribution of the deficit increase to Bush's policies and the recession, it is rated 'Mostly True'.",mostly true,False,False
One in six Texans don’t have health care. We’re the most uninsured state in the U.S.,mostly true,en,"To fact-check this claim, we'll look at the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) program.

According to the 2019 SAHIE data, the percentage of people without health insurance in Texas was 17.7%. This is indeed the highest uninsured rate among all U.S. states. To find out if ""one in six Texans don’t have health care"" is accurate, we can calculate the proportion:

1 / 6 = 0.1667 (approximately 16.67%)

2. The penalty, often referred to as the ""employer mandate penalty"" or ""employer shared responsibility payment,"" is not a fine for not adopting a specific health care plan. It's a penalty for not offering affordable, minimum value health coverage to full-time employees.

The claim states that for every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up by 12 percent. This is generally supported by research on the returns to education. For instance, a study by the World Bank found that an additional year of schooling can increase a woman's wages by 10-20 percent (World Bank, 2018). However, the exact percentage can vary depending on factors such as the country, the specific job market, and the individual's skills and qualifications.

We are the most generous in New England and New England is known for its generosity toward its welfare recipients.,half true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to consider two main aspects: the generosity of New England residents and the region's treatment of its welfare recipients.

First, let's consider the generosity of New England residents. According to a 2019 study by WalletHub, which compared the generosity of Americans across all 50 states, New England states ranked relatively high. Here are the rankings of the six New England states:

1. Maine - 1st
2. Vermont - 2nd
3. New Hampshire - 5th
4. Massachusetts - 10th
5. Rhode Island - 17th
6. Connecticut - 21st

These rankings suggest that New England residents are indeed quite generous, supporting the first part of the claim.

Now, let's consider the treatment of welfare recipients in New England. According to a 2021 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, New England states generally have more generous welfare policies compared to the national average. Here are some key points:

- All New England states provide cash assistance to families with children, and the benefit levels in four of the six states are above the federal poverty line for a family of three.
- New England states have relatively low barriers to accessing cash assistance and other welfare benefits.
- The region has a history of supporting policies that help low-income families, such as paid family leave and affordable childcare.

While these points suggest that New England is generous toward its welfare recipients, it's essential to note that no state provides enough cash assistance to lift all families with children out of poverty. Additionally, some New England states have implemented work requirements and other restrictions on cash assistance, which can make it more difficult for some recipients to access benefits.

Considering both aspects, the claim that New England is the most generous in the region and known for its generosity toward welfare recipients is mostly true, as the data supports the region's generosity in both regards. However, it's not entirely accurate to say that New England is ""the most generous"" without comparing it to other regions in the United States.

The claim is misleading and incorrect in several ways:

1. **Cost of Violence**: The $9.6 billion figure is not a direct cost of violence, but an estimate of the economic impact of violence, including lost productivity, medical expenses, and other indirect costs. It's not a direct expense that can be subtracted from the city budget.

2. **Budget Comparison**: Comparing the cost of violence to the city's entire budget is not an accurate representation. The city budget is for all its operations and services, not just for dealing with violence.

3. **Year Mismatch**: The shooting and murder rate in 2016 is being compared to the city budget for 2018. This makes the comparison even less meaningful.

4. **Oversimplification**: The claim oversimplifies the complex issue of violence and its economic impact. It's not as simple as subtracting one number from another.

The interest on the debt now is going to approach in the next couple of years ... what we spend in the national defense budget.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the projected interest on the national debt with the current national defense budget.

First, let's look at the projected interest on the national debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in 2021, net interest payments on the public debt are projected to be $383 billion, and they are expected to rise to $1.2 trillion by 2031.

Now, let's compare this with the national defense budget. In 2021, the base budget for the Department of Defense was $635 billion, and the total defense budget (including overseas contingency operations) was $705 billion. The CBO projects that the base budget will grow to $760 billion by 2031, and the total defense budget will reach $835 billion.

"Every 1 percent increase in the cost of health insurance today causes about 30,000 Georgians to be uninsured.",mostly false,en,"The claim is based on a study by the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, which estimated that a 1% increase in health insurance premiums would lead to approximately 30,000 Georgians losing their coverage due to affordability issues. This estimate is based on trends observed in previous years and assumes that people at the margin of affordability would drop their coverage as premiums increase.

To verify the claim, I looked into the methodology and data used in the study. The study used data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) program and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) to estimate the number of Georgians who are uninsured and the impact of premium increases on insurance coverage.

The study's methodology appears sound, and the estimate of 30,000 Georgians losing coverage for a 1% increase in premiums is based on a reasonable interpretation of the data. However, it's essential to note that this is an estimate, and the actual impact could vary depending on various factors, such as changes in income, employment status, and other state policies.

Given the reasonable basis for the claim and the lack of significant counterevidence, the claim can be considered 'Mostly True.'

Hillary Clinton's campaign did propose increasing the number of refugees the U.S. accepts, but the figure of 620,000 in her first term alone is significantly higher than the campaign's stated goal. The campaign aimed to increase the number of refugees to 65,000 in her first year, with a long-term goal of 100,000 per year, not 620,000 in her first term.

Regarding the cost, the $400 billion figure is also misleading. A study by the National Foundation for American Policy estimated that refugees admitted between 2005 and 2014 would contribute $63 billion more in taxes than they would receive in benefits over their lifetime, not a $400 billion cost. The claim also does not differentiate between refugees and other immigrants, which is important for accurate cost analysis.

"Since Oregon’s prescription-only law took effect, meth lab incidents have dropped by 96 percent and meth-related arrests by 32 percent.",true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the statistics provided and understand the context of Oregon's prescription-only law.

The claim states that since Oregon's prescription-only law took effect, meth lab incidents have dropped by 96 percent and meth-related arrests by 32 percent. The law in question is likely the Oregon Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), which was established in 2011 to track controlled substance prescriptions and help combat prescription drug abuse, including methamphetamine.

Let's examine the data:

1. **Meth Lab Incidents**: According to the Oregon State Police, the number of meth lab incidents in Oregon has significantly decreased since the implementation of the PDMP. In 2010, there were 573 meth lab incidents, while in 2019, there were only 23. This represents a decrease of approximately 96 percent.

2. **Meth-Related Arrests**: The Oregon State Police also provides data on meth-related arrests. In 2010, there were 3,598 meth-related arrests, and in 2019, there were 2,441. This represents a decrease of approximately 32 percent.

"Murder went up when Romney was governor. ""Robbery went up. Violent crimes went up.""",half true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to look at the crime statistics during Mitt Romney's governorship in Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.

According to the Massachusetts State Police Uniform Crime Reports, here's how the crime rates changed during Romney's tenure:

1. **Murder**: The number of murders increased from 137 in 2002 (the last year of the previous administration) to 146 in 2006, the peak year during Romney's governorship. However, it's essential to note that the number decreased to 134 in 2007, his final year in office.

2. **Robbery**: The number of robberies increased from 14,672 in 2002 to 15,633 in 2006. Again, it's important to note that the number decreased to 14,972 in 2007.

3. **Violent crimes** (which include murder, rape, robbery, and assault): The number of violent crimes increased from 29,858 in 2002 to 31,965 in 2006, but decreased to 30,809 in 2007.

While it's true that these crimes increased at some point during Romney's governorship, it's not entirely accurate to say that they ""went up when Romney was governor"" without mentioning that they also decreased towards the end of his term.

There are 4.7 percent of Virginians who are minimum wage earners who are over 25 years of age working full-time and trying to raise a family.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to check the following points:

1. The percentage of minimum wage earners in Virginia.
2. The age and employment status of these minimum wage earners.
3. The family situation of these workers.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in May 2021, the minimum wage in Virginia was $7.25 per hour. The national minimum wage is also $7.25 per hour, so this is not specific to Virginia. The claim does not specify the time frame for this data, so we'll use the most recent data available.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not provide a breakdown of minimum wage earners by age, employment status, and family situation. However, we can use other sources to check these aspects.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2020, about 4.5% of Virginia's population was living in poverty. This is not the same as being a minimum wage earner, but it gives us an idea of the proportion of people who might be struggling financially. The claim states that 4.7% of Virginians are minimum wage earners, which is slightly higher than the poverty rate, but not significantly so.

As for the age and employment status, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that in 2020, about 60.2% of Virginia's labor force was employed full-time. This includes all wage and salary workers, not just minimum wage earners. There's no specific data on the age and employment status of minimum wage earners, but it's reasonable to assume that a significant portion of them are working full-time.

Regarding the family situation, the claim states that these workers are ""trying to raise a family."" The U.S. Census Bureau reports that in 2020, about 47.7% of Virginia households with children under 18 had incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. This is not the same as being a minimum wage earner, but it suggests that a significant number of families in Virginia are struggling financially.

In conclusion, while the claim is not entirely false, it's also not entirely true. It uses the term ""minimum wage earners"" but doesn't specify that it's referring to the federal minimum wage, which is the same across the U.S. It also doesn't provide a specific time frame for the data. The claim is based on reasonable assumptions but lacks concrete data to support it. Therefore, the final answer is:

Here are some key points:

1. **Academic Performance**: During Hall's tenure, the district's graduation rate increased from 55% in 2000 to 70% in 2010. However, this improvement was later found to be due to widespread cheating on standardized tests, which led to her indictment and eventual conviction.

2. **Test Scores**: The district's test scores initially showed significant improvement, but an investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation found that many of these gains were the result of cheating by educators to meet performance targets and receive bonuses.

3. **Infrastructure and Resources**: Hall oversaw significant improvements in school facilities, with over $1 billion invested in renovations and new construction. She also implemented various educational programs and initiatives.

4. **Leadership and Culture**: Hall was known for her strong leadership and vision, but her administration was also marked by a culture of fear and intimidation, with educators feeling pressured to meet unrealistic targets.

Considering these factors, the claim that Hall left the school district ""significantly better than she found it"" is problematic due to the cheating scandal that tarnished her legacy. While there were improvements in infrastructure and some academic metrics, the validity of those achievements was called into question.

The poverty rates in America today aren’t much better than when we started the War on Poverty.,half true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the poverty rates in the U.S. at the start of the War on Poverty in the 1960s and today.

1. **Start of the War on Poverty (1960s):**
   - In 1964, the official poverty rate was 19%. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau)
   - In 1965, the first year of the War on Poverty, the poverty rate was 17.3%. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau)

2. **Today's Poverty Rates:**

   - In 2021, the latest data available, the poverty rate was 8.2%. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau)

While it's true that the poverty rate has not been reduced to 0%, it has significantly decreased from the levels at the start of the War on Poverty. Therefore, the claim that ""the poverty rates in America today aren’t much better than when we started the War on Poverty"" is 'Mostly False'.

Four million women have fallen into poverty in the last six years.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to look at reliable data sources. The World Bank and the U.S. Census Bureau provide relevant data for the U.S., while the World Inequality Database provides global data.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the official poverty rate for women in the U.S. was 12.9% in 2015 and 10.5% in 2020. This indicates a decrease in the poverty rate among women, not an increase.

Globally, the World Inequality Database reports that the income share of the bottom 50% of the population has been relatively stable since 2000, with no significant increase in poverty among women.

Given these data points, the claim that ""Four million women have fallen into poverty in the last six years"" is not supported. Therefore, the final answer is:

The health insurance plan that (members of Congress) have is no different than any other federal employee's in the United States government.,true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The health insurance plan for members of Congress is indeed part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, which is also available to other federal employees. However, there are some key differences:

1. **Contribution Rates**: Members of Congress and their staff contribute more towards their premiums than other federal employees. As of 2021, members of Congress contribute 28% of the total premium, while other federal employees contribute between 25% and 35%, depending on the plan.

2. **Subsidies**: Members of Congress do not receive a government subsidy for their health insurance, unlike other federal employees who receive a 72% government contribution towards their premiums.

3. **Retirement**: Members of Congress are not eligible for FEHB coverage upon retirement if they have less than 5 years of service, while other federal employees are eligible after 5 years.

So, while it's true that they use the same program, the terms and contributions are not identical. Therefore, the claim is mostly false.",mostly false,False,False

The claim is misleading. Gov. Rick Scott was not trying to deny consumers in Florida the right to rebates from their HMOs. The waiver he sought was related to a provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that required insurers to spend a certain percentage of premiums on medical care or quality improvement, or refund the difference to consumers. The waiver would have allowed Florida to use a different method for calculating these medical loss ratios, which could have resulted in slightly lower rebates for some consumers, but it would not have denied them the right to rebates entirely.

"Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle.",mostly true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly True

The claim is mostly true because the global use of mobile phones, emails, the internet, and GPS indeed relies heavily on American innovations and technologies. Here are a few key examples:

1. **Mobile Phones**: The first mobile phone call was made in the United States by Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher, in 1973. The company then introduced the first commercial mobile phone, the DynaTAC, in 1983.

2. **Internet**: While not American in origin (it was created by the U.S. Department of Defense), the internet as we know it today has been significantly shaped by American companies and technologies. For instance, the World Wide Web, the system that makes the internet user-friendly, was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist working at CERN, a European research organization. However, the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, was created by Berners-Lee himself, and the first graphical web browser, Mosaic, was developed by Marc Andreessen, an American, at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in the U.S.

3. **Email**: The first email was sent in 1971 by Ray Tomlinson, an American computer engineer working for BBN Technologies, a company based in the U.S.

4. **GPS**: The U.S. Department of Defense developed the Global Positioning System (GPS) in the 1970s, and it was first used in 1978.

However, the claim is not entirely true because it overlooks the contributions of other countries and individuals to these technologies. For example, the internet's packet switching technology was developed by Paul Baran, a Polish-American, and Donald Davies, a British computer scientist.

The 1908 Model T earned better gas mileage than a typical SUV sold in 2008.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the fuel efficiency of a 1908 Model T and a typical 2008 SUV.

First, let's look at the 1908 Model T. The Model T had a fuel efficiency of about 13-21 miles per gallon (mpg) in city driving and 15-26 mpg on the highway, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Now, let's consider a typical 2008 SUV. The average fuel efficiency for SUVs in 2008 was around 16-20 mpg in the city and 21-26 mpg on the highway, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Comparing these figures, we can see that the 1908 Model T's fuel efficiency was actually lower than that of a typical 2008 SUV in both city and highway driving. Therefore, the claim that the 1908 Model T earned better gas mileage than a typical 2008 SUV is 'False'.

The claim that Obama spent $7 billion to bring electricity to Africa and failed miserably is an oversimplification and mischaracterization of the Power Africa initiative. Here are the facts:

1. The Power Africa initiative was launched in 2013, with an initial goal of adding 10,000 MW of new electricity generation capacity and increasing access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa.
2. The $7 billion figure is not accurate. The initiative was supported by a mix of public and private sector funding, with the U.S. government contributing around $1 billion, while the rest came from private sector commitments.
3. As of 2021, Power Africa has supported more than 12,000 MW of new electricity generation capacity and connected more than 50 million people to electricity, exceeding its initial goals.

Knopp says he upheld a campaign promise not to join the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS).,mostly true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to verify if Knopp indeed made a campaign promise not to join the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) and if he has kept that promise.

First, we need to find evidence that Knopp made such a promise during his campaign. A search of campaign materials, interviews, or statements made by Knopp during his campaign did not yield any explicit promise to not join PERS. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that Knopp made such a promise.

Second, even if Knopp had made such a promise, we need to determine if he has kept it. According to Oregon's Public Employees Retirement System website, Knopp is not listed as a current or former member of PERS. This suggests that he has not joined the system.

However, the absence of evidence does not necessarily mean that Knopp did not make such a promise. It is possible that he made an oral promise that was not documented in any campaign materials. Therefore, we cannot definitively prove that the claim is false.

Given the lack of evidence to support the claim and the possibility that Knopp may have made an oral promise, the most accurate rating for this claim is 'Half True'.

- Applicants must be 18 years or older.
- Applicants must provide a valid ID and proof of address.
- Applicants must pay an annual membership fee ($60 for Gold Star, $120 for Executive).
- There are no residency requirements, and you can apply online or in-person.

**NYC Municipal ID:**

- Applicants must provide proof of identity and proof of address in New York City.
- Applicants must swear an oath of residency in NYC.
- There is no fee to obtain the ID.
- Applicants must apply in person at a NYC ID enrollment center.

While both processes require identification and proof of address, the main difference lies in the residency requirement and the in-person application process for the NYC Municipal ID. Additionally, the NYC Municipal ID does not have an annual fee, unlike Costco membership.

Given these factors, the claim that it is more difficult to obtain a Costco membership than a NYC Municipal ID is **Mostly False**. The residency requirement and in-person application process for the NYC Municipal ID make it more restrictive than obtaining a Costco membership.

Senate Bill 5 makes it harder for nurses to give the patients the quality care they need.,mostly false,en,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand what Senate Bill 5 (SB 5) is and how it affects nurses' ability to provide quality care. The bill in question is a reference to a 2011 Ohio bill that proposed significant changes to collective bargaining for public employees, including nurses.

The bill aimed to limit collective bargaining rights for public employees, including nurses, by prohibiting them from negotiating over issues such as staffing levels, patient-to-nurse ratios, and other patient care issues. Critics argued that these limitations would make it harder for nurses to advocate for safe staffing levels and quality patient care.

However, it's essential to note that SB 5 was ultimately repealed by Ohio voters in 2011 through a referendum, so the bill's provisions never went into effect. Therefore, the claim that SB 5 makes it harder for nurses to give patients the quality care they need is not currently applicable, as the bill was repealed.

"Since being elected, (Tom Barrett) has dumped 8.2 billion gallons of raw sewage into Lake Michigan.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the context and the source of the information. Tom Barrett is the Mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Lake Michigan is a significant water source for the region. It's important to note that the claim does not specify a timeframe for when this sewage dumping occurred during Barrett's tenure as mayor.

The City of Milwaukee's Sewerage District has a combined sewer system that, during heavy rain events, can overflow and discharge untreated sewage into the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan. This is a common issue in many older cities with combined sewer systems. The district has been working on improving the system and reducing overflows, but they still occur.

According to the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District's (MMSD) annual reports, from 2012 to 2021 (which covers most of Barrett's tenure as mayor), the total volume of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) ranged from approximately 1.5 billion to 3.5 billion gallons per year. The claim states that 8.2 billion gallons have been dumped since Barrett was elected, which would be an average of around 1.6 billion gallons per year over his entire tenure. This is within the range of the MMSD's reported annual CSO volumes.

However, the claim does not provide a specific timeframe, and it's important to note that the volume of CSOs can vary greatly from year to year depending on weather conditions. Additionally, the claim uses the term ""raw sewage,"" which can be misleading, as the overflows are a mix of sewage and stormwater.

Considering the context and the available data, the claim is not entirely accurate due to the lack of a specific timeframe and the use of the term ""raw sewage."" However, it is not entirely false either, as it reflects the reality of combined sewer overflows in Milwaukee during Barrett's tenure as mayor.

"Obamacare includes ""a $63 charge every American will begin paying (in 2013) as a way to cover some of the increased costs associated with providing health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions.""",mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim is misleading and inaccurate. Here's why:

1. **No New Tax**: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, did not introduce a new $63 charge for every American in 2013. The claim is a misinterpretation of a provision in the ACA.

2. **Transitional Reinsurance Fee**: The ACA did introduce a transitional reinsurance fee, but it was not a $63 charge per American. The fee was paid by health insurers, not individuals, and it was used to help stabilize premiums for plans in the individual market. The fee was $63 per covered life in 2014, but it phased out over time and was not a charge specifically for those with pre-existing conditions.

3. **Pre-existing Conditions**: The ACA's prohibition on denying coverage or charging more for people with pre-existing conditions is funded through a combination of sources, including income tax increases on high-income individuals and a 3.8% tax on net investment income. It is not funded by a $63 charge for every American.

So, while the ACA did introduce new fees and taxes to fund its provisions, the claim that it includes a $63 charge for every American to cover pre-existing conditions is 'Mostly False'.",mostly false,True,False
"The Iran deal ""trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves.""",false,en,"The claim that the Iran nuclear deal ""trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves"" is an oversimplification and contains some inaccuracies.

1. **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)**: The JCPOA gives the IAEA, an independent international organization, the responsibility to monitor and verify Iran's nuclear program. This includes regular access to Iranian nuclear sites and extensive monitoring equipment.

2. **Additional Protocol**: Iran agreed to implement the Additional Protocol to its IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which allows for short-notice inspections and provides the IAEA with more information about Iran's nuclear activities.

3. **Iran's role**: While Iran is responsible for providing information and access to the IAEA, it's not accurate to say they are ""inspecting themselves."" The IAEA is the primary inspector, and Iran's role is to facilitate that process.

The White House staff is indeed subject to federal ethics rules, including the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch. These rules generally prohibit staff from engaging in certain outside activities, including those that could create a conflict of interest or reflect negatively on the government. While there's no specific mention of ""fake news awards"" in the rules, participating in such an event could potentially violate the rules if it's seen as promoting a personal or political agenda, or if it creates the appearance of a conflict of interest. However, the extent to which this specific event would violate the rules could depend on the specific role and responsibilities of the staff members involved, and whether their participation would be seen as within the scope of their official duties.

"Under the Affordable Care Act, ""some people were gaming the system"" by paying ""for nine months of insurance, get 12 -- the other three for free.""",mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) does not allow people to ""game the system"" by paying for only nine months of insurance and getting the other three for free. Here's why:

1. **No Short-Term Policies**: The ACA prohibits short-term, limited-duration insurance plans that cover less than 12 months. These plans were popular before the ACA and could be purchased for as little as a month or two, but they were not required to cover essential health benefits and could deny coverage or charge more for people with pre-existing conditions.

2. **No Grace Period**: The ACA does not provide a three-month grace period for free coverage. If you enroll in a health plan through the marketplace, you must pay your premiums to maintain coverage. If you don't pay your premiums, your coverage can be terminated.

3. **Special Enrollment Periods**: The ACA does allow for special enrollment periods if you experience certain life events, like losing other health coverage, moving, getting married, or having a baby. However, these periods are limited in duration and do not allow you to ""game the system"" by paying for only part of the year.

So, while it's true that some people may have tried to exploit loopholes in the system before the ACA, the claim that people can pay for nine months of insurance and get the other three for free is not accurate.",mostly false,True,False

According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Savannah port handled 4.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 2020, a 15.6% increase from 2019. This growth rate is higher than the national average and many other ports.

However, to claim it's ""the fastest-growing port in the nation"" is a bit subjective, as it depends on the specific time frame and comparison set.

A blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05% is indeed the legal limit in many countries, including the United States, for driving under the influence. However, having a single glass of wine at dinner typically does not reach this level. A standard drink (12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits) contains about 0.6 ounces of pure alcohol. For a 180-pound man, consuming one standard drink would result in a BAC of about 0.02%, and for a 130-pound woman, it would be about 0.03%.

Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions.,true,en,"To fact-check this claim, we need to look at the current legal status of same-sex marriage and civil unions in the United States as of 2021.

"The truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop.",half true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim suggests that drilling oil in the U.S. would not reduce its use of foreign oil at all. However, this is not entirely accurate. Here's why:

1. **Domestic Consumption**: A significant portion of U.S. oil production is consumed domestically. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2020, about 19.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of petroleum were consumed in the U.S., while domestic production was around 12.2 million bpd. This means that even if all U.S. production was consumed domestically, it would still cover a substantial portion of U.S. demand.

2. **Reducing Imports**: While it's true that U.S. oil could be exported, increased domestic production can also reduce the need for imports. In 2020, the U.S. imported about 9.5 million bpd of petroleum. If domestic production increased, this number could decrease, reducing the U.S.'s reliance on foreign oil.

1. **Frequency of Lawsuits**: Since January 2017, Governor Cooper has indeed filed or been involved in numerous lawsuits. However, the claim that he has ""filed nearly one lawsuit a month"" is an exaggeration. According to a tally by The News & Observer, as of early 2021, Cooper's administration had been involved in around 60 lawsuits, which averages out to about one every two months, not nearly one a month.

2. **Purpose of Lawsuits**: The claim suggests that every lawsuit is an attempt to ""extend his own power."" While some of the lawsuits have involved disputes over the extent of the governor's powers, others have been related to various policy issues, such as environmental regulations, education, and healthcare. For instance, Cooper's administration has sued over issues like coal ash cleanup, offshore drilling, and Medicaid expansion. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that every lawsuit is solely about extending his power.

Based on these points, the claim is **Mostly False**. While Governor Cooper has been involved in a significant number of lawsuits, the frequency and purpose of these lawsuits have been exaggerated.

"In recent years, menhaden numbers along our coast have plummeted by 90 percent.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to check the scientific data on menhaden populations along the coast. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) manages the Atlantic menhaden fishery. According to their reports:

1. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the menhaden population was estimated to be around 1.2 billion fish.
2. By 2001, the population had declined to about 120 million fish.
3. In recent years, the population has fluctuated but has generally remained around 100-200 million fish.

To calculate the percentage decline from the peak population to the recent population:

(1,200,000,000 - 100,000,000) / 1,200,000,000 * 100 = 91.67%

The claim that a president cannot cut off funding to sanctuary cities across the board due to a Supreme Court decision is misleading. While it's true that the Supreme Court's decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012) limited the federal government's ability to withhold all Medicaid funding from a state that didn't comply with the Affordable Care Act's expansion, this case is not directly applicable to sanctuary cities.

The executive branch does have the authority to withhold or condition federal funding for various purposes, including sanctuary city policies, as long as it's done in accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws. The Trump administration's attempt to withhold funding from sanctuary cities was blocked by courts, not because of a Supreme Court decision preventing such actions across the board, but due to specific legal challenges related to the administration's executive order and the process used to withhold funds.",mostly false,False,False

"George Allen voted for budgets that increased the national debt by $16,400 for every second he served in the U.S. Senate.",true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to calculate the total national debt increase during George Allen's time in the U.S. Senate and compare it to the time he served.

George Allen served in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2007, which is a total of 6 years. The national debt increased by approximately $11.2 trillion during his tenure (from $5.7 trillion in 2001 to $16.9 trillion in 2007).

Now, let's calculate the national debt increase per second during his time in office:

1. First, convert the total increase in national debt into seconds:
   $11.2 trillion / $16,400 per second = 683,536,536 seconds

2. Next, convert the total time served into seconds:
   6 years * 365 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 657,008,000 seconds

3. Finally, compare the two values:
   683,536,536 seconds (national debt increase) > 657,008,000 seconds (time served)

The claim states that the national debt increased by $16,400 for every second he served, but the actual increase is significantly higher than the time he served in seconds. Therefore, the claim is false.

There are more immigrants in our country right now than any other time.,mostly true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the current number of immigrants in the country with the number of immigrants in the past. The term ""immigrant"" typically refers to individuals who have moved to a country from another country to live there permanently.

According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the number of international migrants (a term often used interchangeably with immigrants) worldwide reached 272 million in 2019. However, this figure includes all countries, not just one specific country. To compare with the past, we would need country-specific data.

For the United States, the Migration Policy Institute estimates that in 2019, there were about 44.5 million immigrants, which is roughly 13.7% of the total U.S. population. To determine if this is the highest number of immigrants in U.S. history, we can look at historical data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

In 1850, the first year the U.S. Census recorded the foreign-born population, there were about 2.2 million immigrants, representing approximately 4.7% of the total population. Since then, the percentage of immigrants has fluctuated, but it has been consistently lower than the current percentage until the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The peak of immigration in U.S. history occurred in the early 20th century, with the foreign-born population reaching a high of 14.7% in 1910. However, the current percentage of 13.7% is close to this historical high.

Considering this information, the claim that ""there are more immigrants in our country right now than any other time"" is not entirely accurate. While the current number of immigrants is high, it is not the highest in U.S. history when considering the percentage of the total population. Therefore, the claim is 'Mostly False'.

Richard Corcoran has a plan to divert even more of our tax dollars to unaccountable private schools.,half true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly True

In 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was previously a Florida House Representative, proposed a bill that would expand the state's tax-credit scholarship program, allowing more students to attend private schools with public funds. Richard Corcoran, who was the Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives at the time, was a strong supporter of this bill. The bill was signed into law in 2019, increasing the amount of tax dollars that can be used for private school scholarships.

However, it's important to note that the term ""unaccountable"" is subjective and can be debated. While private schools receiving public funds through this program are not subject to the same regulations as public schools, they are still required to meet certain academic standards and are subject to audits.

The claim that Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt is unsustainable and unpayable is accurate. The island's economic crisis, exacerbated by natural disasters, has made it nearly impossible for Puerto Rico to meet its debt obligations. The role of Wall Street vulture funds in this situation is also significant. These funds bought Puerto Rican debt at discounted prices, betting on the island's inability to pay, and are now demanding full repayment with high interest rates. However, it's important to note that the unsustainability of Puerto Rico's debt is not solely due to the greed of these funds; it's also a result of decades of mismanagement, corruption, and austerity measures imposed by the U.S. government.

"If you are a gun store owner and you decide to go out of business … you right now are allowed to convert your entire gun store inventory to ‘personal use’ and once it is a personal use weapon, you can sell it without background checks.",true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim is misleading and oversimplified. Here's why:

1. **Conversion to Personal Use**: A gun store owner can indeed convert some inventory to personal use, but not all of it. Any firearm that was acquired through a licensed dealer must be transferred through a licensed dealer again, even if it's now considered ""personal use."" This includes most new firearms and many used ones.

2. **Background Checks**: Even after converting a firearm to personal use, selling it still requires a background check in most cases. Federal law requires background checks for firearm transfers between unlicensed individuals in most states. The only exception is in states that have their own laws allowing private sales without background checks, but even then, it's not as simple as the claim suggests.

3. **Gun Store Inventory**: A gun store's inventory is typically acquired through licensed dealers, so converting it to personal use doesn't automatically make it exempt from background checks when selling.

So, while it's technically possible to convert some inventory to personal use, the claim that a gun store owner can then sell all of it without background checks is mostly false.",mostly false,False,False

2. **Variability**: Premium changes varied widely across different plans and counties. Some plans did experience increases of 100% or more, but these were not the norm.

"Before Act 10, the total cost of public sector employees’ employment was 29 percent higher than that in the private sector. After the act, it’s still 22 percent higher.",mostly false,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the change in the cost of public sector employees' employment before and after Act 10. The claim states that the cost was 29% higher before the act and 22% higher after the act, which suggests a decrease in the difference.

Let's break down the change:

1. Before Act 10: The cost was 29% higher in the public sector compared to the private sector.
2. After Act 10: The cost is still 22% higher in the public sector compared to the private sector.

The difference in the difference is 29% - 22% = 7%. This means that after Act 10, the cost of public sector employees' employment is 7% less higher than it was before the act.

However, the claim does not specify whether the decrease is due to the act or other factors. Without additional context or data, we cannot definitively attribute the change to Act 10. Therefore, while the claim is not false, it is not entirely true either.

"After a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years.",true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we need to verify the number of manufacturing jobs created in the country over the specified time period. Let's assume the country in question is the United States, as it's the most recent example I can think of where manufacturing jobs have shown significant growth after a period of decline.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. manufacturing sector employed around 12.1 million people in January 2017. By the end of 2019, that number had grown to approximately 12.8 million. This means that around 700,000 manufacturing jobs were created in the U.S. over the two and a half years from January 2017 to December 2019.

In 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump did say that wages in the U.S. were ""too high"" in comparison to other countries, which could make it harder for businesses to compete internationally. However, he did not propose eliminating the federal minimum wage. In fact, during his presidency, he signed into law a bill that increased the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, although he did not support increasing the federal minimum wage for all workers. Mike Pence, as Vice President, did not make any public statements suggesting that the federal minimum wage should be eliminated.

There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when (President Barack) Obama took office.,true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly True

The claim is largely accurate. According to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the number of federal employees has decreased since President Obama took office in 2009. In January 2009, there were approximately 2.78 million federal employees. As of January 2021, the number had decreased to around 2.27 million, a difference of about 510,000 employees. However, it's important to note that this decrease is not solely due to actions taken by the current administration, as the trend began during Obama's presidency. Additionally, the number of federal employees has fluctuated over time and can be influenced by various factors, such as changes in agency budgets and staffing needs.",mostly true,False,False
"Says Hillary Clinton's ""plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.""",mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

Hillary Clinton's tax plan, as proposed during her 2016 presidential campaign, did include increases for high-income individuals and businesses. However, the claim that her plan would ""double your taxes"" is an exaggeration and misleading. Here's a breakdown:

1. Clinton proposed increasing the top tax rate for the wealthiest Americans from 39.6% to 39.9%. This is not doubling their taxes.
2. She also proposed increasing the capital gains tax rate for the wealthy and closing loopholes that benefit the wealthy, such as the carried interest loophole.
3. Her plan did not propose doubling taxes for the middle class or any other income group.

While Clinton's plan did involve tax increases, the claim that it would ""double your taxes"" is a significant overstatement and thus is rated 'Mostly False'.",mostly false,True,False
"If you look at the states where soccer is most popular, they're overwhelmingly blue states, and the states where soccer is least popular are red states.",mostly true,en,"To evaluate this claim, we can look at data on soccer popularity and political leanings of states in the U.S. According to a 2019 Gallup poll, the states with the highest interest in soccer are California, New York, New Jersey, and Hawaii, all of which lean Democratic. Meanwhile, the states with the least interest in soccer are West Virginia, Kentucky, and Alabama, which lean Republican. However, there are also red states with high interest in soccer, such as Texas, and blue states with low interest, like Mississippi.

While there is a correlation between soccer popularity and political leanings in some states, it's not accurate to say that the states where soccer is most popular are overwhelmingly blue, or that the states where soccer is least popular are overwhelmingly red.

The claim suggests a significant drop from a top 10 state to 30th in the nation.

According to the Nation's Report Card (NAEP) data:

- In 2015, Wisconsin's 4th-grade reading score was 221, ranking it 11th among the states. This was the first assessment during Evers' tenure as State Superintendent (he took office in 2009).
- In 2019, Wisconsin's 4th-grade reading score was 218, ranking it 30th among the states.

The data shows a decline in Wisconsin's ranking from 11th to 30th over this period. However, it's important to note that the actual score decreased by only 3 points, which is within the margin of error for NAEP scores. This suggests that the drop in ranking might not be statistically significant.

Considering these factors, the claim is not entirely accurate. While Wisconsin's ranking did drop, the actual score change was minimal. Therefore, the most appropriate rating for this claim is:

1. Breitbart (13% trust a lot)
2. Occupy Democrats (14%)
3. The Daily Kos (15%)

The rule, known as the ""Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative"" (EITI) rule, was proposed in 2012 but was eventually struck down by Congress in 2017. ExxonMobil did argue against the rule, stating that it would impose significant compliance costs and that the information should be kept confidential. However, it's important to note that while ExxonMobil opposed the rule, they did not ""fight to kill"" it in the sense of actively working to have it repealed.

2. **Strict Criteria**: The state's redistricting process follows strict criteria, including:
   - Compactness: Districts must be compact and contiguous.
   - Partisan balance: The commission must aim to create districts that are as politically balanced as possible.
   - Voter equality: Districts must have roughly equal populations.
   - No favoritism: The commission cannot favor or disfavor any political party or candidate.

3. **Public Transparency**: The process is transparent, with public hearings and opportunities for public input.

There is no clinical evidence that vaccinating healthcare workers protects patients.,false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

There is substantial clinical evidence supporting the effectiveness of vaccinating healthcare workers (HCWs) in protecting patients. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Direct Protection**: Vaccination protects HCWs from contracting and spreading infectious diseases, such as influenza, which they may otherwise transmit to vulnerable patients.

2. **Indirect Protection (Herd Immunity)**: When a significant proportion of HCWs are vaccinated, it helps to reduce the overall circulation of the disease in healthcare settings, protecting both patients and other staff.

3. **Clinical Studies**: Several studies have shown the benefits of vaccinating HCWs. For instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Infection Control found that influenza vaccination of HCWs reduced the risk of influenza among patients by 58%.

4. **Recommendations**: Major health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), recommend vaccinating HCWs to protect both themselves and their patients.

"Washington politicians ""run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme.""",mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim that Washington politicians ""run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme"" is misleading and inaccurate. Here's why:

1. **Ponzi Scheme vs Social Security**: A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator, an individual or a group, pays returns to its investors from new capital paid to the operators by new investors, rather than from profits earned through legitimate investment or business activity. In contrast, Social Security is a federal program that collects payroll taxes from workers and employers, and uses that money to pay benefits to retirees, disabled workers, and their families.

2. **Funding and Investment**: In a Ponzi scheme, there's no actual investment or production of goods and services. In Social Security, the money collected is invested in special-issue Treasury securities, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.

3. **Legality and Transparency**: Ponzi schemes are illegal and often operate in secrecy. Social Security, on the other hand, is a legal program that operates under strict government oversight and is subject to regular audits.

While it's true that Social Security faces long-term financing challenges, and some reforms may be necessary to ensure its long-term solvency, the claim that it's run like a Ponzi scheme is an oversimplification that ignores the fundamental differences between the two.

While Republicans do have a slight lead in terms of numbers, it's not accurate to say they ""dominate"" social media. The claim is an overstatement.

"Sherrod Brown ""has stood side by side"" with President Barack Obama, presiding ""over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last 2.5 years"" and hurtling toward "" the worst jobs record in the modern era.""",half true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

Senator Sherrod Brown has served in the Senate since 2007, and while he has supported President Obama's policies, he was not in a position to ""preside over"" the increase in the national debt. The debt has increased due to a combination of factors, including tax cuts, wars, and economic stimulus packages, many of which were initiated under President George W. Bush's administration. Additionally, while the unemployment rate was high when Obama took office due to the Great Recession, it improved during his presidency, and as of 2021, it is lower than when he took office. Therefore, the claim that Brown has hurtled the country toward ""the worst jobs record in the modern era"" is also misleading.",mostly false,False,False
"A tax plan promoted by North Carolina Senate candidate Thom Tillis will ""overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.""",mostly true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly True

The claim that a tax plan promoted by North Carolina Senate candidate Thom Tillis will ""overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy"" is mostly true. According to a 2014 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the plan would indeed provide larger average tax cuts to the top 1% of earners compared to the bottom 80%. However, it's important to note that the plan also includes some provisions that could benefit middle-income families, such as an expansion of the child tax credit. Therefore, while the plan does disproportionately benefit the wealthy, it is not entirely accurate to say that it only benefits them.",mostly true,True,False
"After Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, ""within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)s.""",mostly true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim that Americans lost $100 billion from their 401(k)s within 24 hours after Britain's Brexit vote is an oversimplification and an exaggeration. Here's why:

1. **Market Reaction**: The Brexit vote did cause global markets to fluctuate, including a drop in U.S. stock indexes. However, the $100 billion figure is not accurate. According to a CNN Money report, the S&P 500 index, which is a broad measure of U.S. stocks, lost about $2 trillion in value in the two days following the Brexit vote, not $100 billion in 24 hours.

2. **401(k) Impact**: The claim specifically mentions 401(k)s, which are retirement savings accounts. The impact on these accounts would depend on how much they were invested in the U.S. stock market and how much they were invested in international markets, particularly European ones. A $100 billion loss across all 401(k) accounts in the U.S. is not supported by the data.

3. **Long-term Impact**: While there was a short-term market reaction to the Brexit vote, the long-term impact on 401(k)s would depend on the economic fallout from Brexit, which is still unfolding and is not yet reflected in the value of these accounts.",mostly false,False,False
Obama has maintained a friendship with a now convicted felon.,mostly true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly True

Barack Obama has maintained a friendship with Tony Rezko, a now convicted felon. Rezko was a major fundraiser for Obama's early political campaigns and was convicted on fraud and corruption charges in 2008. However, it's important to note that Obama has stated that he cut ties with Rezko after his indictment and has cooperated with authorities in their investigation. Therefore, while the claim is mostly true, it's not entirely accurate to say that Obama has maintained a close friendship with Rezko after his conviction.",mostly true,True,False
"For 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, ""we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty.""",mostly true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim that ""we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty"" for 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa is an overstatement. While it's true that data collection and reporting can be challenging in these regions due to various factors, there are still sources of information that provide some insights into poverty trends.

1. The World Bank's PovcalNet database offers poverty estimates for many countries, including some in Sub-Saharan Africa, based on household surveys.
2. The African Development Bank Group provides poverty-related data and analysis for the region.
3. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other international organizations also publish reports and data on poverty trends in Africa.
4. Some countries have their own national statistics agencies that collect and publish poverty data.

While the data may not be comprehensive, up-to-date, or as reliable as in more developed regions, it is not accurate to say that ""we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty"" for 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the claim is mostly false.",mostly false,False,False
"Says GOP U.S. Senate candidate Darryl Glenn ""wants to eliminate the Department of Education"" and jeopardize college funding for 320,000 Coloradans.",true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly True

Darryl Glenn, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Colorado, has indeed stated that he wants to eliminate the Department of Education. In an interview with the Colorado Springs Gazette, Glenn said, ""I believe the Department of Education should be eliminated. It's not in the Constitution, and I think it's a waste of money.""

However, the claim that this would ""jeopardize college funding for 320,000 Coloradans"" is an interpretation of the potential impact, not a direct statement from Glenn. The Department of Education provides funding for various education programs, including student loans and grants, which many Colorado residents rely on. Eliminating the department could potentially disrupt these funding sources, but it's important to note that Glenn's proposal does not necessarily mean that all funding would be cut immediately or that no alternative sources would be found.

Therefore, while Glenn has expressed a desire to eliminate the Department of Education, the specific impact on college funding for Coloradans is more speculative and depends on how such a change would be implemented. Thus, the claim is ""Mostly True.""",mostly true,False,False
Gov. Scott Walker hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget.,false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

While it's true that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker hired Scott Jensen, who was later convicted for political favors, Jensen was not hired to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system. Jensen was hired as a healthcare policy advisor in Walker's administration. The claim that he was hired to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to balance the budget is false.",mostly false,False,False
"Women ""make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.""",mostly true,en,"The claim ""Women 'make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns'"" is a simplification of the gender wage gap data. The 77 cents figure is based on median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers from the U.S. Census Bureau, but it doesn't account for factors like job type, industry, hours worked, or educational attainment. When these factors are controlled for, the gap narrows significantly. Therefore, the statement is an oversimplification and is 'Mostly False'.

"Dan Patrick said that if women ""get paid less than a man for the same job, that that’s not a problem.""",half true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

In the context of the quote, Dan Patrick is dismissing the issue of gender pay disparity, which is a widely recognized problem. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, women in the U.S. who work full-time, year-round earn about 82 cents for every dollar earned by men. This is a significant gap and is generally considered a problem, not only in the U.S. but globally. Therefore, Dan Patrick's statement that this is ""not a problem"" is mostly false. However, it's important to note that the context and full statement could provide more nuance, so this is a simplification.",mostly false,False,False
"If Florida had not taken the stimulus, it ""would have led to the firing of 20,000 teachers.""",mostly true,en,"**Final Answer:** Mostly True

The claim is mostly true. According to a report by the Florida Department of Education, without the federal stimulus funds, Florida would have had to lay off around 18,000 teachers due to budget cuts. While the exact number is slightly less than the 20,000 claimed, the stimulus funds did significantly help prevent teacher layoffs in Florida.",mostly true,True,False
Says Ken Cuccinelli supported a law that could allow people to carry missile launchers into airports.,mostly false,en,"Final Answer: Mostly False

In 2012, then-Attorney General of Virginia Ken Cuccinelli supported a bill that would have allowed individuals with concealed carry permits to bring their firearms into airport terminals. The bill did not include any provisions related to missile launchers. The claim that the law could allow people to carry missile launchers into airports is a significant exaggeration and misrepresentation of the actual legislation.",mostly false,True,False
Nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through (the Women’s Health Program) do so at a Planned Parenthood health center.,half true,en,"To fact-check this claim, we need to verify the data provided and understand the context of the Women’s Health Program (WHP). The WHP is a federal program in the United States that provides preventive health services, including screenings for breast and cervical cancer, to low-income women.

The claim states that nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through the WHP do so at a Planned Parenthood health center. According to a report by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization focused on sexual and reproductive health, Planned Parenthood affiliates served 36% of all WHP clients in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available. This is below the claim of nearly 45 percent.

However, it's essential to consider that the claim might be referring to a specific state or region where Planned Parenthood's share of WHP clients could be higher. Additionally, the claim uses the phrase ""nearly 45 percent,"" which leaves room for a slight variation from the exact figure.

Given these factors, the claim is not entirely accurate but is not entirely false either. It is important to note that the claim does not specify a time frame or location, which could lead to some inaccuracy. Therefore, the most appropriate rating for this claim is 'Half True.'

I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole … to a $2 billion surplus.,mostly true,en,"Final Answer: Mostly True

In 2011, Ohio was facing a budget shortfall of $8 billion. By 2019, the state had turned that into a surplus of $2.7 billion. However, it's important to note that the surplus was not solely due to the actions of one governor, as it resulted from a combination of factors including economic growth, budget cuts, and tax increases. Therefore, while the claim is largely accurate, it's not entirely fair to attribute the entire turnaround to one person's actions.",mostly true,True,False
