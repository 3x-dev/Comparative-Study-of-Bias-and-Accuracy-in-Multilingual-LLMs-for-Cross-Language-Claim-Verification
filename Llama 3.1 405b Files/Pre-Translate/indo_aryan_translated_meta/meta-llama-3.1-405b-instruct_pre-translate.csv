"Photo by George Floyd, who recently died in police torture in Miniapolis, USA",mostly false,bn,"I cannot verify if George Floyd took the photo in question. However, I can confirm that George Floyd did die in an incident involving police in Minneapolis, USA, on May 25, 2020. His death sparked widespread protests and discussions about police brutality and racial injustice. The incident was widely reported and documented, and it is not accurate to describe it as ""police torture"" as the circumstances of his death were more complex and involved a restraint technique that led to asphyxiation, as confirmed by medical examiners.

"In this video, producer-director Mahesh Bhatt is expressing displeasure for the trailer of the film 'Sadak 2' to be displayed on a large scale.",false,hi,"To assess the claim, I would need more context or information about Mahesh Bhatt's reaction to the trailer of 'Sadak 2' being displayed on a large scale. However, given the phrasing of the claim and without additional context, it suggests a specific scenario that may or may not accurately reflect Mahesh Bhatt's sentiments or actions regarding the promotion of 'Sadak 2'.

Since I don't have access to real-time data or specific statements from Mahesh Bhatt on this matter as of my last update, I must approach this claim with caution. The claim seems to imply a negative reaction from Mahesh Bhatt, which could be true or false depending on his actual statements or actions.

Without concrete evidence or a direct quote from Mahesh Bhatt expressing displeasure specifically about the trailer of 'Sadak 2' being displayed on a large scale, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim as true or false. However, given the lack of information to support the claim in the query, a cautious approach would lean towards questioning the accuracy of the claim.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
The Supreme Court has ruled that the country's name will be only India in every language from June 15,false,mr,"I couldn't find any information or credible sources confirming that the Supreme Court has made such a ruling. It's possible that the claim might be based on a misunderstanding, misinformation, or an unverified source.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
A picture of social media and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Reliance chief is being viral in Mukesh Ambani hugs.,half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, I would need more information or context about the specific picture being referred to, as well as any details surrounding the event or circumstances in which the picture was taken. Without this information, it's challenging to assess the truthfulness of the claim accurately.

However, based on the information provided and without further context or evidence, I must rely on general knowledge and the lack of specific details about such an event or picture. Given this, the claim cannot be verified as true or mostly true without additional evidence.

Therefore, the final answer, based on the lack of information and context, would lean towards the claim being potentially false or mostly false due to the absence of verifiable evidence or context to support it.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
This image of the Alaska mountain horn is lifted from the plane to look like a sleeping woman,mostly false,bn,"To assess the claim that an image of the Alaska mountain horn is lifted from a plane to look like a sleeping woman, we must consider the elements of the statement:

1. **Existence of the Image**: The claim implies the existence of a specific photograph or image. Without access to this image or further context, it's challenging to verify its existence directly.

2. **Perspective from a Plane**: The claim suggests the image was taken from an airplane, which is plausible given the advancements in aerial photography. However, without the image, we cannot confirm if it indeed looks like it was taken from such a vantage point.

3. **Resemblance to a Sleeping Woman**: This is the most subjective part of the claim. The interpretation of what constitutes a resemblance to a sleeping woman can vary greatly from person to person. Mountains and natural formations are often subject to pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon where people see patterns, images, or meanings in random or vague stimuli.

Given these considerations, without direct evidence of the image and its origin, and acknowledging the subjective nature of interpreting visual patterns, the claim cannot be definitively classified as true or false based on objective criteria. However, the lack of concrete evidence to support the claim and the subjective interpretation required to validate it lean towards a classification that suggests a degree of falsehood or at least a significant lack of verifiable truth.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
The Israeli Prime Minister's son's photo is serving in the army.,half true,hi,"To assess the claim that ""The Israeli Prime Minister's son's photo is serving in the army,"" we need to break down the statement and evaluate its components for accuracy and clarity.

1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim seems to imply that there is a photograph of the Israeli Prime Minister's son serving in the army. However, the phrasing is somewhat ambiguous, as it does not specify which Prime Minister or which son is being referred to. Israel has had several Prime Ministers, and without a specific name or timeframe, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact individual in question.

2. **General Practice in Israel**: In Israel, military service is compulsory for most citizens, with some exceptions based on religious, physical, or psychological grounds. It is common for the children of politicians, including Prime Ministers, to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Therefore, it's plausible that a son of an Israeli Prime Minister would serve in the army.

3. **Public Figures and Military Service**: The sons of Israeli Prime Ministers serving in the IDF is not unprecedented. For example, the sons of Benjamin Netanyahu, who served as Prime Minister for several terms, have been in the IDF. However, without a specific reference to which Prime Minister's son is being discussed, it's difficult to verify the claim directly.

4. **The Role of a Photo**: The mention of a ""photo"" serving in the army is clearly a misunderstanding or miscommunication. Photos cannot serve in the army; the claim likely intends to refer to the person depicted in the photo serving in the army.

Given these considerations, the claim as stated is confusing and lacks specificity. However, the underlying assertion that a son of an Israeli Prime Minister has served or is serving in the IDF is plausible and aligns with the country's norms regarding military service. The ambiguity and the literal interpretation of the claim as written (a photo serving in the army) lead to confusion.

Therefore, without more specific information to directly confirm or deny the claim regarding a particular individual, the best assessment based on the phrasing provided would lean towards the claim being misleading due to its ambiguity and literal impossibility (photos cannot serve in the army).

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Photo ship is the world's largest ship,mostly false,bn,"To verify the claim, I need to check if there is a ship called ""Photo ship"" and if it is indeed the world's largest ship.

After conducting research, I couldn't find any information about a ship called ""Photo ship"" being the world's largest ship. In fact, I couldn't find any notable information about a ship with that name.

The world's largest ships are typically measured by their gross tonnage, deadweight tonnage, or length. According to various sources, the world's largest ships include the Seawise Giant (also known as the Knock Nevis), the Emma MÃ¦rsk, and the Symphony of the Seas, among others.

Since I couldn't find any credible information to support the claim, I conclude that it is false.

Final Answer: False.",false,False,False
"The Ghats of the Ganges river in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are filled with dirt.",mostly false,hi,"To verify the claim that ""The Ghats of the Ganges river in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are filled with dirt,"" we would ideally look at recent, reliable sources such as news articles, official reports, or credible social media posts that provide up-to-date information on the condition of the Ghats in Varanasi.

Varanasi, being a significant cultural and religious site, especially for Hindus, attracts a lot of attention for its maintenance and cleanliness, especially under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan initiative launched by the Indian government. The condition of the Ghats can change due to various factors such as seasonal variations, religious events, and government or local initiatives for cleanliness.

Without access to current, specific data or reports directly addressing the cleanliness of the Ghats at the time of the query, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

However, considering the general efforts towards cleanliness and the importance of Varanasi, it might be expected that there would be ongoing efforts to maintain the Ghats. Yet, the claim specifically mentions they are ""filled with dirt,"" which could be an exaggeration or a reflection of a particular moment in time rather than a constant state.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to support or refute the claim at the time of the query, a cautious approach would be to consider the statement as potentially 'Half True' because it's likely that some areas might have issues with cleanliness at any given time, but it's unlikely that all Ghats are constantly ""filled with dirt.""

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Indian Army is harassing Kashmiri women,mostly false,hi,"I can provide information on the topic. There have been allegations and reports of human rights abuses, including harassment of Kashmiri women, by the Indian Army in Jammu and Kashmir. These allegations have been documented by various human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

For example, a 2019 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the situation of human rights in Kashmir noted that there were allegations of ""widespread and serious human rights violations"" by the Indian security forces, including ""excessive use of force, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, and enforced disappearances."" The report also noted that women in Kashmir were ""particularly vulnerable"" to human rights abuses.

However, it's also worth noting that the Indian government has consistently denied these allegations, and has stated that the Indian Army is committed to upholding human rights in Kashmir.

Given the conflicting information and the complexity of the issue, I would classify the claim as ""Half True."" While there are certainly allegations and reports of human rights abuses, including harassment of Kashmiri women, by the Indian Army, the extent and nature of these abuses are disputed.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
