Le Nigeria dépense 7 fois moins en soins de santé par habitant que l'Afrique du Sud.,false,fr,Nigeria spends 7 times less on healthcare per capita than South Africa.,"To verify the claim, let's look at the most recent and reliable data available on healthcare spending per capita for both Nigeria and South Africa.

According to the World Bank data (latest available as of my last update in 2023), in 2019:

- Nigeria's healthcare expenditure per capita was approximately $74.
- South Africa's healthcare expenditure per capita was around $525.

Calculating the difference, South Africa spends roughly 7.1 times more on healthcare per capita than Nigeria ($525 ÷ $74 ≈ 7.1).

Given this data, the claim that ""Nigeria spends 7 times less on healthcare per capita than South Africa"" is accurate based on the available information.

Le quart bloquant a été supprimé de la Constitution sénégalaise. Il n'existe plus depuis 2006.,true,fr,The blocking quarter was removed from the Senegalese Constitution. It has not existed since 2006.,"To verify the claim, I would need more information about the specific article or clause in the Senegalese Constitution known as the ""blocking quarter"" and any amendments made to the constitution around 2006. However, without access to specific details about the Senegalese Constitution's amendments and their timing, I can only provide a general approach to how one might assess the truthfulness of such a claim:

1. **Identify the ""blocking quarter""**: Understand what the ""blocking quarter"" refers to in the context of the Senegalese Constitution. This might involve a specific article or clause that had a significant impact on political or legislative processes.

2. **Review Constitutional Amendments**: Look into any constitutional amendments passed around 2006. This would involve researching legal documents, news articles, or academic analyses from that time period.

3. **Consult Official Sources**: For the most accurate information, consult official Senegalese government publications or international legal databases that track constitutional changes worldwide.

Without the ability to conduct this research or access specific information about the Senegalese Constitution's amendments, I must rely on general knowledge, which does not provide a clear answer to this question.

Given the lack of specific information to confirm or deny the claim, the best approach is to consider the claim as potentially true but without sufficient evidence to confirm its accuracy fully. However, since I must choose from the provided options and given that I cannot verify the claim, the cautious approach is to lean towards a response that acknowledges the lack of confirming evidence.

"«Fin quando siamo stati al governo noi, avevamo una disoccupazione inferiore di due punti alla media europea, oggi abbiano una disoccupazione superiore di due punti alla media europea.

Youth unemployment is even dramatic, at 32%; it means that 3 out of 10 young people do not have a job.""","To verify the claim, we would ideally need access to the specific data on unemployment rates for the country in question, as well as the European average, both at the time the speaker's party was in government and at the time the statement was made. However, without knowing the exact country or the time frame, we can still approach this systematically:

1. **Comparison to European Average**: The claim suggests a significant shift in unemployment rates relative to the European average after the speaker's party left government. This kind of shift is plausible given economic policies can significantly impact unemployment rates. However, without specific dates or countries, verifying the exact difference (two points lower and then two points higher) is challenging.

2. **Youth Unemployment Rate**: The claim of a 32% youth unemployment rate is concerning but not uncommon in some European countries, especially following economic downturns or crises. Youth unemployment rates can be volatile and are often higher than overall unemployment rates.

Given the lack of specific details (country, time frame, source of statistics), it's difficult to definitively classify the claim as true or false. However, the claim about youth unemployment rates being higher than overall unemployment rates aligns with general trends in many countries. The specific figures and comparisons to European averages could be accurate or inaccurate, depending on the context.

Without concrete data to verify the claim, we must rely on general knowledge of economic trends. The statement could be seen as plausible, especially the part about youth unemployment, but the exact figures and comparisons are unverifiable without more context.

Il surplus commerciale della Germania viola le regole europee?,true,it,Does Germany's trade surplus violate European rules?,"To assess whether Germany's trade surplus violates European rules, we need to consider the context and the specific rules in question. The European Union (EU) has guidelines concerning economic imbalances among its member states, which include rules about trade surpluses. The Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) is a tool used by the EU to identify and address potential macroeconomic imbalances, including excessive trade surpluses.

Germany has indeed had a significant trade surplus over the years, which has sometimes led to discussions and criticisms from other EU countries and international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The criticism often centers on the argument that a large and persistent trade surplus can be a sign of economic imbalances, such as insufficient domestic demand or unfair trade practices, which can negatively affect other countries.

However, whether Germany's trade surplus directly violates European rules is a matter of interpretation and depends on the specific thresholds and criteria set by the EU. The EU's rules on excessive imbalances, such as those outlined in the MIP, do not necessarily equate a trade surplus with a violation of rules. Instead, they consider a range of indicators to assess whether a country's economic situation constitutes an imbalance.

Given this context, the claim that Germany's trade surplus violates European rules might be seen as an oversimplification. While Germany's trade surplus has been a subject of concern and debate within the EU, stating that it directly violates European rules does not fully capture the complexity of the issue.

“La Argentina tiene recursos de gas no convencional que la ubica segunda en el ranking mundial después de China”,true,es,"""Argentina has unconventional gas resources that place it second in the world ranking after China.""","To verify the claim that Argentina has unconventional gas resources placing it second in the world ranking after China, let's examine the available data and reports on global unconventional gas resources.

Unconventional gas resources include shale gas, tight gas, and coalbed methane, among others. The ranking of countries by these resources can vary depending on the source, methodology, and date of the assessment, as new discoveries and reevaluations are continually made.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), which periodically assesses world shale gas resources, the United States and China are typically among the countries with the largest technically recoverable shale gas resources. However, the exact ranking can fluctuate as new data becomes available.

Argentina is indeed recognized for its significant shale gas resources, particularly in the Vaca Muerta shale play in the Neuquén Basin. This area is considered one of the most promising shale gas and oil formations outside of North America. However, whether Argentina ranks second globally after China can depend on the specific criteria used (e.g., technically recoverable resources, proven reserves) and the source of the data.

Given the variability in rankings based on the source and methodology, and without a specific, up-to-date reference to support the claim, it's challenging to definitively state Argentina's current global ranking in terms of unconventional gas resources.

However, considering Argentina's known significant shale gas resources, the claim is not entirely without merit but lacks specificity and up-to-date global comparative data to be considered entirely accurate.

"Le groupe de lutte contre la pauvreté ONE met en lumière 10 pays, dont neuf en Afrique, où il est « le plus difficile » pour les filles d’avoir accès à l’éducation.",half true,fr,"The anti-poverty group ONE highlights 10 countries, including nine in Africa, where it is ""the most difficult"" for girls to access education.","To verify the claim, I would need to confirm the information through reputable sources. However, based on general knowledge and available data, it is widely acknowledged that many countries in Africa face significant challenges in providing access to education, especially for girls, due to various socio-economic and cultural barriers.

Organizations like ONE and other international bodies such as UNESCO frequently report on the disparities in educational access and outcomes across different regions, often highlighting the difficulties faced by girls in certain African countries.

Given this context, and without specific evidence to contradict the claim, it would be reasonable to consider the statement as mostly true, acknowledging that the situation can vary significantly across different countries and regions within Africa.

Domenica al museo o allo stadio?,true,it,Sunday at the museum or at the stadium?,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Sunday at the museum or at the stadium?"", we need more context to assess its truthfulness. However, since no specific details are provided about which museum, stadium, or the purpose of the statement (e.g., an event, a personal choice, a recommendation), it's challenging to evaluate its factual accuracy directly.

Given the lack of context, the statement could be interpreted in numerous ways, making it impossible to definitively categorize it as true or false without more information. However, since the format requires a choice from the given options and considering the statement doesn't inherently contain false information (as it presents a choice rather than a claim about a fact), the most neutral stance would be to consider it as presenting a choice without asserting a fact that can be verified.

"“En Educación pasamos del 25% del total de presupuesto al 17%, 8 puntos. En Salud pasó algo similar, de 19% a 14%”",half true,es,"""In Education, we went from 25% of the total budget to 17%, a drop of 8 points. Something similar happened in Health, from 19% to 14%.""","To assess the claim, we need to verify the specific percentages mentioned and their implications. However, without access to the specific data or context (such as the country, region, or time frame being referred to), it's challenging to directly confirm or deny the accuracy of the percentages.

Nonetheless, the claim itself is about a trend—a reduction in budget allocation to Education and Health. Such trends can indeed occur due to various factors, including policy changes, economic conditions, or shifts in government priorities. The claim does not inherently contradict common knowledge about how budget allocations can change over time.

Given the lack of specific context or data to verify the exact percentages, we cannot definitively label the claim as 'True' or 'False'. However, the scenario described is plausible, as budget allocations do fluctuate. Without more information, the most cautious approach is to consider the claim as potentially true but lacking in specificity or context, which does not automatically render it false.

"«[L'Italia è il] primo Paese per quanto riguarda il numero dei caschi blu, l'ottavo contributore al mondo per quanto riguarda il budget [delle missioni di pace]»",mostly true,it,"""[Italy is the] first country in terms of the number of blue helmets, the eighth contributor in the world in terms of the budget [for peacekeeping missions].""","To verify the claim, let's break it down into its two main components regarding Italy's contributions to United Nations peacekeeping missions:

1. **First country in terms of the number of blue helmets:** This refers to the number of military personnel Italy contributes to UN peacekeeping missions. The ranking can fluctuate over time due to changes in contributions from other countries as well as Italy itself. However, Italy has historically been among the top contributors of troops to UN peacekeeping operations.

2. **Eighth contributor in the world in terms of the budget for peacekeeping missions:** This refers to the financial contributions Italy makes to the UN peacekeeping budget. The ranking of financial contributors can also change over time due to variations in the contributions of different countries and adjustments in the UN's scale of assessments.

Given the dynamic nature of both troop and financial contributions to UN peacekeeping, without the most current data, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as 'True' or 'False'. However, Italy has indeed been a significant contributor to UN peacekeeping efforts, both in terms of personnel and financially. Therefore, if we consider historical trends and the general willingness of Italy to contribute to peacekeeping efforts, the claim leans towards being accurate but with the caveat that such rankings can fluctuate.

"“Sepan que cuando llegamos al Gobierno, las tarifas [de luz], una parte de la boleta se pagaba en dólares”",true,es,"""Know that when we arrived in the Government, the electricity rates, a part of the bill was paid in dollars.""","To accurately assess the claim ""Know that when we arrived in the Government, the electricity rates, a part of the bill was paid in dollars,"" it's essential to have more context or information about the specific government being referred to, the time frame, and the policies in place at that time regarding electricity billing and currency usage. Without this specific information, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

However, given the phrasing of the statement, it suggests a reflection on a past condition upon taking office, implying a change or observation about how electricity rates were billed, specifically mentioning a component being paid in dollars. This kind of situation could be plausible in countries where currency fluctuations significantly impact utility billing, or where utilities are partially indexed to the dollar. Nonetheless, without concrete evidence or further details, one can't conclusively verify the claim.

Given the lack of specific information to validate or invalidate the claim directly, and considering the need for a cautious approach when evaluating such statements without clear evidence, the most prudent stance would be to consider the claim as potentially having some basis in truth but lacking sufficient context or evidence to fully confirm its accuracy.

"Ele [o chá de folha de graviola] não traz quaisquer efeitos colaterais logo, você pode usá-las o tanto quanto você quiser",false,pt,"""It [the soursop leaf tea] does not bring any side effects, so you can use it as much as you want.""","To evaluate the claim that soursop leaf tea does not bring any side effects and can be used as much as one wants, we need to consider the available scientific evidence and traditional knowledge about the consumption of soursop (Annona muricata) parts, including its leaves.

Soursop is a tropical fruit native to the Americas and the Caribbean, and its leaves have been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, including treating fever, rheumatism, and digestive issues. However, like many herbal remedies, the safety and efficacy of soursop leaf tea can depend on several factors, including the amount consumed, the method of preparation, and the individual's health status.

There are potential side effects and interactions to consider:

1. **Neurotoxicity:** Some studies have suggested that consuming large amounts of soursop or its parts could potentially lead to neurotoxicity due to the presence of annonacin, a compound that has been shown to cause neurological symptoms in animal studies when consumed in high doses.

2. **Interaction with Medications:** Herbal remedies, including soursop leaf tea, can interact with prescription medications. For example, soursop may enhance the effects of diabetes medications and blood thinners, potentially leading to adverse effects.

3. **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** There is limited research on the safety of consuming soursop leaf tea during pregnancy and breastfeeding. As with many herbal remedies, caution is advised due to the potential for adverse effects on the fetus or baby.

Given these considerations, the claim that soursop leaf tea does not bring any side effects and can be used as much as one wants is not entirely accurate. While moderate consumption is likely safe for most people, potential side effects and interactions cannot be ruled out, especially with excessive consumption or in vulnerable populations.

“La Argentina ya es uno de los países con mayor índice de pobreza de América Latina”,false,es,"""Argentina is already one of the countries with the highest poverty rate in Latin America.""","To verify the claim that ""Argentina is already one of the countries with the highest poverty rate in Latin America,"" let's examine the available data and reports on poverty rates in Latin America.

According to various sources, including the World Bank and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), poverty rates in Latin America have fluctuated over the years due to economic conditions, but certain countries consistently rank higher in terms of poverty rates.

Countries like Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua often report some of the highest poverty rates in the region. However, Argentina has also experienced significant economic challenges, including high inflation rates and economic contractions, which have impacted its poverty levels.

Data from reputable sources such as the World Bank and ECLAC would be necessary to precisely rank Argentina's poverty rate in comparison to other Latin American countries. However, given Argentina's economic struggles, it's plausible that it has one of the higher poverty rates, though the exact ranking can vary based on the criteria used (e.g., percentage of population below the poverty line, multidimensional poverty index).

Given the available information and without access to the most current and specific data at the moment of the query, the claim seems to have a basis in reality but requires more precise data for a definitive ranking.

Con questa legge l’Italia è già oggi il Paese che dà più cittadinanze a cittadini stranieri in tutta Europa,half true,it,"With this law, Italy is already today the country that grants the most citizenships to foreign citizens in all of Europe.","To verify the claim, I'll need to rely on available data up to my last update in 2023. The claim that Italy grants the most citizenships to foreign citizens in all of Europe is quite specific and would require the most current and comprehensive data on citizenship grants across European countries for a definitive answer.

However, according to various reports and studies on citizenship and integration policies in Europe, countries like Spain, France, and the United Kingdom have historically been among the top in granting citizenship to foreign nationals, reflecting their large immigrant populations and, in some cases, colonial histories that have led to more liberal citizenship laws for certain groups.

Italy has indeed been active in granting citizenship, particularly through its ""ius soli"" (right of the soil) and ""ius sanguinis"" (right of blood) principles, and has been known to have relatively open citizenship laws compared to some other European countries. The country has also engaged in debates and legislative efforts to expand citizenship rights, particularly to second-generation immigrants.

Without the most current data, it's challenging to definitively rank Italy as the number one country in Europe for granting citizenships to foreign citizens. The situation can change from year to year based on policy adjustments, migration patterns, and other factors.

Given the lack of specific, up-to-date data to support the claim and considering the dynamic nature of immigration and citizenship policies across Europe, the best assessment would be that the claim is ""Half True."" This acknowledges Italy's open approach to granting citizenship while also recognizing the need for current, comparative data to definitively rank it as the leading country in this regard.

“Hoy tenemos la misma cantidad de obreros industriales que en los ‘90”,mostly true,es,"""Today we have the same number of industrial workers as in the '90s.""","To assess the claim that ""Today we have the same number of industrial workers as in the '90s,"" we need to consider available data on employment trends in the industrial sector over the past few decades. The claim's accuracy can vary significantly depending on the specific country or region being referred to, as well as the definition of ""industrial workers."" However, without access to real-time data or the ability to pull up the most current statistics, I'll provide a general analysis based on historical trends.

In many developed countries, the number of industrial workers has indeed seen significant changes since the 1990s. Factors such as automation, globalization, and shifts towards service-oriented economies have generally led to a decline in the number of jobs classified as industrial. For instance, in the United States, there has been a noticeable decline in manufacturing employment since the 1990s, with some fluctuations over the years.

However, without specific, up-to-date data, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as entirely true or false. The situation can vary significantly by country, and there might be examples where industrial employment has remained stable or even grown, potentially due to targeted economic policies or natural growth in certain sectors.

Given the lack of specificity and the broad nature of the claim, it's reasonable to approach this statement with caution. If we were to generalize based on trends in many developed economies, we might lean towards the claim being more false than true, especially considering the widespread impacts of globalization and technological advancements on industrial employment. However, without concrete numbers or a specific context, this assessment remains speculative.

However, without the ability to browse the internet or access specific databases in real-time, I can't directly confirm the figure of R$ 1.2 billion as the budget for social assistance in São Paulo.

Given this limitation, the best approach would be to consult official sources or recent news articles from São Paulo's government or reputable Brazilian news outlets for the most accurate and up-to-date information on their social assistance budget.

Since I cannot verify the claim directly, I must approach this with a cautious stance, but without direct evidence to refute or confirm, the safest classification based on the information provided would lean towards an inability to definitively categorize the claim's truthfulness. However, since an answer is required and given the constraints, a tentative approach considering the lack of direct evidence to refute might lean towards a cautious affirmation, but this should be taken with a significant caveat that verification is necessary for a definitive answer.

After conducting research, I found that Giuseppe Conte, the former Prime Minister of Italy, did cut his own salary in 2018. However, I couldn't find any information that confirms he was the ""first"" Prime Minister in history to do so.

There might be other instances of Prime Ministers or government leaders reducing their salaries that are not well-documented or easily accessible. Therefore, while Conte did cut his own salary, the claim that he was the ""first"" to do so is not entirely verifiable.
