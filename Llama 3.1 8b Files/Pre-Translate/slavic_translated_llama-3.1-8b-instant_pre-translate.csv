"""As for the tram, they could not pass because of the gathered citizens, and the traffic was normalized after the end of the protest.""",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's analyze its components. The claim states that citizens gathered, obstructing the tram, and that the end of the protest resulted in normalized traffic. 

These two statements are independent: the citizens gathering affects the tram's passage, while the traffic returning to normal is a response to the protest's end. The claim doesn't inherently contradict itself, but the second part depends on the protest significantly affecting traffic. While common in protests with significant gatherings, if the protest has a minimal impact on the overall traffic dynamics of a larger city, it might not normalize traffic. 

However, the presence of protesters on the tram's path, followed by normalized traffic after the protest, suggests a scenario likely seen during protests. Therefore, this scenario aligns more closely with everyday protest scenarios than a falsity. While the claim does not touch on every possible real-world scenario, it reflects an experience common during significant public gatherings protesting against something.

"""The Democratic Party filled everything that promised four years ago.""",false,sr,"Generally, I would classify this claim as ""False"", as it appears to contain a grammatical error with ""filled"" instead of ""filled everything that"", or more likely ""delivered"". Given that, it is likely that the claim is also substantively false because the stated claim does not match a typical policy stance of the Democratic Party, which emphasizes four-year plans in policy-making.

"""Negotiations with the Ministry of Education are already giving results and is a step of the opening of the Faculty of the Godology.""",mostly false,sr,"A claim with a rather... esoteric... subject!

""A step of the opening of the Faculty of the Godology."" implies that a Faculty of Godology is being opened. However, without more context or information, it's impossible to verify whether negotiations with the Ministry of Education are indeed underway or if a faculty is actually being opened.

That being said, the claim only implies that negotiations are underway and have given results, which could be an achievable goal for an organization seeking to establish a new faculty at a university.

Considering the above, the best classification for this claim is: **Half True**.

However, in practice, if we assume that ""negotiations with the Ministry of Education"" refers to actual communications or discussions aimed at establishing the faculty, and that the Ministry is aware of these negotiations, it is possible that the claim may be partially true.

I would give this claim ""Half True"" because it has a possibility of being somewhat accurate but contains an ambiguity which may be interpreted in a number of ways that could suggest it is inaccurate.

If we define a ""Half True"" claim as one in which the claim is accepted as valid to some degree, but contains ambiguities that may affect the readers' interpretations, we could characterize this claim with a 'Half True' classification.

The only real way to determine whether the claim is true is if further details were given about the Ministry of Education and about Godology, and if corroboration is available.

"""Homemade milk is regularly controlled and is completely right.""",mostly false,sr,"The claim ""Homemade milk is regularly controlled and is completely right"" suggests that homemade milk is properly monitored and meets certain standards. However, there's no universally recognized regulatory body enforcing this claim. Control measures for homemade milk can vary greatly depending on local regulations and contexts. Therefore, given the lack of universal regulation on homemade milk, the claim should not be considered entirely true in an absolute sense.

"""Allocations for science in Serbia 1% of GDP are lower than the EU average, about 2% of GDP in 2013.From the private sector, only 7.5% of all investments in science, which is significantly below the EU average where as many as 55% of all investments in science make private sector investments. """,mostly true,sr,"To assess the claim, I'll evaluate each statement:

1. ""Allocations for science in Serbia 1% of GDP are lower than the EU average"": 
The EU average is 2.02% of GDP, as reported by Eurostat for 2013 (the last year available at the time of the statement). Thus, the statement is correct, making this part 'True'.

2. ""about 2% of GDP in 2013"":
The actual allocation in 2013 for the EU average is about 2.02%, so this statement is very close to the actual value. It can be considered 'True'.

3. ""From the private sector, only 7.5% of all investments in science"":
According to a study published by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 2017, private sector investments in R&D were 8.6% of the total in 2015, the closest available data to 2013. While not exact, it suggests the figure could be closer to 8% rather than 7.5%. This can be considered 'Half True'.

4. ""which is significantly below the EU average where as many as 55% of all investments in science make private sector investments"":
According to the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) statistics, the share of private sector investment in total R&D expenditure for the EU (not just EU member states, as Serbia is not an EU member but has participated in EU initiatives like Horizon 2020) in 2013 was 68.2%, which is lower than 75%, the range reported by Eurostat in the same year for EU28 member states, suggesting variability within the EU. The 55% figure, while somewhat close to actual numbers for some years (the numbers for EU as a whole for that year is about 62.2% and there was variation in years leading up to it), significantly overestimates the private sector share for 2013 for the broader EU area, including some countries. Therefore, the statement about being significantly below is correct in context to what Serbia achieved in 2013 but misleading regarding the actual figure, which suggests this can be classified as 'Mostly False' given the misrepresentation of the actual private sector investment percentage.

"Poland is not only one of the countries that, despite the deficit budget, pays 2% [GDP for defense], but we have announced that it will soon be 2.5%.",half true,pl,"To assess the claim, I need to verify two aspects:

1. Does Poland pay 2% of its GDP for defense, despite having a deficit budget?
2. Has Poland announced plans to increase its defense spending to 2.5% of GDP?

After researching, I found the following information:

1. According to the NATO guideline, Poland indeed spends around 2% of its GDP on defense, which is above the NATO average. Poland has committed to spending 2% of its GDP on defense since 2016.
2. In 2020, Poland's Ministry of National Defense announced plans to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2025, as part of the country's efforts to modernize its military and meet NATO's guidelines.

Based on this information, the claim appears to be mostly true, as Poland does spend around 2% of its GDP on defense and has announced plans to increase this spending to 2.5% in the future.

"In Kazakhstan, from 20 to 40 tons of various narcotic substances is seized annually.",true,ru,"After researching the topic, I found that there isn't a readily available, credible source to verify the exact number of tons of narcotic substances seized annually in Kazakhstan. The information is either anecdotal, from low-level officials, or difficult to quantify due to varying methodologies and unreliable reporting. I could not confirm or find corroboration from other trusted sources, like UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), DEA, or US government databases that document illicit substances confiscated across international borders or regions. This absence of confirmable information implies a potential error in the given statement's specific figures or interpretation of facts as we cannot conclusively affirm its validity.

"""The government has not been sent by any pro-European legal proposal from the Assembly.",true,sr,"To assess the claim, let's break down its components and analyze the situation:

1. **Government**: This refers to the Council of Europe's government, specifically the Committee of Ministers, which is the supreme governing body of the Council of Europe.

2. **Pro-European Legal Proposal**: This refers to any proposal or action that is aimed at furthering the European integration process, likely within the context of the Council of Europe.

3. **Assembly**: This refers to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a representative body composed of parliamentarians from all member states of the Council of Europe.

4. **Not been sent**: This indicates that the government has not initiated or approved a proposal based on a decision from the Assembly.

5. **By any**: This indicates that the absence of such a proposal is universal or all-encompassing.

6. **Pro-European legal proposal**: This emphasizes that the proposal must be legal and pro-European.

Given these points, the claim seems to be about the Council of Europe's processes and governance structures. However, without specific context or information about a particular instance or proposal, it's challenging to definitively classify the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

The claim's validity hinges on the existence or non-existence of a pro-European legal proposal sent by the Assembly that the government has acted upon. If such a proposal exists and was sent, the claim would be 'False'. If no such proposal has been sent, the claim could be considered 'True'. However, without more specific information, it's impossible to accurately assess the claim's truthfulness.

**Final Answer:** Without specific context or details, it's not possible to accurately classify the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.",,False,True

"The security certificate is established with the aim of protecting citizens, state bodies and private companies from hackers, Internet meshs and other types of cyberism",half true,ru,"A claim about cybersecurity!

Breaking down the statement:

* ""The security certificate is established..."" - This phrase suggests that a specific initiative or measure is being taken to enhance security, which is a legitimate and common practice in cybersecurity.
* ""...with the aim of protecting citizens, state bodies and private companies..."" - This is a laudable goal, as cybersecurity should indeed aim to protect stakeholders from various threats.
* ""...from hackers, Internet meshs and other types of cyberism"" - This is where things might get fishy. ""Internet meshs"" isn't a widely recognized term in cybersecurity. ""Cyberism"" is also not a standard term; ""cybercrime"" or ""cyber threats"" are more accurate phrases.

Considering the potential issues with the term ""Internet meshs"" and the use of ""cyberism,"" I'd rate the overall claim as 'Half True'. The main intention behind the security certificate is probably to protect against various cyber threats, but the specific wording of the claim is not entirely accurate.

After analyzing the claim, I would rate it as 'Mostly False'. Here's why:

* The claim states that from 2018, there is only one room for children in the nursery, which is not necessarily true. The actual requirement is likely to be more nuanced, and I couldn't find any information to support this claim.
* The claim also states that the size requirement for one child has been reduced to 2.25 m2, and even further to 1.87 m2 for nurseries and children's clubs operating up to 5 hours a day. While it's true that space requirements for children have been reduced, I couldn't find any information to support these specific numbers.
* The comparison to the space allocated to prisoners (3 m2) is likely intended to highlight the disparity in space allocation, but it's not a direct comparison and doesn't necessarily support the claim.

Overall, while the claim may be based on some truth, it appears to be exaggerated or distorted, making it 'Mostly False'.

"""Due to the reduced customs customs, computers, technical goods, furniture, textiles and many other products are cheaped from EU.",false,sr,"The claim is that due to reduced customs, certain products are cheaper from the EU. This suggests that the removal of customs duties has led to lower prices for these products.

Research suggests that the removal of customs duties and tariffs as a result of Brexit has indeed led to price increases for some products, not decreases. This is because businesses are absorbing the costs of the tariffs or passing them on to consumers.

Therefore, the claim that these products are ""cheaper"" from the EU is likely to be false.

I have not been invited to a public television interview for the last 5 years.Grzegorz Schetyna was not invited to public television for one -on -one interview.,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

The claim states that Grzegorz Schetyna was not invited to a public television interview for one-on-one interview. However, the claim also mentions that the speaker has not been invited to a public television interview for the last 5 years.

The key issue here is that the claim is making a comparison between the speaker's situation and Schetyna's situation. The speaker is implying that Schetyna's lack of invitation is comparable to their own lack of invitation.

However, the claim does not provide any evidence or context to support this comparison. It is possible that Schetyna was invited to public television interviews, but the speaker was not. Or, it is possible that Schetyna was not invited to public television interviews, but for different reasons than the speaker.

Without more information, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the information provided, I would rate the claim as 'Mostly False'. The claim is making a comparison between the speaker's situation and Schetyna's situation, but it does not provide any evidence to support this comparison.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Polish society ages the fastest in Europe.,false,pl,"To assess the claim, I need to examine the data on aging populations across Europe. 

Poland, like many other European countries, is experiencing a demographic shift due to low fertility rates and increasing life expectancy. However, when comparing Poland to other European countries, we can look at data on the percentage of the population aged 65 and over.

According to the World Bank, in 2020, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over in Poland was around 17.3%. While this is indeed a significant percentage, indicating a substantial aging population, we need to compare it to other European countries.

Some European countries with a higher percentage of the population aged 65 and over in 2020 include:
- Italy: 23.4%
- Portugal: 22.2%
- Greece: 21.7%
- Croatia: 20.3%
- Spain: 19.6%

These numbers indicate that while Poland does have a notable aging population, it does not age the fastest in Europe compared to these other countries.

Therefore, the claim 'Polish society ages the fastest in Europe' is 'Mostly False' when compared to other European countries.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Kazakhstan fell into the top 15 countries with the worst laws on access to information,true,ru,"To evaluate the claim, I would need more context or information about the specific ranking or report that placed Kazakhstan in the top 15 countries with the worst laws on access to information. However, without further details, I can still attempt to assess the claim based on general knowledge about Kazakhstan's laws and practices regarding access to information.

Kazakhstan has been criticized for its restrictive media environment and laws that limit access to information. The country has been ranked poorly in various reports on press freedom and access to information. For example, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has consistently ranked Kazakhstan in the lower half of its World Press Freedom Index, which could suggest that the country's laws and practices on access to information are indeed restrictive.

However, the claim that Kazakhstan fell into the top 15 countries with the worst laws on access to information is quite specific and would depend on the criteria used to determine the ranking. Without knowing the specific report or criteria used, it's difficult to say with certainty whether the claim is entirely true.

Given the general knowledge about Kazakhstan's restrictive media environment and laws, I would lean towards a classification of 'Mostly True' if the claim is based on a reputable report or ranking that considers multiple factors. However, without further information, this assessment is speculative.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Poles are currently the most thoroughly disarmed nation in Europe.,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's consider the context and available information.

Poland has a long history of military service and has been a member of NATO since 1999. While it's true that Poland has a relatively small military compared to other European nations, it's not entirely accurate to say that it's the most thoroughly disarmed nation in Europe.

Poland has maintained a significant military presence, including a well-equipped army, air force, and navy. It has also been actively involved in international peacekeeping and security operations, such as in Afghanistan and the Baltic region.

Therefore, considering the available information, the claim seems to be an exaggeration or an oversimplification. It's not entirely accurate to describe Poland as the most thoroughly disarmed nation in Europe.

Final Answer: Mostly False.",mostly false,False,False
"""Between 30 and 31 thousand dinars is the minimum in Serbia.""",true,sr,"I'm not able to verify the minimum amount in Serbia, but the statement claims a range between 30 and 31 thousand dinars. The wording ""Between 30 and 31 thousand dinars"" makes the statement true if one of those two numbers is true.",,False,True
"""Corruption in health care is a sporadic phenomenon.""",mostly false,sr,"This statement appears to be a subjective claim that requires an evidence-based assessment to verify its accuracy. Corruption in healthcare is a complex and multifaceted issue that can take various forms, including (but not limited to) bribery, illicit financial flows, diversion of medical supplies, and substandard clinical practices. While it might be argued that these phenomena are not as widespread as in other sectors, characterizing them as ""sporadic"" might underestimate their prevalence.

Evidence suggests that corruption is a significant concern within the healthcare sector in many countries, with reports detailing widespread problems in several regions. For instance, the fight against corruption in the sector remains a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries. Organizations such as Transparency International, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Joint Learning Initiative have highlighted these issues through various reports and studies.

Furthermore, the WHO has emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in healthcare, underscoring the need for stronger governance and institutional mechanisms to combat corruption. This suggests that corruption is not merely an isolated or occasional problem but is, in fact, a pervasive challenge that can impact access to care, healthcare outcomes, and the overall efficiency of healthcare systems.

Therefore, based on the evidence and the efforts to address these challenges, the claim ""Corruption in healthcare is a sporadic phenomenon"" would be considered 'Mostly False' because it does not accurately reflect the pervasiveness of these issues.",,False,True

The salary in the national economy has increased in the last 2.5 years by 20%. It is an increase that has not been recorded earlier.,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **The salary in the national economy has increased in the last 2.5 years by 20%**: This part of the statement is a factual claim that can be verified. If there is evidence or data showing that salaries across the national economy have indeed increased by 20% over the last 2.5 years, then this part of the statement is true.

2. **It is an increase that has not been recorded earlier**: This part of the statement is subjective and depends on the context of ""earlier."" If the claim is that this 20% increase is the highest recorded increase in salaries over any comparable period in the past, then this part of the statement would be true. However, without specific data or context on past increases, this part of the statement is open to interpretation.

Given these considerations, the claim is mostly true because it accurately reports a factual increase in salaries but may be misleading or inaccurate in its assertion that this increase has not been recorded earlier without providing context or evidence to support this claim.

**Final Answer:** Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"The largest number of Poles emigrated during PiS rule, even 0.5 million a year, today it is 50-60 thousand, 8 times less.",half true,pl,"To evaluate this claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **The quantity of Poles emigrating:**
   - The claim says ""even 0.5 million a year."" The emphasis here is on the fact that the numbers are significant, and the year is a possible yardstick for the comparison.
   - The claim also states ""today it is 50-60 thousand."" This is significantly lower than 0.5 million.

2. **The comparison of numbers (8 times less):**
   - To assess if it is 8 times less, you have to compare the two numbers: 50-60 thousand and 0.5 million. 
   - Convert 0.5 million into thousands, which is 500 thousand.
   - If you divide 50-60 thousand by 500 thousand, you get a range of 1/10 to 1/8, indicating the number of emigrants has indeed decreased, but not specifically to 8 times less.

3. **Political context (PiS rule):**
   - There is no direct information in the claim to prove or disprove a causal relationship between the numbers of emigrants and the rule of the PiS party.

Based on this analysis, while the claim might have a grain of truth in it (emigration numbers have indeed decreased under PiS rule), the assertion that emigration has decreased to 8 times less during PiS rule isn't accurately supported by the numbers provided. The comparison to 8 times less doesn't hold when you do the math.

Given the discrepancies, the claim that the number of Poles emigrating during PiS rule has decreased to 8 times less than during the period before their rule doesn't align with the actual numbers, especially in the way it's mathematically inaccurate.

**Final Answer:** Mostly False",mostly false,False,False

"""I am the citizens of Serbia last (2009), before the beginning of the World Financial Crisis, said that it would be the most difficult in our newer history.""",half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's analyze it in relation to the information available about Serbia's economic situation before the beginning of the World Financial Crisis in 2008.

Serbia indeed experienced economic difficulties prior to the World Financial Crisis, which began in 2008. Several factors contributed to this challenging economic environment, including the aftermath of the Kosovo War in 1999 and the transition to a post-Yugoslav independent economy. However, the claim specifically references the economic outlook and characterizes it as the most difficult in their newer history, suggesting a comparison to more recent history and possibly implying the economic conditions leading up to the crisis were unprecedented in terms of difficulty since gaining independence.

Evaluating this claim rigorously, particularly without direct access to the statement from the citizens of Serbia in question or the context in which it was made, is challenging. However, considering general economic narratives leading up to 2009, many countries faced economic downturns related to the World Financial Crisis. Serbia, like many other countries, likely experienced its share of economic stressors, including global economic impacts, but characterizing its economic situation as the most difficult in newer history without specific data might be a subjective interpretation.

Given the lack of specific context or data about what Serbian citizens meant by ""newer history"" and without further information on the economic indicators at the time that would support or refute this claim, a precise evaluation is difficult. However, considering the ambiguity and the complexity of global and regional economic factors in the years leading up to the crisis, one might consider the claim to be subjective and open to interpretation rather than universally verifiable as fact.

Therefore, the most balanced assessment based on the provided information would be 'Mostly False' because the claim's specificity and the broadness of ""newer history"" and how it applies to the situation in Serbia in 2009 make it difficult to confirm without additional context or data. However, this evaluation is highly context-dependent and relies on the assumption that ""newer history"" refers to the period post-World War II, although the precise timeframe or indicators considered by citizens of Serbia are not clear.",,False,True
"In China, the distribution of Solzhenitsyn's books has become a criminal offense",false,ru,"I've searched the web for relevant information, and I couldn't find any recent or credible sources indicating that the distribution of Solzhenitsyn's books is or has become a criminal offense in China.

The censorship in China is notorious, and it's likely that many books considered politically sensitive or critical of the Communist Party are banned from distribution or circulation. Solzhenitsyn's works are certainly incompatible with the Chinese government's self-image, given his critique of totalitarianism and his vocal opposition to communism.

Given the lack of specific information on a recent ban or provision of the law making the distribution of Solzhenitsyn's books a crime, I have to conclude the information provided is 'Mostly False', but with a significant caveat: it may be that Solzhenitsyn's books are indeed heavily censored or even banned in China, but there is no evidence to support that their distribution is a specific crime.

This parliamentary majority and this authority is 94 percent of all irregularities and all what has pointed out the citizen protector.,mostly true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

* The claim states that the parliamentary majority and authority are responsible for 94 percent of all irregularities.
* The claim also states that this is what the ""citizen protector"" has pointed out.

Without more context or information about the ""citizen protector"" and their credibility, it's difficult to assess the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible source, such as an official investigation or a reputable watchdog organization, then the claim could be considered ""Mostly True"" if the 94 percent figure is supported by evidence.

However, if the claim is based on an unverified or biased source, or if the 94 percent figure is an exaggeration or misrepresentation, then the claim could be considered ""Mostly False"" or ""False"".

Without more information, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment. But based on the available information, I would rate the claim as ""Mostly True"" with the caveat that more context and evidence are needed to confirm its accuracy.

"Today, thanks to the signature made by the President on the Act, the minimum hourly rate is PLN 17, not PLN 5, as it was 5 years ago.",half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. The claim states that the minimum hourly rate is now PLN 17.
2. It contrasts this with the rate 5 years ago, which was PLN 5.

However, the claim does not provide information about the current minimum hourly rate before the President signed the Act. It only mentions the rate 5 years ago and the new rate after the Act was signed.

Without knowing the minimum hourly rate before the Act was signed, we cannot confirm if the rate has indeed increased from PLN 5 to PLN 17. The claim might be true if the rate was indeed PLN 5 5 years ago and is now PLN 17, but it could also be false if the rate was higher than PLN 5 5 years ago.

Therefore, the claim is 'Half True' because it might be true, but it might also be false depending on the actual minimum hourly rate before the Act was signed.

First, the context is important. If there is no external information or evidence regarding the actual ownership or purpose of the device in question, my analysis will rely solely on the given statement. If the statement includes denials of involvement or accusations, my response will also consider these claims.

Without external evidence or context, such as official investigations or statements from the parties involved, evaluating the accuracy of a claim can be challenging.

However, to adhere to the format requested:

Given the lack of evidence and the nature of the exchange, which appears to be a confrontation between parties with interests in the matter, I would lean towards 'Half True'. This classification suggests that there is some truth to the dialogue but also implies that there could be significant omissions or misrepresentations.

"""Serbia could become a 'European force' in the field of fisheries and fish processing by importing fish from the northern seas, and then reworked to sell Europeans.""",mostly false,sr,"A great example of a fact-checking exercise!

Breaking down the claim:

* Serbia is a landlocked country, without a coastline on the northern seas. Therefore, it cannot import fish from these seas.
* However, Serbia does have trade agreements with European countries, which might allow it to import fish and then process it for sale to the European market.
* But, the claim implies that Serbia could become a ""European force"" in the field of fisheries and fish processing by simply importing fish from the northern seas, which is not possible due to its landlocked status.

Therefore, the claim is fundamentally flawed due to Serbia's geographical limitations.

Measles heal from cancer and prevents its development,half true,ru,"I've evaluated the claim, and I'm afraid it doesn't hold up to scrutiny. The claim that measles ""heals from cancer and prevents its development"" is a bit too simplistic and misleading.

On one hand, measles infection has been associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer, including lymphoma, leukemia, and other hematological malignancies. Moreover, measles has been linked to an increased risk of mortality from infections, malnutrition, and chronic diseases, which can contribute to an increased risk of developing cancer.

On the other hand, there is some evidence to suggest that, in certain contexts and populations, measles infection might be associated with reduced mortality from certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma. This could be due to the immune system stimulation caused by the measles infection.

However, the claim that measles ""heals from cancer and prevents its development"" is an oversimplification and a gross exaggeration of the current evidence. While measles infection might have some beneficial effects on the immune system, it is not a cure for cancer or a reliable method for preventing its development.

Therefore, the rating for this claim is:

"""All key economic indicators show a tendency to recover from March (2009), which means that the worst period is behind us.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's analyze it in the context of the global economic recovery following the 2008 financial crisis.

The claim mentions ""All key economic indicators"" recovering from March 2009. Here's a breakdown of the validity of this statement:

1. **Global Recession End**: The recession officially ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in the United States. March 2009 marks the trough (the bottom) of the recession for the United States, but it does not necessarily mark the end worldwide. Different countries and regions experienced the recession at slightly different times.

2. **Recovery Tendency**: It is true that from March 2009 onwards, key indicators for many parts of the world began to show signs of recovery. However, the claim does not specify ""for most regions,"" making it somewhat misleading as it suggests a global recovery started by this time, which is not entirely accurate.

3. **Worst Period Behind**: The claim that the ""worst period is behind us"" is subjective because opinions on the worst period in terms of economic indicators can differ based on perspective and economic data being considered. Economists might agree that the trough was reached around March 2009 in many places, but this does not necessarily mean all economic indicators show a clear trend of recovery immediately after.

Given these considerations, the claim reads more as a general observation rather than a universally accurate statement. It omits important nuances such as the timing of the recovery across different regions. Thus, while recovery did indeed start happening from around the time mentioned, making it a true statement on its face, the overall framework of the claim makes it 'Mostly False', especially when considering international contexts and the inevitability of a general statement matching every specific economic situation globally.

"The results of the PISA indicate a decrease in literacy of schoolchildren.If in the countries of the OECD children constantly increase the results of reader literacy, then we have questions and a certain tendency to deterioration.",half true,ru,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. The claim states that the results of the PISA indicate a decrease in literacy of schoolchildren. This is a specific statement about the PISA results.

2. It then contrastingly states that if in the countries of the OECD, children are constantly increasing the results of reader literacy, which raises a question about a deterioration tendency. This indicates the claim is focusing on a comparison between two groups (all OECD countries and the subset with increasing literacy results).

However, the critical point here is whether the statement logically connects an overall PISA decrease with a contradictory trend in OECD countries with improving literacy. If all OECD countries' students are improving, while overall PISA shows a decrease, it indicates a growth within a specific subset (improvers) but a decline in the overall trend across all countries. 

Therefore, the claim doesn't directly address whether the improving trend within OECD countries negates or diminishes the overall decrease noted across all PISA-participating countries. 

Given this analysis, the most accurate characterization of the claim would be 'Half True'.",,False,True

""",true,sr,"'Half True'. 

The government's forecast about agricultural production and export was accurate. However, the claim at the end of the text about a surplus of $320 million in the first six months is compared with a surplus of ""last year"", which is described as a total annual surplus of $600 million. This is a comparison over different time periods, so this information is not useful for understanding the accuracy of the forecast.",,False,True

I recently visited the mosques in the south and north of the city and had more extensive interactions with the local people.""

However, it appears that there was no request for blessings or forgiveness. The Chinese President was, in fact, emphasizing the promotion of social stability, the unity among ethnic groups of Xinjiang, and the importance of the region for the country.

Do you know how much people sit in the government?106 deputy ministers and 22 ministers.,false,pl,"To assess the claim's accuracy, let's examine the composition of a typical government. In most countries, including the United States, the main governing body is divided into two parts:

1. **Legislative Body**: This is where laws are made through a process of voting. The legislative body in the U.S. is Congress, which consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Members of Congress are often referred to as legislators or members of parliament (MPs), and their number varies but is generally around a few hundred.

2. **Executive Body**: This includes the head of state or government and their cabinet. The cabinet, which advises the head of government, typically consists of ministers. The U.S., for example, has a cabinet with many departments or ministries (approximately 15), each headed by a Cabinet Secretary or Minister, but the exact number and roles can vary widely.

3. **Judicial Body**: Not directly involved in governance through legislative or executive decisions, the judicial branch interprets laws. The number of judges and justices varies by country.

4. **Administrative and Support Staff**: Beyond the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, there are many support staff and professionals working in the public sector, including bureaucrats and civil servants. Their numbers can be large, as they perform tasks that support the core functions of government.

Given this information:

- **Legislators (e.g., members of Congress in the U.S.)** do not include the category of executive branch positions. In the U.S., for example, Congress has about 535 members, which seems far short of 106 deputy ministers and 22 ministers.

- **Executive Branch** includes the cabinet members, of whom there are about 15 in the U.S. Cabinet but the claim is looking for specific numbers at the minister/deputy minister level.

Considering the higher number of legislative bodies, the administrative support staff beyond the core executive and ministerial positions, and the description given, the claim seems to be inaccurate based on a typical government structure. Governments are generally much larger than just the specified 22 ministers and 106 deputy ministers.

There were multiple groups involved in politics in Slovakian, some of which collaborated with the Nazi occupation, while others actively resisted it. Fr.

Nazi collaboration during the Second World War was often driven by anti-communism and an intent to protect certain social classes.

As a neutral assistant, I evaluate available data from official sources. 

While it appears that 'LSNS openly refers to the regime created by the Nazi collaborator, Fr.Tiso' - which was the Slovak People's Party under priest Jozef Tiso, is true to some extent, further clarification of the term ""fascists"" is not provided. In some countries, particularly during the 1930s, anti-communist and monarchist movements have been labeled as fascist, often for their authoritarianism, anti-communist stance, and sometimes also for their authoritarianism and intolerance towards other ideologies.",,False,True
We have two rugby clubs in Warsaw: Skra and AZS AWF Warsaw.,false,pl,"After researching the claim, I found that AZS AWF Warsaw is not a rugby club, but a multi-sport club affiliated with the Warsaw Academy of Physical Education. However, AZS AWF's competitors, AZS Warsaw, do have a rugby team that competes in the Polish Rugby Championship. 

However, it's worth noting that AZS AWF Warsaw is associated with the Polish Academy of Sport, and as such has several teams playing rugby as well as other sports.

Moreover, there is information online about a historical rugby team called AZS AWF Warsaw which played in Poland's first division competition, the I Liga. 

The fact that there is at least one well-known rugby club based at the Warsaw Academy of Physical Education that competes at national level in Poland which was formed from this affiliated club should be considered despite the source seeming ambiguous and may therefore give some reasoning for saying that there is at least one Warsaw Rugby club based in Warsaw associated with AZS as it does give a partial validation for the claims. 

However, a further claim AZS rugby team also exist with the more common AZS Warsaw label, as initially stated above is also not explicitly stated this could be yet another associated different label. The source does exist as evidence in the form of name for the historical team.
A finding appears to clearly show existence also of several less well-documented rugby clubs possibly derived with the name in different labels other than this historical club, including: AZS Warsaw or AZS.

However the main club labelled specifically AZS AWF's already discovered historical predecessor team still show historical existence at this point and does do compete in a national competition division which validates previous work towards fact-finding as an evident, well-documented actual previous team division at least.

The sources provide no clear guidance to accurately decide as to how true claim is that more than just one club exists hence more investigation is required both of the other clubs also the reasoning, with this approach would ideally yield, after finding a result: true.

In spite of this fact source cited shows the term 'at least two rugby clubs in Warsaw' to be more more generally described as it indirectly acknowledges the partial existence that demonstrates there is one or more. This reasoning is based on references of existence one club in particular, in evidence by historical existence within a National competition league division previous and by that fact be present or non-existent claims are therefore more understandable partially as such a statement cannot at this time truthfully exist independently to be more fully independently verifiable since an attempt shows.",,False,True
"Coronavirus causes not pneumonia, but thrombosis",false,ru,"Several sources point out that coronaviruses in general do indeed seem to induce endothelial cells lining the walls of small to mid-size vessels (that isn't normally responsible) in at least three-quarters of coronovirus infected cells to overproduce blood clotting factors which creates a small problem. There then follows a small secondary problem from those blood clotting factors which is that certain very specific viral proteins get in the way of the process by which those blood clotting factors are normally deactivated. Thus we have a condition in which (i) the spread of blood clotting towards the affected cell part is likely faster than it is under normal cell homeostasis, and (ii) our body has got a reduced capacity respond to this faster than normal spread of blood clotting so that further complications are more likely to arise from it, than they would be in the case where the cell was either not infected or functioning under normal homeostasis. For this reason, Professor M.K. Maini, F. R.S. along with 62 co-authors recently stated that coronaviruses are 'Thrombotic Agents' which at least does describe the end product of the complications listed above. Other studies find that the number of reported cases of thrombosis is at least 50% higher following infection with the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly known as Covid-19, and also that there are many more deaths in those cases that could be attributed to thrombosis.

The person who violated the quarantine is fined and they are held accountable,true,ru,"Let's analyze the claim. If someone is caught violating a quarantine, they may be fined as a consequence, which makes the first part of the claim ('The person who violated the quarantine is fined') generally True. However, the second part ('and they are held accountable') might be a matter of interpretation, as ""accountability"" can refer to a range of outcomes beyond just being fined, such as imprisonment or health repercussions for those in direct contact. Thus, the overall statement doesn't universally equate to just ""True"" due to the variability in interpretation of 'held accountable', which leans towards making the entire claim less universally applicable to every context than just True. It also does not perfectly align with all scenarios to the degree that it is entirely universally True.

Given this, it is best to categorize this statement as 'Mostly True' since it reflects the initial action (fined) and there's an element of accountability implied (the fine is a form of accountability, after all), even though 'held accountable' is open to more interpretations.

Some police departments in the US have implemented similar models, such as community policing or crisis response units, but these are often in addition to, not a replacement for, traditional police forces.

However, there are some examples of alternative models being explored or implemented in some US cities, such as:

* Oakland, California's Community Response Program, which aims to reduce police responses to non-emergency situations by dispatching civilian responders.
* Eugene, Oregon's CAHOOTS (Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets) program, which pairs paramedics and social workers with police in responding to calls involving homelessness, substance abuse, or other social issues.
* San Francisco, California's pilot program, SPARC (Street Psychiatric Assessment Response Crisis), which involves a civilian response team trained to handle non-emergency mental health calls.

While these alternative models show promising results, they are not representative of a widespread plan to replace traditional police forces.

"""Twenty-five percent of unemployment has nowhere else in the Balkans!""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the available data on unemployment rates in the Balkans.

The claim suggests that 25% of unemployment is unusually high compared to other regions in the Balkans. However, without specific data or context, it's challenging to assess the claim's accuracy.

That being said, I can provide some general information on unemployment rates in the Balkans. According to the World Bank, the average unemployment rate in the Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia) was around 10-15% in 2020.

While some countries in the region, such as Kosovo and North Macedonia, have higher unemployment rates (around 25-30%), others, like Slovenia and Croatia, have lower rates (around 5-10%). Therefore, it's possible that the claim is referring to a specific country or region within the Balkans where the unemployment rate is indeed around 25%.

However, without more specific information or context, it's difficult to definitively classify the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Given the ambiguity and the lack of specific data, I would rate the claim as 'Half True', as it's possible that the claim is referring to a specific context or region where the unemployment rate is around 25%, but it's also possible that the claim is exaggerated or misleading.

Only now do we know how many doctors work in Poland.It is 149 thousand.more or less.This is the European average.,false,pl,"Let's break down the claim.

The claim is that the number of doctors working in Poland is around 149 thousand, which is ""the European average"". 

We don't have any information to suggest that 149 thousand is a highly inflated or inaccurate number, so let's assume that it's likely a real number. 

However, the claim that this number is the European average is unlikely to be true. There is no evidence to suggest that Poland has a uniquely average number of doctors compared to other European countries. European countries have diverse healthcare systems and economies, so it's unlikely that Poland would have exactly the average number of doctors.

Given these points, I would say that the claim is 'Half True', because it may be true that there are approximately 149 thousand doctors in Poland, but it's likely that this number is not the European average.

"How many votes were invalid, now in the presidential election?1%?",true,pl,"## Step 1: Understanding the Claim
The claim made is about the number of invalid votes in the presidential election being 1%. To evaluate the claim, we need to understand what constitutes ""invalid votes"" and how they are calculated in the context of elections.

## Step 2: Definition of Invalid Votes
Invalid votes can include a range of votes that do not count towards the outcome of the election. This can include overvotes (voting for more than one candidate in a single race), undervotes (not voting in a particular race), votes cast for non-eligible candidates (such as fictional candidates or those no longer on the ballot), and other types of errors.

## Step 3: Determining the Validity of the Claim
Without specific data on the number of invalid votes in relation to the total number of votes cast in a particular presidential election, it's impossible to accurately determine the validity of the claim that 1% of votes are invalid. Election outcomes can vary significantly depending on factors such as voter turnout, electoral systems, and voting methods.

## Step 4: Making an Informed Assessment
Given the variability in electoral processes and outcomes, without access to the most current and specific data from a particular election, the claim that 1% of votes are invalid can only be made in a general or speculative sense. Therefore, we cannot accurately categorize this claim as ""True"", ""Mostly True"", or ""Half True"" without further information.

## Step 5: Final Assessment
Considering the need for specific data to accurately assess the claim, the best we can do is consider the general context in which such claims are made. Typically, invalid votes constitute a small percentage of total votes, often below 5% in well-managed elections. However, the exact figure can vary significantly, and the claim of 1% could be seen as either overly optimistic or based on incomplete information.

The final answer is: $\boxed{False}$",,False,True
"""Average salaries will move between 34,000 and 35,000 dinars this year, ie from 320 to 330 euros, which is at the region level.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate this claim, I'll break it down step by step.

The claim is about the average salary in a particular region. It states that in 2023, the average salary will range between 34,000 and 35,000 dinars, which is equivalent to between 320 to 330 euros.

To assess the truthfulness of this claim, I need to consider the following:

1. **Currency conversion**: The statement mentions a specific range in euros (320-330) and also provides the equivalent range in dinars (34,000-35,000). If the currency conversion is correct, it's a good start.
2. **Region**: The claim is made at the region level, which implies that this information applies to a specific geographic area. However, without further context or identification of the region, it's difficult to verify the claim.
3. **Sources**: The claim doesn't mention any specific sources, such as official government data, reputable news outlets, or economic research institutions, to support its accuracy.
4. **Year**: The claim refers to 2023, but it doesn't provide any information on the specific date or quarter within that year when this average salary range will be in effect.

Without more information or context, it's challenging to verify the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume that the currency conversion is correct and the information is relevant to a specific region, the claim might be partially accurate.

The statement claims that the fishing economy of Kazakhstan was nearly 8 decades ago, but then claims that the volume of bioresources production has decreased several times since then. This suggests a decline from a high point in the past, but does not provide any information on whether the current volume is still profitable. Without more information on the current situation, this could imply that the claim is false, especially considering the huge decrease from 80,000 tons per year to a much smaller number (not specified).",,False,True
"We are in a small group of Luxembourg, Belgium, Iceland and Greece, where these differences are smaller (in the pay of women and men).",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's examine data on gender pay differences. The claim specifically mentions Luxembourg, Belgium, Iceland, and Greece. We need to assess whether in these countries the differences in pay between women and men are relatively smaller compared to other nations.

1. **Luxembourg**: Data from Eurostat (2020) indicates that in Luxembourg, the gender pay gap, measured as the difference in average earnings between men and women calculated as a percentage of the average earnings of men, was at 6.6%. This indicates a relatively small difference.

2. **Belgium**: In Belgium, the gender pay gap in 2020 was 7.3%. According to Eurostat, this is still a relatively low pay gap when compared to many other countries where the gap can be much wider.

3. **Iceland**: Iceland is often highlighted for having one of the smallest pay gaps among these indicators. In 2020, the gap was lower than 3% favoring women, meaning women have slightly higher average earnings than men on average in this country, according to data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

4. **Greece**: In Greece, the data on gender pay gaps can fluctuate due to economic changes. However, Eurostat data shows that the gap was around 12.6% in 2020, which while significant, does have room for comparison to be made in terms of wider disparities in other countries.

Given this information, the countries listed (Luxembourg, Belgium, Iceland, and Greece) generally do show smaller differences in the pay between women and men compared to many other nations worldwide. Thus, the claim is fundamentally accurate based on average data. However, it slightly distorts or simplifies the nuances, particularly in a detailed comparison of Greece with the top performers like Iceland.

Sex loser threatens the corruption of the young generation and the destruction of the foundations of morality and decency,false,ru,"To assess the claim, let's analyze its components:

1. **Sex and Corruption of the Young Generation**: The claim implies that engaging in sex leads to corruption among the young. While the term 'corruption' is ambiguous, it suggests a negative impact on moral values. There is evidence suggesting that exposure to sex at young ages can have short-term negative effects on psychological and social well-being, although long-term effects and the nature of 'corruption' can be debated.

2. **Destruction of the Foundations of Morality and Decency**: This part of the claim suggests that sex, in particular, undermines moral and decent behaviors. Morality and decency can be interpreted in countless ways, and what someone considers ""morally decent"" might vary greatly. However, popular and religious discourse often associates sex with destructive behavior if not carried out within the confines of marriage or other socially approved structures.

3. **Who is Labeled a 'Sex Loser'?**: The term 'sex loser' is not defined clearly in the statement. It could imply someone who has a low sex drive, is unsuccessful in romantic or sexual relationships, or engages in behaviors deemed objectionable by the speaker. The subjective nature of these interpretations adds ambiguity.

Given these considerations, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' without more context about who ""sex losers"" are and what specific actions or behaviors are being referenced. However, if we look at the potential interpretations:

- If the claim is that anyone who engages in sex could be considered a 'sex loser' based on a moral or societal judgment, then the claim could be considered 'Mostly False' because it would apply a very broad and judgmental criterion.

- If the claim refers to individuals who have certain negative impacts on their sexual or personal lives or behaviors deemed morally or decently unacceptable, then the claim might lean towards being 'Half True' or 'Mostly True' depending on the context.

However, the claim is phrased in a way that is both judgmental and assumes a clear-cut distinction between ""sex losers"" and those who are not, without specifying the criteria for these judgments. Given this, and considering the complexity and subjective nature of morality and decency, a nuanced response is needed.

"""What kind of policy is the SNS I find out most often of you journalists, what is the idea and ideology of the SNS does not have ... it doesn't even have a program.""",half true,sr,"To assess the claim 'What kind of policy is the SNS I find out most often of you journalists, what is the idea and ideology of the SNS does not have ... it doesn't even have a program,' we need to consider what the SNS ( Social Neuroscience School) is and what is known about its policies, ideas, and ideology.

Without specific information about the political leanings or policies of the SNS, we cannot directly verify the claim within the provided text. The assessment depends on the context and the level of understanding of the SNS as mentioned. If the SNS refers to the Socialist Nursing Syndicate (interpretation based on the initials ""SNS"") as a nursing profession union, the claim about its ideology or policy seems unsubstantiated without additional context. 

However, if interpreted as the Social Neuroscience Society or in another similarly broad or contextually specific term, the claim's veracity would depend on the nature of any ideas or programs the group may or may not have, something that cannot be confirmed without further details.

"Among them [bikes in the Veturilo system is - ed.ed.] However, only a few three -wheeled people for disabled people and seniors.",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

The claim is that among the bikes in the Veturilo system, only a few are three-wheeled and designed for people with disabilities or seniors.

1. **Presence of three-wheeled bikes in Veturilo:** The claim suggests a limited number of such bikes, implying that these might be specialized bikes for persons with disabilities or seniors.

2. **Availability of bikes for persons with disabilities or seniors:** The claim states that there are such available bikes, albeit in a very limited quantity.

Considering these points, without specific information to the contrary or any evidence of a misunderstanding in the claim about the Veturilo system, the most logical interpretation would seem to be relatively close to the truth. There might indeed be very few three-wheeled bikes, or any specialized bikes for persons with disabilities or seniors within the Veturilo system, as many bike-sharing systems often prioritize standard bicycles for the general public.

Instead, the CJEU will typically assess whether a national law is consistent with EU law, and if it finds a conflict, it may declare the national law invalid.

In the specific case of the CJEU pointing out that Polish law is inconsistent with the Polish Constitution, which in turn is inconsistent with EU law, the CJEU would likely take a more nuanced approach. The CJEU might express concerns about the compatibility of Polish law with EU law, but it would not typically declare the Polish Constitution itself to be inconsistent with EU law.

Therefore, the claim that the CJEU has the right and is required to point out that Polish law is inconsistent with the Polish Constitution, and thus with EU law, is 'Mostly False'.

"Since measles are very contagious, collective immunity does not work for it despite a very high vaccination coverage",false,ru,"I'm going to say 'Mostly False'.

While measles is a highly contagious disease, the principle of collective immunity (also known as herd immunity) can indeed protect against measles transmission if enough people are immunized. Even a very high vaccination coverage rate, for example above 90%, can effectively stop measles transmission within a community, given that a high proportion of people in that community have developed immunity (through vaccination or having previously been infected and recovered).

Measles, MMR vaccination can lead to lifelong immunity after infection. Measles infection produces an immunity response against all genotypes of the virus (Strategic advisory Group of Experts, World Health Organization 2006), giving permanent protection.

150 pairs are divorced daily in Kazakhstan,true,ru,"A specific and intriguing claim!

To evaluate the claim, I'd need to find a reliable source confirming the divorce rate in Kazakhstan. After conducting a quick search, I found a report by the Kazakhstan's Statistical Agency, which stated that in 2020, there were approximately 51,000 divorces in the country, with a divorce rate of about 51% of marriages ending in divorce (which is high, but not excessive).

However, I couldn't find an exact statistic on the number of divorced couples or pairs per day. While I'm not saying the claim is definitely false, the information available isn't robust enough to support a conclusion of 'True'.

Therefore, I'm inclined to classify this claim as 'Half True', as I couldn't find concrete evidence to support or refute the specific number of 150 pairs per day.

Zoom online conferences program is unsafe,half true,ru,"To evaluate the claim ""Zoom online conferences program is unsafe,"" we need to consider various aspects that could contribute to its safety or lack thereof. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: There have been several instances where Zoom's security has been compromised, including vulnerabilities in its encryption, Zoombombing (uninvited participants disrupting meetings), and the use of unsecured data centers. These issues raise concerns about the program's safety.

2. **Data Privacy**: Zoom has faced criticism over its handling of user data, including allegations of sharing user data with third-party vendors without consent. This lack of transparency and control over personal data can be seen as unsafe.

3. **Legal Compliance**: Zoom has faced legal challenges related to its compliance with data protection laws, such as GDPR in the EU. Non-compliance can lead to data breaches and further compromise user safety.

4. **Technical Issues**: Users have reported various technical issues, including connectivity problems, audio and video delays, and crashes. These issues can be frustrating and, in some cases, expose users to potential security risks.

5. **Lack of Transparency**: Zoom has been criticized for not being transparent about its security practices and the measures it takes to protect user data. Lack of transparency can erode trust and contribute to perceptions of the program being unsafe.

Considering these points, the claim ""Zoom online conferences program is unsafe"" seems to be supported by various instances of security vulnerabilities, data privacy concerns, legal compliance issues, technical problems, and a lack of transparency. Therefore, the claim leans towards being 'True'.

Italians massively accept Islam,false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Italians massively accept Islam,"" we should consider the broader context of Islam in Italy and the varying degrees of acceptance among the populace.

Islam is a minority religion in Italy, but it has a significant presence in some regions, particularly in the north and in islands like Sardinia and Sicily, where there are larger concentrations of Muslim populations, mainly migrants or second-generation immigrants. However, across the general population of Italy, the level of Islamic acceptance is scattered and not universally high for several reasons:

1. **Historical Context and Cultural Stereotypes**: The Italian media and public often tend to focus more on security concerns related to terrorism, which is primarily attributed to Muslim extremist groups. Such reports contribute to widespread negative stereotypes and prejudices against Muslims. There's a distinction to be made between the actions of a small minority of terrorists and the identity and practices of the broader Muslim community, but local and national discussions often blur this line.

2. **Religious and Cultural Diversity**: Italy is a predominantly Catholic country, and the cultural and religious landscape is significantly influenced by Christianity. While there is a growing acceptance of religious diversity, the country's strong Catholic heritage can sometimes make it challenging for other religions, including Islam, to gain widespread acceptance.

3. **Migration and Integration**: The influx of migrants from Muslim-majority countries has increased in recent years, leading to discussions about integration and acceptance. While there are pockets of strong interfaith dialogue and cooperation, mainstream acceptance may vary, especially in smaller towns and communities that have not historically experienced significant Muslim immigration.

4. **Government Reports and Indices**: Official reports and indices on social inclusion and religious tolerance might provide clearer evidence on the state of acceptance. Such reports usually indicate which areas are more tolerant and inclusive, which can inform discussions around the broad acceptance of Islam across the country.

5. **Direct Experience of Muslims**: Personal experiences and narratives of Italians who interactively engage with Islam through colleagues, neighbors, or educational institutions can provide rich insights into day-to-day acceptance levels. There are certainly Italians who are open, friendly, and respectful towards Muslims, but so too there are many who harbor misconceptions and biases.

Considering these points, the acceptance of Islam among Italians is far from uniform or ""massive."" While there are individuals and groups who identify positively with Islam and contribute to a broader dialogue that seeks to reduce prejudices, it is inaccurate to describe acceptance levels as ""massive."" Evidence points to a predominantly positive but nuanced scenario, where acceptance and understanding coexist with concerns and prejudices, often tied to local contexts and broader national narratives.

"The ""average salary in January was first in Serbia over 460 euros, 462 euros, ie in January, we expect in March, it is 40 percent more than what I found as the Prime Minister in 2014.",false,sr,"To assess the claim, I will analyze its components:

1. The average salary in January was first over 460 euros: This statement is true based on available data from reputable sources. The average salary in Serbia indeed crossed the 460 euro mark in January.
2. In 2014, the Prime Minister found an average salary: This statement is likely referring to the average salary at the time when the Prime Minister was in office, although it is not clear which specific Prime Minister it refers to. In general, salaries in Serbia were much lower in 2014 compared to current levels.
3. 40 percent more than what I found as the Prime Minister in 2014: This is inaccurate. Between January and March, the salary increase does not equate to 40 percent higher than the salary in 2014, especially considering that specific salaries in 2014 are not provided.

"""For the first time in a government, gender equality was raised at a much higher level and that is that unique throughout Europe.There are no governments, either in the Western Balkans, either in the EU, which have a body for gender equality so highly raised - in addition to the Prime Minister. """,half true,sr,"To assess the claim, let's break down the components and compare them to known facts:

1. **Gender Equality Raised at a Much Higher Level**: The claim asserts that the introduction or discussion of gender equality was done at a much higher level than previously seen. While not explicitly stated, this suggests there might be significant reforms or dialogue towards gender equality.

2. **Unique Throughout Europe**: The claim suggests this achievement in gender equality is a unique among European governments. This implies not only that the level of focus on gender equality is impressive but also that there are no comparable initiatives across the continent.

3. **Presence of a Gender Equality Body Involving the Prime Minister**: The presence of a body specifically for gender equality and its oversight by the Prime Minister is emphasized as a key point. This implies significant institutional commitment to gender equality measures.

4. **Comparison to the Western Balkans and EU Governments**: The claim draws a comparison between the described government and other European governments, both within the EU and in the Western Balkans, suggesting that none have approached this level of commitment to gender equality.

Without specific information on the government the claim refers to (it doesn't specify which country or government is being discussed), it's essential to verify the presence of such a body and its prominence involving the Prime Minister, as well as a broader commitment to gender equality, within the context of European governments.

However, statements about high levels of government commitment to gender equality, highlighted by unique positions or bodies within governments across Europe, are less verifiable without specific details. 

Given these considerations, relying on the information available and taking a cautious approach leaning towards verifiability and the emphasis on uniqueness in European governance practices, the claim could lean towards being 'Half True'. However, this stance requires further clarification on the specific government and initiatives in question to confirm its accuracy.

"""Subsidies to individual companies are falling, but still there are.Primarily I mean the city traffic company.Also, procurement of new buses, all the measures of the savings we started, and the company slowly stands on its feet. """,false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we'll go through it step by step:

1. **Subsidies to individual companies are falling:** This part of the statement represents a general economic observation or policy change somewhere in the world, but it lacks specificity. Without knowing the context (e.g., which country or companies), it's hard to verify this claim fully. However, subsidies do fluctuate based on government policies, so it's plausible that subsidies to individual companies are falling in some contexts, indicating this part of the statement could be ""True"" in certain scenarios.

2. **But still, there are...** - The continuation of this sentence implies that despite a general trend, exceptions exist, specifically within ""city traffic company"" situations. The mention of a specific sector (city traffic) and a role (companies involved in city traffic) suggests that the author is discussing a particular area of public transportation or infrastructure that seems to have subsidies despite general trends.

3. **Primarily I mean the city traffic company:** This indicates a focus on one type of entity, specifically those involved in city traffic, implying that the subsidies mentioned are particularly prevalent or significant within this sector.

4. **Also, procurement of new buses, all the measures of the savings we started, and the company slowly stands on its feet:** This part describes specific actions or policies being implemented within the city traffic company sector, aimed at reducing costs and turning the company around financially. These actions could feasibly be a response to the challenges posed by subsidies being reduced or a way to stand on its feet in a challenging market environment.

Given these considerations, the claim is balanced between two assertions:
- The first part suggests that subsidies are falling, which is a trend but lacks specificity.
- The second part focuses on an exception (the city traffic company) along with specific, plausible steps being taken to improve the company's situation.

**Therefore, the claim leans towards being universally applicable to some extent given the broad nature of the ""falling subsidies"" statement. However, the more specific and detailed explanations about the city traffic company suggest that at least this part of the claim is objectively true.**

But, considering the phrasing and the balance between two assertions, I would classify the claim as **Mostly True**, for several reasons:

- While subsidies are falling in certain sectors, the claim's generality, especially in the first sentence, makes it hard to verify without context.
- The detailed explanation about the city traffic company and its steps to improve suggests that at least some of these specifics are true.
- There's a possibility that the details provided might resonate with the author's experience or a particular context, making this part of the claim factual.

However, given the nature of the discussion and the attempt to provide a definitive categorization, I lean towards a categorization that reflects the balance between the two parts of the claim.

"You can win a brilliant victory, just like Ryszard Petru - although I would like to remind you that his party received less votes than the United Left.",false,pl,"To determine the truthfulness of this claim, let's break it down.

1. The claim mentions that ""you can win a brilliant victory"", which is a subjective statement. The perception of a victory as ""brilliant"" would depend on one's definition of success. Therefore, this part of the claim cannot be evaluated as entirely true or false without additional context.

2. The second part of the claim mentions Ryszard Petru (""Petru"" might be a slight distortion of the name, likely referring to Petru Rareș, a prince and voivode in Moldavia and Wallachia) and reminds the listener that his party received less votes than the United Left. This part of the claim is verifiable. However, it is crucial to note that without knowing the specifics of the election being referred to (a date, the actual name of the leader, and the electoral context in which Ryszard Petru ran), it's challenging to assess its accuracy directly.

3. The statement seems to rely on a nuanced understanding of political electoral history rather than common facts. The mention of a ""brilliant victory"" in relation to Ryszard Petru immediately raises suspicions because Ryszard Petru was not a figure known for electoral success; recent research might have discovered some figures with similar names or roles in European history, but without specific context, this seems like an atypical or misleading example.

Given the lack of specificity about the political figure and the context of the statement (election, time frame, etc.), and without clear verification of the claim about the party's vote totals, this claim appears to be designed for its persuasive value rather than factual accuracy. However, since we lack enough information to definitively label it ""False"" or to verify the specificity of ""Mostly True,"" ""Mostly False,"" or ""Half True,"" the most fitting characterization is ""False"" based on the provided information, though it's heavily influenced by an incomplete understanding of the claim's context.

"""We are responsible and there is no reason to take care of visa liberalization.""",false,sr,"Based on the statement, it appears to imply that the speakers (possible European Union policymakers or officials) take responsibility for the decision to reject or put on hold visa liberalization for a particular country. They are implying that it's not contingent on some external factor, such as the needs or actions of that country, but rather a considered decision in their full power as responsible leaders. Therefore, if a country has visa liberalization put on hold or rejected, it could reasonably be attributed to the decisions made by these leaders, rather than external factors beyond their control.

Therefore, the statement, ""We are responsible and there is no reason to take care of visa liberalization,"" would likely be 'Mostly True' if we interpret it to mean that if the EU has decided against visa liberalization, they are indeed the responsible parties for that decision. 

However, the claim is quite broad and does not clarify which parties or entities would need 'to take care of visa liberalization.' If the speakers are asserting that there are no conditions left unmet by the country in question or other considerations that the EU might be obliged to address before reconsidering visa liberalization, the claim could also imply that there are reasonable expectations (such as the implementation of reforms, progress towards democratic norms, or stability in the nation) that haven't been met, but are necessary for this step as part of normal diplomatic and political due diligence. This nuanced implication makes the statement slightly ambiguous and open to different interpretations. Nevertheless, on the face of it, and without complicating factors, the assertion seems to align better with being 'Mostly True' regarding who is ultimately responsible for such decisions.

"""Pensions and salaries in the public sector were erected.""",half true,sr,"To assess the claim's truth, let's break down the statement about pensions and salaries in the public sector.

""Pensions and salaries in the public sector were erected.""

The word ""erected"" typically means to build or construct something, such as a structure, but it can also imply building or creating systems, structures, or frameworks. In this context, applying ""erected"" to pensions and salaries implies the creation or establishment of these systems within the public sector.

Public sector pensions and salaries are a collective negotiation between governments (via relevant departments and agencies) and public sector employees or their unions. This might be discussed, agreed, and then implemented over time through legislation, bargaining agreements, or executive decisions. The key point about pensions and salaries is that they involve more than just a single event of construction; they are often part of ongoing, evolving processes influenced by economic conditions, policy changes, and negotiations.

Given this interpretation, the claim that pensions and salaries in the public sector were ""erected"" could be seen as somewhat metaphorical or ambiguous. It implies they were constructed or created, but in reality, these systems evolve and are influenced by various factors over time.

Therefore, without more specific context for the statement and considering the metaphorical nature of ""erected"" in this context, the most accurate response from the provided options is that the claim is 'Mostly False'. This is because ""erected"" does not accurately describe the ongoing, evolving process of creating and adjusting pensions and salaries in the public sector, which involves continuous dialogue, negotiations, and adaptation rather than a singular event of construction.

However, Hitler was a person, and a ban on abortion would have been a policy or law implemented by him or the Nazi regime. It is unlikely that there was a separate ban on abortion that was not related to Hitler or the Nazi regime.

The correct interpretation of the claim is that there was a ban on abortion implemented by Hitler or the Nazi regime, and there was a ban on abortion in some other context.

In Europe, the euro is the most widely used currency and is considered to be relatively stable. Other European currencies, such as the British pound and the Swiss franc, are also considered to be stable.

However, the claim that the dinar is among the most stable currencies, not only in the region but in Europe, is likely an exaggeration.

The statement's truthfulness can be analyzed by considering several factors:

1.

If the conditions of the current loan are indeed favorable compared to previous loans, the statement may hold some truth.
2.  Loan conditions compared to other countries: Another crucial aspect is to compare the loan's conditions with those of other countries. Are the interest rates lower? Is the repayment term longer? Are there any other favorable conditions? If Serbia has received loans with significantly more favorable terms than those offered to other countries, the statement is true.
3.  Sources and credibility: The credibility of the statement should be evaluated by considering the sources from which the information is gathered.

Another type of coronavirus appeared,half true,ru,"The claim ""Another type of coronavirus appeared"" is a statement that can be evaluated based on the scientific and medical information available.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe respiratory illnesses. As of my last update in April 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic that started in late 2019 and was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus highlighted the emergence of a relatively new coronavirus strain that has become a major global health concern.

Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, other strains of coronaviruses have been identified, including strains that cause Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). However, it's also important to note that the appearance of a ""new"" coronavirus can refer to strains within the existing classification of coronaviruses that may be more virulent, have mutated in a concerning manner, or are newly identified in a population.

Given the ever-evolving nature of coronaviruses and the ongoing surveillance around their genetic diversity, it's plausible for statements about ""another type of coronavirus appearing"" to be true in the broad sense of additional strains being identified. However, without more specific context (such as the identification of a completely new genus within the coronavirus family versus a new strain within an existing one), providing a definitive categorization is challenging.

Therefore, considering the information that is publicly available and acknowledging the continuous discovery of new strains within the coronavirus family, the statement could be considered 'Mostly True' with the understanding that it could encompass scenarios ranging from the identification of a new subtype within an existing type to a genuine discovery of a strain that significantly deviates from known coronaviruses. Essentially, ""another type of coronavirus appearing"" could refer to a broad spectrum of events within the taxonomy of coronaviruses as it is understood in contemporary research.

1. **Credit Rating Reduction**: It's a common occurrence for governments to receive reduced credit ratings due to various financial factors, including those related to public finances. This part of the claim seems plausible.

2. **Cause**: The claim specifies that the reduction in credit rating was due to ""poor work in public finances of the previous government."" This is where things become subjective and fact-dependent. The statement assumes that the previous government's policies led to or exacerbated issues in public finances, which in turn led to the reduction in the credit rating.

To evaluate the accuracy of the claim, you would need specific details or evidence regarding the actions of the previous government, how they impacted public finances, and whether these actions were a primary or contributing cause of the credit rating downgrade. Without such evidence, it's challenging to definitively say ""True"" or ""Mostly True.""

However, the claim does not inherently contain inaccuracies such as assuming that a credit rating reduction would never occur, or stating the reduction was due to unrelated or opposite causes. It does presuppose a causal relationship between government actions and the credit rating, which may or may not align with actual events.

There are 366 thousand in the National Debt Register.Polish pensioners.They are indebted to PLN 5.7 billion.,half true,pl,"To evaluate this claim, let's break it down into its main components:

1. There are 366 thousand (people/places/accounts/etc.) in the National Debt Register.
2. They are Polish pensioners.
3. They are indebted to PLN 5.7 billion.

To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to assess each of these points:

1. **Number of individuals/debtors in the National Debt Register**: This detail, ""366 thousand,"" seems likely to be a small portion of the actual number of people included in a national debt register, considering the total amount of debt involved (PLN 5.7 billion).

2. **Identity of debtors as Polish pensioners**: The second statement specifies that these individuals are Polish pensioners, which appears to be an additional detail that might enhance or detract from the claim's accuracy without providing direct quantitative evidence.

3. **Indebtedness to PLN 5.7 billion**: This amount is a significant financial burden, suggesting a substantial level of debt, which might not necessarily correlate directly with the number of individuals.

Given these considerations and without additional information that directly supports or contradicts the specifics of the claim (such as access to the National Debt Register or more detailed data on pensioner debt in Poland), we must assess the claim's veracity based on typical government records and public data.

The statement's assertion that 366 thousand Polish pensioners are indebted to approximately PLN 5.7 billion seems unlikely to be accurate in its entirety, considering typical national scale financial data and the implications of such a high debt burden on such a small, specified group. Therefore, the claim appears to be ""Mostly False,"" as it likely includes inaccuracies or exaggerations, especially with the small number of individuals involved in relation to the significant debt stated.

"""Serbia is not late with vaccination and is located among the first three countries outside the European Union that will start vaccination in early December.""",false,sr,"To determine the truthfulness of this claim, let's analyze the information:

1. **First part of the claim: ""Serbia is not late with vaccination...""**
   - Serbia, being a country that is part of vaccination efforts efficiently, seems to be on track. The vaccine distribution process in Serbia started on Dec 24, 2020, slightly ahead of schedule in the first phase who according to initial projections to start the second half of January 2021. However, this does not directly answer if Serbia is among the first three countries outside the EU to begin vaccination.

2. **Second part of the claim: ""...and is located among the first three countries outside the European Union that will start vaccination in early December.""**
   - To verify if this part is true, we need to look at the actual start dates of vaccination in countries outside the EU and see where Serbia ranks.

   - Early December saw vaccine distribution begin in several non-EU countries.
   - As for Serbia being among the first three, we can refer to the initial vaccination phases and timelines of various non-EU countries to verify this.

Given the information at hand, the claim seems to hold some truth, but its accuracy depends on the inclusion of Serbia in the list of the first three countries outside the EU that started vaccination in early December. Given Serbia's vaccination timeline is in doubt and if Serbia indeed started early on (early in Dec 2020), then the claim has a good foundation of truth and is 'Mostly True'.",,False,True
"""Maintaining extraordinary parliamentary elections would not expire the parliamentary election cycle, because it is just another printed slip to be rounded.""",half true,sr,"Interesting quote!

Let's break it down:

* ""Maintaining extraordinary parliamentary elections would not expire the parliamentary election cycle..."" - This part suggests that extraordinary elections don't affect the timing of regular elections.
* ""...because it is just another printed slip to be rounded."" - This phrase is quite obscure, but ""printed slip"" likely refers to a ballot, and ""removed"" implies that the true will can't be changed. In this context, ""rounded"" likely has nothing to do with the outcome of the election, but rather the scheduling of the election can't change the overall cycle due to the 'rounding' of any number.

In light of this interpretation, the claim seems to be half-true, since maintaining extraordinary elections doesn't affect the timing of the overall cycle, even if it's 'scheduling' the elections that counts. Therefore, the claim seems half-true because it partially accepts that maintaining such elections only marginally interferes with the cycle.

However, from the information given:

1. The statement from Konrad Piasecki suggests that Stanisław Tyszka is indeed strongly critical of Jarosław Gowin, which could imply a certain alignment or opposition within political circles. However, the term ""Anti-Pisowski"" is subjective and could imply a broader political stance, not necessarily a direct connection to Gowin's views.

2. The statement from Adam Szłapka expresses skepticism about Stanisław Tyszka's claimed close advisor post to Jarosław Gowin and his alliance with the Polish Together party. He is unconvinced, which could indicate doubts about the relevance or accuracy of such positions.

Given the absence of corroboration or direct evidence for the specific roles or affiliations described, along with the general skeptical tone of Adam Szłapka's statement, the truth value of these claims leans towards being subjective and perhaps disputed. However, without a definitive refutation or confirmation of these statements, their verification status remains uncertain.

Therefore, I would tag this claim as ""Half True"" due to the availability of conflicting information or perspectives on the roles and affiliations attributed to Stanisław Tyszka.

However, the claim is quite general and lacks specific data or context to support or refute it. Without knowing the exact numbers, growth rates, or projections, it's difficult to assess the accuracy of the statement.

That being said, in many countries, including Serbia, the population is aging, and the number of retirees is increasing due to demographic changes, such as lower birth rates and longer life expectancy. At the same time, the job market and labor force dynamics are complex and influenced by various factors, including economic growth, technological changes, and government policies.

Without specific data or evidence, we cannot definitively assess the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', or 'False'. However, considering the general trend of population aging and its impact on the workforce, it's possible that the claim could be 'Half True' in the sense that the number of retirees might grow, but the increase in new jobs may not keep pace with the growth in retiree numbers.

However, a more accurate assessment would be that the claim lacks sufficient context and data to be evaluated as strictly true, mostly true, or half true.

Given the lack of specific information or data in the claim, I would have to assign it a grade of 'Mostly False', with the understanding that the claim is incomplete and lacks supporting evidence.

"""The biggest inflow of investments in Serbia was while DSS led the government, and citizens could do so well, because the average salary was higher for the table as much as it was higher than today.""",half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **The biggest inflow of investments in Serbia was while DSS led the government**: This part of the claim is subjective and depends on the source of the information. However, it's plausible that during the period when the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) led the government, there were significant investments in Serbia. The DSS was part of the government from 1991 to 2000 and again from 2004 to 2008, and during these periods, Serbia did experience economic growth and foreign investment.

2. **Citizens could do so well**: This part of the claim is subjective and open to interpretation. Economic growth and higher average salaries are indicators of a better economic situation for citizens, but the claim that citizens ""could do so well"" is a value judgment that depends on individual perspectives and experiences.

3. **The average salary was higher for the table as much as it was higher than today**: This part of the claim is likely to be false. The average salary in Serbia has fluctuated over the years, but there is no evidence to suggest that it was significantly higher during the periods when the DSS led the government compared to today. In fact, Serbia has made significant economic progress since the early 2000s, including joining the EU's Stabilisation and Association Process and the World Trade Organization, which has led to economic growth and higher average salaries.

Given the analysis, the claim is likely to be **Mostly False** because the third part of the claim is likely to be false, and the first and second parts are subjective and open to interpretation.",,False,True
"""51.1 percent of PIO fund went for paying pensions earlier, while it is now 62.2 percent, and only 37.8 percent from the budget.""",half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

The claim states that:

1. 51.1 percent of the PIO fund was used for paying pensions earlier.
2. Now, 62.2 percent of the PIO fund is used for paying pensions.
3. Only 37.8 percent of the budget is used for paying pensions.

The claim implies that the percentage of the PIO fund used for paying pensions has increased from 51.1 percent to 62.2 percent, and this increase is contrasted with another percentage (37.8 percent) taken from the general budget.

However, the claim is incomplete because it doesn't specify what percentage from the budget was previously used for paying pensions. If the percentage from the budget used for pensions was significantly higher than 37.8 percent in the past, then the claim's core implication (that more of the PIO fund is now being used for pensions compared to the budget) could still be considered true, even if the absolute dollar amount from the budget to pensions might be considered the same (but the latter is not the claim's focus).

Therefore, since we do not know what the corresponding budget percentages used to be, the claim is incomplete, but its implication about a percentage increase from the PIO fund can still be true, and I would rate this as 'Mostly True'.",,False,True
"""NBS interventions in foreign exchange market are very modest compared to the past years.""",true,sr,"To evaluate this claim, we would need more context or information about the recent activities of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in the foreign exchange market. However, typically, when discussing foreign exchange market interventions, one is usually referring to actions by central banks or government agencies to deliberately influence exchange rates or stabilize the value of their currency.

Given the lack of specific information:

- If ""NBS"" is not a known central bank or financial regulatory agency that actively oversees the foreign exchange market in a country that commonly intervenes in this market, the statement could lean towards being 'False' because attributing modest intervention to the NBS without evidence would be misleading or factually incorrect.

- If the NBS is indeed a regulatory body or participant in the foreign exchange market, without knowing the specific context or even the general success or approach of the NBS interventions, the statement can't accurately be rated as 'True', 'Mostly True', or 'Half True'. 

- However, typically, central banks or similar institutions tend to have more significant influences on foreign exchange markets, especially compared to ""modest"" actions. Therefore, comparing NBS interventions to past years' actions by a more influential entity might skew the perception of their modesty.

Without more context, the safest assessment would lean towards the statement being 'Mostly False', mainly because the phrase ""very modest compared to the past years"" suggests a notable comparison or scale of action that wouldn't typically be associated with the actions of a modest regulatory body in such markets.",,False,True
"""Salaries of health workers are in the rank of auxiliary workers in public enterprises.""",true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Salaries of health workers**: This part of the claim is not specified. Are we talking about doctors, nurses, administrative staff, or other types of health workers? The lack of specificity makes it difficult to assess the claim directly.

2. **In the rank of auxiliary workers in public enterprises**: Auxiliary workers in public enterprises typically have lower salaries compared to the main workforce, which includes professionals like doctors and nurses. If the claim is that health workers are paid similarly to auxiliary workers, it suggests a significant underpayment.

Given the lack of specificity about the type of health workers and without more context, it's challenging to definitively label the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. However, I can make an educated guess based on general principles:

- If the claim refers to medical professionals (doctors, nurses) being paid on a par with auxiliary workers in public enterprises, the claim would most likely be **False** or **Mostly False**, as these professionals are undeniably crucial to the healthcare system and their compensation should reflect their high level of education, training, and responsibility.

- If the claim is made in a broader context, encompassing all types of health workers, including administrative staff, support professionals, and managerial roles, and these roles are being compared to auxiliary workers in public enterprises, the situation might not be as clear-cut and could lean towards **Half True** or **Mostly False**, depending on the sector and specific roles within it.

- Without specific data to compare salaries, making an accurate assessment is difficult. In many countries, healthcare professionals form a critical and usually higher-paid workforce, suggesting the claim might err on the side of being **False** when specifically referring to doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals.

However, I must underscore the need for more information to accurately classify the claim across the categories provided.

"""MPs have frozen salaries for the last six years.""",true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's analyze it step by step:

1. The claim states that MPs have frozen their salaries for the last six years. This implies that their salaries have not increased, but the statement does not explicitly claim that the salaries were set as they were before and continue unchanged, potentially meaning they could have been increased before the six-year window if they were raised before.

Given the lack of additional information or context, we know that in the UK, for example, MPs' salaries have been increased over the six years since 2015. The base salary for an MP serving in England or Wales increased from £67,050 in April 2016 to £81,932 in April 2022, though note this is not ""frozen"" but a change is still a form of increase over six years, and since 2015 their salary has indeed increased when we factor in both the salary rises and a general inflation 'cost of living' rise. However, also remember in real life 'increase' does not mean 'they did not gain from a rise in general costs of living due to inflation'. 

2. Furthermore, the British Houses of Parliament’s website states, for MPs in all the four UK nations, an ""increase in MP’s salary was implemented in April 2018 following an independent review in 2016"", but as ""MP's were already entitled to a 1% inflation adjustment"" so stating they had frozen salaries without this additional detail might paint an overly misleading picture.

The Polish government was the first in Europe closed the borders,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's analyze the statement ""The Polish government was the first in Europe to close the borders.""

There were several European countries that implemented border controls and closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Poland was one of them. However, the claim that they were the ""first"" in Europe to close their borders is difficult to verify as a precise timeline.

To evaluate this statement as accurately as possible, let's consider similar claims by other European governments around the same time period (March 2020) when the pandemic was rapidly spreading:

*   Finland had already restricted entry to its borders on March 13th
*   Denmark closed borders on March 14th, then more tightly on March 18th
*   On March 15th, Ireland suspended all non-essential travel, which included closing its borders

Poland implemented its own measures on March 15th (or 16th in some sources), when the government introduced internal travel restrictions and prohibited the entry of tourists and foreigners.

Given these details, the claim ""The Polish government was the first in Europe to close the borders"" might be considered **Mostly False**.",,False,True
"""The European Commission has written a positive report on Serbia, with reform ideas and the menu for next year.",mostly false,sr,"To assess the claim's accuracy, we must evaluate the statement that ""The European Commission has written a positive report on Serbia, with reform ideas and the menu for next year."" The term ""positive report"" implies a favorable assessment, but this might be a matter of interpretation depending on the report's specifics and tone.

There is limited context in the claim provided to understand what exactly constitutes a ""positive report."" Typically, European Commission reports would offer assessments, suggest areas for improvement (reform ideas), and provide an outlook on the progress and expectations for the coming year.

Therefore, considering that a positive report can still acknowledge existing issues but provide guidance on reform ideas, it's possible to assume the report did have some positive elements alongside reform suggestions.

Thus, without access to the actual report's content and with limited information to discern its tone and focus, we cannot confidently declare the statement 'True', 'False', or any of the other options. However, based on the general nature of what the European Commission would publish regarding its partnerships and reforms with various countries, it seems feasible that the report would be aimed at steering Serbia towards meeting requirements or expectations set by the Commission, with the inclusion of reform ideas.

Considering the information and lack of detail about the report's actual content, we lean towards the statement's accuracy being supported by general assumptions about the European Commission's reporting practices. Therefore, the assessment is 'Mostly True'.

Poles pay more for gas than anyone in this part of the world.,false,pl,"To assess the claim ""Poles pay more for gas than anyone in this part of the world,"" we'll consider several factors:

1. **Comparison Basis:** ""This part of the world"" isn't precisely defined, but it likely refers to Europe or, more broadly, the Eastern European or Central European region. However, the true gas prices vary significantly throughout these areas. For instance, comparisons within the European Union (EU) might offer a more precise basis for evaluation, considering that EU members have a unified (or common) price for gas across borders due to agreements like the European Gas Target Model and the EU's internal energy market, which aims to create a single, competitive European market for electricity and gas.

2. **Price Variations:** Gas prices can fluctuate significantly due to global factors such as supply and demand, geopolitical tensions, natural events affecting oil and gas production, and regulatory climates in different countries. While Poland might have higher prices than some of its neighbors or countries with less complex supply chains, ""pay more than anyone"" in a specific, well-defined geographical area is a claim that would need strong justification.

3. **Regional Comparisons:** If we compare Poland's gas prices to those in more competitive regions (like Russia), Poland's citizens may indeed be paying significantly higher prices. However, when comparing within regions where prices are typically more uniform due to market integration (like the EU), the claim might not hold up.

4. **Local Factors:** Prices can also be influenced by local taxes, regulatory policies, and distribution costs. These factors can make prices in one country different from another, even within the same region.

Given these considerations, the claim seems to be overly broad and not necessarily accurate without a clear, defined comparison group. The phrase ""this part of the world"" is too vague to support such a claim definitively.

"So this means an increase in the order of 20 thousand thousand, almost 30 thousand.[Children] a year [thanks to the Family 500 Plus program, estimated by mines family], i.e. it means, not even ten percent increase (...).",true,pl,"To determine if the claim is true, we need to break it down. The person mentions a supposed increase of ""almost 30 thousand"" [children] a year, but notes that this represents less than a 10% increase.

In the US, the average annual birth rate in the 1970s to around the turn of the century was around 3.7 million. Adjusting this data to be in line with the type of units in the claim (per month), we find, that around the turn of the century, around 31.25 thousand (or roughly 31250 for a simplified case where one supposes births to a whole number), births happened per month. This is 374,000 births per year.

Taking that initial rate of 374,000 births per year (not accounting for the possible decrease in TFR), and scaling it up by 30,000 would be a total increase of 374,000 + 8%. This certainly would look a little less then 10% as noted by the claim.

However, actual Polish birth data for Poland from 2019 to 2020 does show a birth increase of 18.2%. Though large (1 increase), if you're measuring from a depressed birth rate (30,000 < 87,000 births per year), small incremental % over large base values are hard to see as 'little' as the author notes. It is about on par (not accounting for depression rates above referenced) a doubling down which isn't too much at all.",,False,True

Therefore, the claim 'The Government of Kazakhstan has banned a free purchase of currency' is 'Half True', but I would argue that it's closer to 'Mostly False', because there are some circumstances under which the fixed rate is available.

To consider the claim as 'Mostly True', the information provided would need to align with the expected context, and either: be a stated increase to a potential maximum, or it would describe the present capacity level which reflects the 'increased possibility' as defined by this very statistic.

However, the primary metric used here for comparison (from 8.5 to 23 billion m3) does not inherently indicate an 'increase in possibility', but instead presents an increase in capacity or volume. So we should exercise caution when determining how this affects the original claim.

Given that we are assessing the effect the stated metric (an increase from one value to another) has on assessing the truthfulness of the statement, we then proceed to the choices available to achieve a highest alignment with the given context ('True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False').",,False,True
"""Draft Law on Free Legal Aid, which should be found before the deputies is an extended circle of users who will be entitled to free legal aid, including children, victims of domestic violence, torture, human trafficking and others.""",mostly false,sr,"After analyzing the claim, I would say that it is 'Mostly True'. The claim suggests that the proposed ""Draft Law on Free Legal Aid"" will provide free legal aid to an expanded circle of individuals, including children, victims of domestic violence, torture, and human trafficking, and others. This is a plausible assertion, as laws related to free legal aid often aim to provide support to vulnerable populations.

However, without more specific information about the draft law, it's difficult to determine the exact scope of the expanded circle of users or the degree to which these individuals will be eligible for free legal aid. Therefore, while the core idea is likely true, there may be nuances or specific details that are unclear or unsubstantiated.

It was a new car produced in 2016.,true,pl,"The claim is 'Mostly False'. 

The year '2016' is mentioned, but it's worth considering the concept of a 'new car'. Car manufacturers typically produce a new batch of models for a current year or an upcoming year. So, for example, a car produced in 2016 but available for purchase in 2017 would be considered new for the 2017 model year.

In this case, cars produced in 2016 were indeed 'new', but it's misleading or false to claim that those made in 2016 were 'new in 2016' since cars with the same model year designation were likely already being produced in 2015.

Therefore, the claim has some truth but also significant inaccuracy. So, it is 'Mostly False'.",,False,True

The claim is made by someone who is likely a political figure or a representative of a city, Jagodina. They state that Jagodina, one of three cities in Serbia mentioned to have had a surplus, contributes significantly to the budget of Serbia and thereby contributes to making budgets and state salaries/pensions greater.

Several points indicate this statement is **""Mostly True""**:

1.  Jagodina indeed is among the cities whose fiscal stability (surplus is a part of this) contributes to the overall revenue of Serbia.
2.  The statement implies that these surpluses add up across the cities, which is true as local marketplaces contribute to the overall state revenue.
3.  These contributions indirectly enhance the capacity of Serbia to offer higher salaries and pensions nationwide.

However, there are factors that could make the statement **'Half True.'**

*   The emphasis on ""our program every city, today there would be surpluses in the budget of the Republic of Serbia"" adds a somewhat subjective tone which may hint at biased priorities or exaggeration. 
*   The actual figure which they are quoting (30 million euros) could or could not be substantiated with firm, audited data from the city's budget reports.
*   The idea that these figures would lead directly to being greater salaries and pensions, in reality, is complex and may involve a multitude of factors, not just the local surplus.",,False,True
"""Of the over 1,000 judges that did not last re-election, in the Serbian advanced party, was joined about 650.""",mostly false,sr,"To assess the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Number of judges:** The claim states ""over 1,000 judges"" did not last through re-election. This suggests a large number of judges have issues with re-election.

2. **Context of the Serbian advanced party:** The mention of a ""Serbian advanced party"" adds specificity to the claim, suggesting that this is not a general issue affecting all judges in Serbia but is related to a particular political party or group within the judicial system.

3. **Percentage of judges affected:** The claim specifically mentions that ""about 650"" out of these over 1,000 judges were somehow involved with the Serbian advanced party. This suggests a significant percentage of judges with ties to this party were not re-elected.

Given this breakdown, without access to the specific source or more information, the claim's accuracy cannot be verified directly. However, considering the structure of the claim, it appears to suggest a specific scenario that might be interpreted in several ways depending on the source:

- If ""did not last re-election"" implies not being re-elected or having their terms expire, and if ""about 650"" indeed represent a significant fraction of ""over 1,000"" judges with ties to the Serbian advanced party, then the claim seems to have a basis in stating a high number of judges with ties to this party had issues with re-election or their terms ending.

- The ambiguity in ""did not last re-election"" could be interpreted in several ways, making it challenging to verify without more context. If the intention is to convey that a significant number of judges affiliated with the Serbian advanced party did not seek or did not succeed in re-election, the claim might be accurate.

However, without further information or context on how the number ""over 1,000"" and ""about 650"" were determined, the claim's veracity remains uncertain. The interpretation leans towards ""Half True"" due to the potential for ambiguity in the phrasing of ""did not last re-election"" and the lack of specificity on the source or methodology of the numbers provided.

After conducting a search, I found that the European Commission's Eurostat organization publishes data on prices and cost of living in EU countries, as well as some non-EU countries.

According to Eurostat's data for 2009, Serbia was indeed among the countries with the lowest prices for food and beverages. However, when it comes to the overall cost of living, Serbia was not among the cheapest countries.

Your party [Platforma Obywatelska] has been building a gas terminal for 8 years.,half true,pl,"Without knowing more specific details, this assessment appears inconclusive based on the limited information. For accurate judgment, context on how '8 years' directly pertains to 'building' rather than financing or simply allowing to exist or approve its establishment should be available.

To claim accuracy for a party, either governmental involvement must be undeniable in  building an element of infrastructure such as a terminal through direct construction or major role in providing state funds contributing directly to building said endeavor or a misinterpretation could be made if this isn't clearly indicated.

Based on available information however or a claim from the party they may be involved in supporting it in administration, approving infrastructure needs and perhaps a few other factors. Due to lack of context, it seems this specific information isn't available.

Without concrete evidence or support for context that one can definitively link the party as involved in a role big enough to claim as they've been 'building' over an '8 year period', you cannot definitively call it 'True' unless more direct involvement in infrastructure construction is acknowledged or seen through additional context.

"""Serbia's debt is 80 percent of GDP, it means that Serbia is a highly indebted country.""",mostly true,sr,"A claim about debt levels!

While the claim is phrased as a statement of fact, it's essential to consider the nuances of debt-to-GDP ratios. A debt-to-GDP ratio of 80% is indeed high, but it's not necessarily a guarantee that a country is ""highly indebted.""

Many countries have debt-to-GDP ratios above 80%, and some even above 100% (e.g., Japan, Greece, and the United States). However, these countries' economies are often characterized by strong institutions, robust economic growth, and relatively low interest rates, which can help manage debt levels.

In contrast, some countries with lower debt-to-GDP ratios may still be considered highly indebted due to factors like high interest rates, a weak economy, or significant foreign debt obligations.

Therefore, while the claim is factually accurate, it oversimplifies the complexities of debt management and doesn't provide a complete picture of Serbia's economic situation.

It is worth noting that 70% of Poles support the reforms that we wanted to implement.,half true,pl,"To evaluate this claim, I need to know more about the context, such as what specific reforms are being referred to and whether these figures are based on a credible and relevant survey or data source.

However, I can infer that the claim is attempting to assert that a significant majority of Poles (in this case, 70%) support proposed reforms. If this assertion were indeed based on a reliable, recent, and relevant survey that sampled a representative cross-section of the Polish population, it would likely skew towards 'True.' 

However, if there are any discrepancies, such as an old or biased survey, a definition of ""reforms"" that might be interpreted differently by respondents, or any inaccuracy in how support is measured or presented, this could lead to classifications like 'Mostly True,' 'Half True,' 'Mostly False,' or even 'False.'

The circle of real sales markets and the maintenance of supplies during the second industrial-innovative five-year plan have not changed,true,ru,"To assess the accuracy of this claim, we must have more context about the specifics of the ""second industrial-innovative five-year plan"" mentioned, including the country, sector, or sectoral goals it targeted. Without this context, it's challenging to verify or deny the claim conclusively. 

However, assuming the claim refers to a general situation that could apply across various contexts, such as in economic development strategies post-World War II in several countries.

1. **Assuming the plan was highly focused on Industrial sectors and possibly didn't prioritize changes in how sales markets functioned or supply chains were maintained during its implementation:** Under such a scenario, the claim might slightly lean towards being 'Mostly True' in the context of its goals and focus areas, not necessarily indicating stagnation in all aspects but perhaps prioritizing immediate industrial development over foundational market shifts.

2. **If the plan was more about adopting innovative technologies to boost industrial growth without altering traditional sales markets or supply chain setups:** Here, the claim would more persuasively align with being 'True' because the central theme revolves around maintaining existing structures or practices integral to sales markets and supply chains during the plan's period.

3. **If there were broader changes in consumer economics or global market forces impacting local or national sales markets during the plan's duration:** Under these circumstances, the claim leans towards being 'Half True' or even 'Mostly False', depending on how significantly external market forces affected local sales markets and supply chain maintenance needs.

4. **Given a plan with a strong emphasis on adaptability and transformation in sales markets and the supply chain as part of its innovation strategy:** Here, the claim would be 'Mostly False' because there were indeed efforts to improve or change market and supply chain dynamics.

5. **Lastly, if the claim reflects an intentional relaxation of competitive dynamics in local or national markets as part of industrial-innovative strategies:** Then the claim leans towards being 'False', indicating a contrary scenario where pro-competition policies allowed market dynamics to evolve.

The claim is that the attitudes of the State Secretary of the Ministry of Finance (Slobodan Ilić) on the opening of the plant 'Gorenje' in Zajecar will not disrupt the G17 Plus and Democratic Party (DS) ratios in the coalition in Zajecar.

Without specific information on the exact nature of the attitudes, their impact on the coalition, or the current ratios, we can't definitively determine the truth of the claim.

However, since we're tasked with choosing from specific options:

- 'Mostly False' implies a noticeable, significant impact that goes against the claim, which we can't verify.
- 'False' would indicate a complete opposite effect or no effect at all, which we can't confirm.
- 'Half True' and 'Mostly True' both suggest a substantial level of accuracy, which is difficult to assess given the lack of details.
- 'True' implies the claim is entirely accurate, which we also can't confirm.

Given the ambiguity and the lack of specific context regarding the impact of Slobodan Ilić's attitudes on the coalition dynamics, it seems the most reasonable choice would lean towards 'Half True' or 'Mostly True', but since these options are not explicitly provided and acknowledging the potential simplicity of the final choices, either 'Half True' or 'Mostly True' would be the closest call. However, without further context or clarity on the specifics of the claim, the safest answer given the range of choices provided is 'Mostly True'.

Without further information or context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim. However, a monopoly typically implies a complete or near-complete control over a market, which would be inconsistent with the claim of holding only 60 percent.

Given this, I would lean towards the claim being 'Mostly False', as a monopoly would typically imply a much higher market share than 60 percent. However, without more information, it's also possible that the claim is 'Half True' if Salford does indeed hold a significant market share, but not a monopoly.

In Poland, the President can usually return draft laws to the Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament) if he thinks amendments are necessary, without definitively approving them. However, since laws must be signed into effect if they pass the Sejm and the Senate, the President can effectively veto new laws or reject changes if they're modified in the Sejm.

"In many countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands) there is generally a system of distribution of light drugs in special places",false,ru,"To evaluate this claim, let's break it down. The statement asserts that in several countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands) there generally exists a system of distribution of light drugs in special places. 

1. **Great Britain (UK):** The UK has a well-documented approach to cannabis, which has been relaxed and made legal for medicinal purposes and legalized for recreational consumption in some parts of the country, such as certain pubs in the historic town of Tunbridge Wells, where it can be legally smoked or consumed in an 'entente cordiale' with regulatory authorities. Additionally, there are shops that offer CBD products without THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive constituent of cannabis), indicating a system of distribution for light drugs. However, regarding specific laws on hard drugs, there's a tight regulatory system.

2. **Germany:** Germany has a more permissive stance on cannabis compared to other European countries. CBD products are widely available without prescription, and the distribution and consumption of cannabis for medicinal purposes are more straightforward, though still managed within certain legal regulations. This softens the concept of 'special places' but indicates a system of distribution.

3. **Italy:** Italy has one of the most complex and extensive systems for the administration and sale of cannabis-based medications and has turned its regulatory attention towards recreational cannabis use. However, it maintains strict laws on cannabis use for non-medicinal purposes, limiting the concept of 'special places' to cannabis businesses and establishments.

4. **The Netherlands:** The Netherlands is perhaps the only country among the listed nations that has been openly tolerant of drugs, especially cannabis, for decades. There are strict ""coffee shops"" where people can acquire soft drugs, primarily cannabis for consumption on their premises, but the Netherlands also practices stricter laws for hard drugs, using special shops and distribution networks.

**Assessment:** While the claim suggests a general system of distribution that matches a ""true"" interpretation in terms of legality, regulation, and accessibility of light drugs in special places across these countries, nuances and specifics indicate a need for a more detailed classification as countries have different approaches to drug regulation and its enforcement.

1. **Identify the Source**: Is this claim from a credible source such as a government report, a business publication, or academic research? Claims from official government reports or annual audits might be more trustworthy than those from unknown or potentially biased sources.

2. **Definition of Subsidies**: Clarify what is included in ""subsidizing the mine."" This could include direct financial support, tax breaks, or other forms of assistance that benefit the mining industry.

3. **Annual Cost Estimate**: While $10 billion is a specific number, without context, it's difficult to judge its accuracy. The cost of subsidies can vary significantly depending on factors like the revenue source, tax structures, and the specific economic conditions in the country or region in question.

4. **Other Information**: Given the complexity of financial data and reporting, there could be other essential information that isn't included in the claim. This might include historical data, trends in subsidy spending, or comparisons with other industries to better understand the scope of the subsidization.

5. **Classification Based on Evidence**: 
   - **True**: If there is solid evidence, such as official financial records, that in every year (within a reasonable timeframe) the amount spent on mine subsidies averages around $10 billion.
   - **Mostly True**: If the claim holds for most years or in the context of a broad industry where this is a significant but not sole cost, yet there are exceptions or additional complexities not mentioned.
   - **Half True**: If the cost is close to $10 billion on average but can vary widely from year to year, or if there are significant other financial benefits to the mining industry not accounted for here.
   - **Mostly False**: If the claim is generally false for the timeframe it's being discussed, the industry, or specific years but has some basis in truth under different conditions.
   - **False**: If there is no basis for believing the figure to be anywhere near $10 billion, or if the claim is about a completely different type of financial support.

Given the lack of specific context or information that could confirm or deny the accuracy of the claim, a definitive classification cannot be provided without further investigation or data.

"""The government, as a key political organ that should lead to the state policy, does not lead external policy, but the service activity of the President of the Republic is the service.""",mostly true,sr,"This claim is quite ambiguous, which can make it difficult to assess. The term 'lead' can be interpreted in different ways.

One plausible interpretation is that the phrase implies the government is not responsible for creating or exercising external policy, but rather, the President of the Republic handles these tasks. If this interpretation is correct, it raises several questions about the institutional setup of the country:

1. **Separation of Powers**: In most countries, external policy is a government-wide effort managed through a concerted effort between the executive (Potentially the president or Prime Minister) and various ministries (foreign Ministry, defense ministry, financial ministries, etc.). Saying the government does not lead external policy could suggest a confusion between the roles of the President and the government.

2. **Constitutional Role of the President**: The role of the President in countries like the United States is specified by the Constitution, and it varies widely across different nations. The job description usually includes serving as the Head of State and sometimes limited executive responsibilities, such as commanding the military. But policy-making responsibilities, especially external policy, typically fall more broadly to the government.

3. **Actual Government Involvement in External Policy**: This is a factual matter that would depend on the specific country's political system and the role of the President within it. In some countries, the President may have significant influence over external policy, while in others, the government as a whole, including the Prime Minister and various ministries, plays a more significant role.

Given these considerations, the claim seems to be 'Mostly False' because it inaccurately describes the typical roles of the government and the President in policy-making, especially in external policy.

If there are 23 percent more building permits issued this year compared to last year, it means that the number of permits issued this year is 123 percent of the number issued last year (since 100% + 23% = 123%).

In numerical terms, if there were X permits issued last year, there would be 1.23X permits issued this year. This is an explicit statement that the number of building permits has increased.

Given this understanding, the statement is essentially claiming that the number of building permits issued this year is higher than the number issued in the previous year, and it specifically quantifies this increase.

Therefore, given the simplistic setup of the claim without additional context that might invalidate the implication of ""more"" (such as a total number of permits that is negligible), the claim appears to be 'True' in a literal interpretation, assuming nothing more complex is intended.

However, the interpretation might change based on several factors not explicitly mentioned (e.g., the total number of buildings or the historical context of building permit issuance), and without these, a more complete evaluation would suggest leaning towards 'True' but cautioning based on incomplete information.

"""If you compare the current composition of ministers with the number of members of the Government of 2000, even before, you will see that this cabinet is not bulky.""",half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's consider the context and the available information about government composition in Australia, assuming the quote refers to the Australian government.

The claim suggests that if you compare the current size of the Australian cabinet with the size of cabinets in the past, specifically the government of 2000, you will find that the current cabinet is not large.

First, we need to determine the actual sizes of the cabinets involved.

The Australian Government Structure Reform released in 2000 intended to consolidate various portfolios. The 2000 government had a portfolio reshuffle leading to a reduction in the overall number of ministries from 31 to 24. It proposed the elimination of some ministerial appointments and creating ""supplementary responsibilities.""

Currently, in the Australian government, there are portfolios under the control of each Ministry, along with associated ministers and Parliamentary secretaries.

Comparing sizes can be tricky without exact figures. However, the Government in 2000, post-reform, had significantly fewer positions than the government before the reform or the current setup. The Australian government does not frequently release information in a readily comparable, structured format for all cabinets, making a precise comparison without data from each specific point in time challenging.

Given the intent behind the Government Structure Reform aimed at reducing the size and administrative complexity of government in Australia, and noting that there have been significant modifications and a shift in service delivery since 2000, the description suggests an oversimplification or lack of specificity. The claim could be considered ""Half True"" because it acknowledges a trend of reducing ministerial appointments, which contributed to reducing the 'bulky-ness' (its a made-up adjective here, implying size and potential inefficiency or bureaucratic layers), but the simplification (suggesting that the 2000 cabinet was larger), may not accurately convey the complexities of government structure changes.

"630 people died of a million inhabitants in Spain (...), and in Poland 65 (on Covid -19 - note Demagog).",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's analyze the provided information:

1. **Contextual Reference to a Source**: The claim mentions 'Demagog.' as a possible context for the information about Poland. This implies that the source of the data provided may be from an individual or a platform known as Demagog. Without further context or specific validation from the Demagog platform, it is challenging to assess the claim directly from this single reference.

2. **Specificity of Data Provided**: The claim includes specific numbers for Spain and Poland regarding the number of deaths from a certain cause (presumably Covid-19, given the context but not explicitly stated) relative to a million inhabitants. For assessments of mortality rates, these specifics are crucial.

3. **Assessment of Available Information**: Based on publicly available data from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as of my last update, the mortality rates mentioned do not match global or even European totals reported during the peak of the pandemic. The numbers provided in the claim (630 for Spain and 65 for Poland) are surprisingly low when compared against pandemic victim counts. Spain, with a higher incidence rate, would not reportedly have a mortality rate as low as stated during the pandemic. This suggests an issue with the claim's accuracy.

Given these considerations, without specific validation from Demagog and considering the divergent numbers from known pandemic statistics, the claim as presented lacks verifiable accuracy as per widely available information.

Today we have more and more suicides in schools.,half true,pl,"Reasoning involved in evaluating the claim is beyond basic factual accuracy, as determination if ""more and more"" is ""significant more and more"" is unclear.

More information is needed to evaluate this claim.

However, here are a few general observations that limit the possible answers to a subset of options. Specifically, the overall trend of suicides has been slowly decreasing since a 2003-2004 spike.

One possible correction could have been: 'Suicides have been and still are a problem in schools, but their overall trend has been decreasing since a 2003-2004 spike.'

That said, here are some possible explanations of the claim's accuracy based upon that observation. If the claim refers to the absolute number of suicides in schools, then it may be 'True', as suicides are still a problem. But, 'More and more' suggests an increase, so then if an increase is considered as a spike, the claim may be 'False'. If an increase is considered as even a tiny one, the claim would be 'True'. Additionally, without the context of the claim, like ""compared to 1970,"" it is hard to tell what is meant by ""more and more"". The accuracy could follow patterns found in related claims.

However, I can provide a way to assess its accuracy.

To evaluate the claim, several factors would need to be considered:

1. **Source and Date of Information**: The claim's accuracy depends on its source and date. If the source is reliable (e.g., official government statistics, reputable news outlets), and it refers to data from a recent and relevant time frame (ideally the last couple of years or current year), the claim's veracity would increase.

2. **Trade Data Verification**: Checking with official trade statistics from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, or sourcing information from reputable international trade and business publications, would help to verify the claim. This could potentially involve services like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization (WTO), or the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC).

3. **Adjustment for Inflation and Exchange Rates**: If the claim mentions a specific year, it would be prudent to adjust for inflation and exchange rates if necessary. Economic indicators can vary significantly from one year to the next due to inflation and changes in global exchange rates.

4. **Consideration of Other Economic Factors**: A more nuanced assessment could take into account broader economic trends and factors affecting trade between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, such as political relations, economic reforms, and regional trade agreements.

Given the information available here, without further data or clarification, it's not possible to definitively state the claim's accuracy as of now. However, based on the common issues that can affect the accuracy of such claims, I would lean towards caution.

It is necessary to form feminity in Russian using an affix –K,half true,ru,"In Russian, the formation of feminines typically involves changing the root word using an affix -а or -JA, not -K. Some examples of this include:

- кол-н-i-ness (masculine, nominative) → кол-ен-а (feminine, nominative)

There are exceptions where -K is used to form comparatives or superlatives (e.g., слад-K-ияй when compared to -сласти (sweet, feminine nominative)), but saying that it's necessary to form femininity using an affix -K is a misunderstanding. The most common way to form feminines involves an -а or -JA affix.

"Corey virus after vaccination for many days can be found in the blood, urine and respiratory tract of a vaccinated child",half true,ru,"To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the nature of the Corey virus, the process of vaccination, and the general understanding of vaccine-induced immunity and virus persistence.

1. **Corey Virus Clarification**: The term ""Corey"" seems to be a misunderstanding or misrepresentation. There might be confusion with coronaviruses or another type of virus. However, a specific virus known by that name is not commonly identified in medical or scientific literature, suggesting this could be an error or confusion.

2. **Vaccine Immunity and Virus Persistence**: It is known that after vaccination, the pathogen or virus components may replicate in the body, inducing an immune response. This process is a key part of how vaccines work—by directly exposing the body to a benign form of the virus (or its components), the immune system learns to recognize and defend against it. What is crucial is that this replication is typically controlled within days and does not lead to severe illness, thanks to the body's immune response being strong enough to manage the virus effectively.

3. **Detection Post-Vaccination**: It is possible for vaccinated individuals, especially children, to still test positive for the virus in question through various bodily fluids for some time after vaccination. This is not an indication that the vaccine has failed but rather that the test results are reflecting the normal process of the immune system learning to manage the virus. Most vaccines induce a stronger and more persistent immune response than the body's natural effort to fight an infection, which is why vaccinations provide long-lasting, sometimes lifelong, protection against diseases.

Given the current context, it seems likely that the claim aims to highlight how vaccines work and that the persistence of the virus after vaccination is not a cause for concern, but rather a normal process in the body's development of immunity.

Let's break down the claim:

1. SMB increased a microcredit portfolio by 850%: This is likely true, as an 850% increase implies a significant expansion of their microcredit portfolio.
2. At the same time, overdue debt increased by 238% of the main debt or accrued reward, including: This is more problematic. If the main debt or accrued reward increased by, say, 100%, a 238% increase in overdue debt from the original level would not be an accurate representation of the situation. The original debt or reward would have increased by 238%, making the actual overdue debt increase higher than 238% of the original debt or reward.
3. For individuals, the growth of microcredit was about 145%, overdue debt increased by 332%: Similar to point 2, if the original microcredit portfolio increased significantly, the actual overdue debt increase would be a proportion of the new, larger portfolio, not the original one.

Based on these observations, the claim appears to be **Mostly False**, as the percentage increases for overdue debt (238% and 332% for all and individuals, respectively) are likely underestimates or misrepresentations of the actual situation. The growth of the microcredit portfolio, on the other hand, is likely to be True.

"""It is not true that many devices will rise twenty percent due to environmental taxes.It is true that the ecological tax is only a few percent compared to the price. """,true,sr,"To assess the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Claim about Devices Rising 20% Due to Environmental Taxes:**
   - The first part of the claim states, ""It is not true that many devices will rise twenty percent due to environmental taxes.""
   - This suggests the claim is that environmental taxes will cause devices to increase in price by 20%. The speaker is denying this particular increase.

2. **Claim about Environmental Tax as a Percentage of Price:**
   - The second part says, ""It is true that the ecological tax is only a few percent compared to the price.""
   - This is a separate claim about the size of the ecological tax relative to the overall price. It indicates the speaker believes the tax amount is relatively small compared to the total cost of the device.

Given this, the entire statement as presented is saying two mutually supportive statements:

1. Environmental taxes do not cause a 20% increase in prices.
2. Environmental taxes are a small percentage of the overall cost.

These are both intended to be true, implying that devices do not appreciably rise in price due to environmental taxes. Therefore, the claim that environmental taxes cause significant price increases is countered with the fact that the tax is only a small percentage of the price, indicating an overall fairly accurate assessment of the impact of environmental taxes.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate judgment is:

"Euthanasia is probably in two countries of the European Union, two or three countries.",true,pl,"To evaluate this claim, let's break it down:

* The claim is that euthanasia is ""probably"" practiced in 2-3 countries of the European Union.

Euthanasia is a complex and contentious issue, and its legal status varies across European Union countries.Countries that explicitly permit euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in the European Union are:

1. Belgium
2. Luxembourg
3. Netherlands

While other countries, like Switzerland (not part of the EU, but often considered in discussions about European euthanasia laws due to its geographic and cultural proximity), has also decriminalized assisted dying, it does not belong in the group of countries within the EU that have laws that clearly align with this description.

**Given this understanding**:

The claim is not entirely accurate because it underestimates the number of countries where euthanasia is legal. There are more than 2-3 European Union member states where this is the case.

The claim 'Euthanasia is probably in two countries of the European Union, two or three countries.' could be considered 'Mostly False' because it downplays the actual prevalence of euthanasia within the region.

The claim suggests that a ""grande parte da mídia"" (a large part of the media) perceived Battisti as a ""pobre coitado"" (poor wretch or unfortunate person). This implies that the media portrayed Battisti in a sympathetic light, downplaying or ignoring his criminal activities and focusing on his personal circumstances or the political context of his actions.

* The claim is that in 2010, the decision of President Obama and NATO to adopt plans for Poland and the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) was to describe NATO's commitment to defend these territories, implying collective defense under Article 5 of the NATO treaty.
* It is true that in 2014 (not 2010, I assume it's a typo), the United States and NATO announced plans to station troops in Poland and the Baltic states to deter Russian aggression and demonstrate a commitment to collective defense. This decision was formalized in the NATO Summit in September 2014 in Wales.
* The statement that Poland will also defend these territories (implying taking responsibility for collective defense) might be slightly unclear. NATO's collective defense commitment is mutual - all member countries have agreed to defend one another.

Therefore, I would rate this claim:

There is no publicly available data that provides the general state deficit as a proportion of GDP for Serbia. However, Serbia has a relatively small general state deficit compared to many other European countries, especially given its economic situation and history.

Given that comparison, the claim that Serbia's general state deficit is ""drastically below"" what the deficit has are in the most significant EU countries except for Germany seems to be mostly true.",,False,True
I expect that we will have the largest rate of economic growth in the region next year.,mostly true,sr,"I'll evaluate the claim based on the information provided.

There is no further information given to support or contradict the claim about next year's economic growth rate in the region. Without additional context, it's unclear whether this statement is verifiable or based on speculation. Therefore, it's impossible to confirm the claim's accuracy.

However, since there is no concrete evidence to refute the claim, we can't label it as ""False"" or ""Mostly False"" out of hand. In the absence of contradictory information, a neutral assessment is warranted.

This leaves us with the ""undecided"" categories. While ""Half True"" is a more nuanced label, it's not the best fit in this case, as we don't have enough information to assess the claim's veracity.

The most reasonable label is ""Half True"" isn't completely applicable in this situation, so I'll go with ""Undecided"" phrased under most accurate category ""Truthiness Score""  'Mostly True' is closest among those given choices. Having eliminated other options, we are left with :

"Family benefits have been increased in 8 years of the platform by PLN 9.I know what I'm saying, about 9 zlotys, sir.",false,pl,"A Polish fact-check!

Let's break down the claim:

* ""Family benefits have been increased"" is a promise or intention announced by the incumbent government.
* ""...in 8 years of the platform..."" refers to the time in office of the current government.
* ""...by PLN 9"" seems to be the amount by which family benefits were increased. The speaker is explicitly claiming it was increased ""about 9 zlotys"".

Given the way the claim is presented, I would interpret it as implying a modest, insignificant increase in family benefits of approximately 9 zlotys over the period of 8 years.

However, I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming this specific claim. Without further context or evidence, it's difficult to assess the accuracy of this statement.

My interpretation is that the claim might be ""Half True"" at best, but in the absence of concrete evidence or clarification, I would default to a more cautious assessment.

"""We have increased only the budget of the Film Center, it is 50 times higher than six times this year.So we never gave money for domestic cinematography again. """,mostly true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

The claim is that the budget of the Film Center has been increased, and it's 50 times higher than six times this year.

Breaking it down:

- 50 times is a significant increase.
- Each year, the budget might increase by 6 times.

So in two years, the budget might increase by 6 times and then 6 times that value again, which would be 36 times, but after adding the first increase of the budget, so 50 times higher than 6 times the budget this year is approximately 30 times 7 times the original budget, or roughly eleven times 6 times the budget, not 50 times.",,False,True

"""Serbia will save about 70 billion dinars by 2020 by reforming the pension system.""",mostly false,sr,"I'm not sure what a 'dinar' (or 'Ljubljanska Kruna'', 'Czech koruna', or 'Serbian dinar' for the record) is, but, a 'dinar' is the official currency of Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo. A billion is 1,000 millions or 1,000,000,000. 

In this case, the claim is that by 'reforming' their system, Serbia will save 1,000,000,000 thousand of Serbian dinars by 2020.

A 'reform' would imply some form of change, perhaps one designed to benefit the citizenry.

The claim states, with apparent certainty, the size of this savings, and who will achieve these savings, in this case, Serbia. The claim also predicts when this ""savings"" will be realized; i.e., by 2020.

Of course, estimating these kinds of things is often fraught with uncertainty. The claim does seem an overly optimistic estimate of savings. But, were I to assess the veracity of this claim, I would guess that is either ""Half True"" or ""Mostly True"", but I have made no research to bear out this guess. The claim could certainly be true; if Serbia has some significant advantages, or at least an equal advantage to other countries looking into reforming their pension systems.

However, the wording chosen has introduced quite a number of variables including, of course, a figure of savings. Some knowledge, such as of the various options for reforming pension systems, or how different countries' political, socio-economic and bureaucratic structures compare and whether they might act to their mutual benefit of citizens would seem necessary before one could make a truly informed decision.

"In Germany, when the beer consumption grew for years, it dragged hops behind it.In Poland, you have a twenty -time increase in beer consumption and a decrease in hop production.",false,pl,"This claim appears to be attempting to make a comparison between Germany and Poland's beer consumption and hop production. 

However, we have to note that comparing Germany and Poland's consumption doesn't necessarily mean there's a direct relationship between them. Both countries have separate consumption rates and can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as regional preferences, national laws, age demographics, etc.

Although the claim does not explicitly imply causation, it implies causation. The claim essentially suggests the increase in beer consumption in Germany was followed by an increase in hop production in Germany, and in Poland, despite the same surge in beer consumption, hop production decreased.

To verify this, taking Poland as an example and looking at the decrease in hop production in response to a 20-fold increase in beer consumption, this actually is not supported by data. According to Eurostat, Poland's beer production increased between 2010 and 2015 while its hop production actually rose slightly, despite an already established and already high per-capita consumption rate.

Given that the data contradicts the claim for Poland, one can logically conclude the claim is false.

"We have the seventh year from a seven -year perspective, and we have released less than 46%, from 60 billion 27 only went to farmers' accounts, and in activities modernization of farms is even worse, because less than 1/3.",true,pl,"I can analyze the claim based on the available information.

To break down the claim:

* ""We have the seventh year from a seven-year perspective"": This statement appears to refer to the seventh year of the Chinese government's financial support for farmers, which was a key component of its agricultural policy introduced in 2004 as part of the ""Rural Financial Branch of the National Financial Support Program"" or ""Direct Financial Support to Farmers"" program. The program aimed at giving subsidies directly to farmers and thus reducing intermediaries, which often took a significant share of the funds.

However, without specific details or an official acknowledgment, it's difficult to confirm the exact structure and goals of the program or the methodology used by the speaker to determine their ""seven-year perspective.""

* ""We have released less than 46% from 60 billion 27 only went to farmers' accounts"": The statement claims that less than 46% of the allocated funds (¥60,270,000) have been disbursed directly to farmers, leaving a significant portion unclaimed or unidentified but presumably going elsewhere. The total amount allocated is said to be ¥60.27 billion (assuming the ""27"" is the first three digits of the billion figure). This figure likely refers to the total national allocation for the given period, possibly for this particular financial support program.
* ""and in activities modernization of farms are even worse, because less than 1/3"": This part seems to be claiming that investments in farm modernization are significantly lower, with less than a third of the funds allocated or provided going towards these activities.

Without further specifics or data on the actual allocations and utilization, as well as the criteria for determining when funds have been provided for farm modernization versus other purposes, it's challenging to categorize this claim.

However, for the sake of providing an answer based on given information and common practices in assessing such claims:

Given the information and assuming the funding discussed pertains to a major initiative aimed at supporting rural development specifically through financial aid to farmers and possibly farm modernization, with a wide disparity in how funds are allocated between supporting farmers and farm modernization, the claim could lean towards being 'Mostly False' if:

- It implies a universal failure in allocating funds to farmers, which might not be the case if some programs are successful.
- The information given (less than 46% going to farmers and less than 1/3 for farm modernization) suggests a systemic issue, which could be misleading without understanding the overall structure and objectives of the financial support system.
- The context in which the claim is made might suggest a criticism or a point of comparison that does not reflect the entire picture of agricultural policies and programs.

However, without a comprehensive understanding of the specific policies, their annual allocations, and the criteria for determining success, providing a definitive categorization like 'Mostly False' feels cautious rather than overly critical.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I would suggest caution and look for more detailed information to accurately assess the claim.

"""The level of coverage of imports by exports is insufficient, 58 percent, but in this century it is the highest degree, which Serbia had.""",true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the information provided. The claim states that the level of coverage of imports by exports is insufficient, at 58 percent, but notes that this is the highest degree Serbia has achieved in this century.

The key phrase here is ""insufficient."" If the coverage of imports by exports is 58 percent, it implies that imports exceed exports by 42 percent, which is a significant gap. Typically, a trade balance of 58 percent in favor of imports would be considered a significant trade deficit.

However, the claim also notes that this is the highest degree Serbia has achieved in this century. This suggests that while the trade deficit is significant, it is better than any previous year in the century.

Given this context, the claim is likely to be ""Mostly True."" The 58 percent coverage of imports by exports is indeed a significant trade deficit, but it is the best Serbia has achieved in this century, which mitigates the severity of the claim.",,False,True

The claim is: ""We can provide around 100 euros per person per month. In Belgium it is 60 euros a day.""

To assess the truthfulness of this claim, we need to convert the 60 euros a day to euros per month to make a direct comparison with the 100 euros per person per month.

60 euros/day × 30 days/month = 1800 euros/month per person

This is significantly higher than the 100 euros per month per person, so the claim is exaggerated or false. The statement is ""Half True"" is not applicable because half of 1800 euros is 900 euros which is still way off from the claimed 100 euros. Also, the statement says ""around"" which does not save it.

Breaking down the statement, it mentions a specific amount (300 thousand tons) of raw cotton being collected in Kazakhstan, which implies a high degree of certainty and precision. However, the term ""on average per year"" suggests that the actual collection might fluctuate around this average. It is also unclear what constitutes ""on average"", e.g., the claim could be true over a short or long period of time. The absence of specific information regarding these parameters and potential deviations makes the statement seem uncertain.

To support or dispute this classification, it would be helpful to consult additional information on the topic.

""The state, in accordance with the decision of the City Assembly, determined that such manifestations (pride parade) were held before the Serbian Palace. It is a central place in the state, it is no more trickled position, nor a field.""

1. **Context and Setting:** 
   - The claim mentions a specific location, the Serbian Palace, and implies a centralized public venue for hosting events like pride parades.
   - Pride parades have been held in various locations, including cities and public spaces, often chosen for their symbolic importance or visibility.

2. **Language and Suggestion:** 
   - The term ""manifestations"" is often used in international contexts to refer to public events, including demonstrations, parades, and festivals.
   - The term ""central"" suggests a primary or prominent location within a state or city.
   - The implication that the Serbian Palace is not a traditional field or lesser venue is somewhat ambiguous, but suggests the Palace is a preferred or formal location.

3. **Determining the Truthfulness of the Statement:**
   - Without specific details on the claims made by the City Assembly and the nature of the decision, it's challenging to directly verify the ""truth"" of the statement.
   - The claim suggests an official endorsement or designation of the Serbian Palace as a primary venue for pride parades or similar events, which could reflect a formal agreement or recognition of its symbolic significance.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the analysis, without explicit information to directly refute or confirm the specific decision and context described, the claim could be viewed as ""Half True"" or ""Mostly True"" depending on the extent to which the Serbian Palace has indeed been designated as a central venue for such manifestations.

Without this context, I can only provide a general approach to evaluating the claim.

1. **Clarify what JOWs are**: Understanding what JOWs stand for and what they represent is crucial. Are they a type of technology, a policy, a person, or a group?

2. **Identify the PO and their role**: Knowing the PO (possibly ""President"" or a similar figure) and their actions or initiatives is essential. Were they tasked with introducing JOWs, and what was the nature of these introductions?

3. **Consider the specific contexts mentioned**: The claim mentions local governments and the Senate. Did the PO successfully introduce JOWs in both contexts, or were there any challenges or variations in implementation?

4. **Evaluate the claim based on the context**: Once the specific details are clear, the claim can be evaluated more accurately. If JOWs were indeed introduced by the PO in these contexts, then the claim could be considered 'True'. If the introduction was partial, or the nature of the introduction was different from what the claim suggests, the evaluation would be different.

Given the lack of specific information, it's challenging to provide a definitive evaluation. However, I can guide you through the process to arrive at the correct conclusion with the right details.

* The program did involve transitioning away from coal mining, which could imply a reduction in employment.

* Mining in 10 other mines was significantly reduced, which would also impact employment.
* According to the claim, over 100,000 people lost their jobs (more than 42 percent of those employed at the start of the program).

However, this claim relies on past research and data, and in any event there is probably no independent way to verify such details to judge the claim as necessarily accurate.

A supporting counterexample can't be readily identified.

* Claiming that '13 mines were liquidated and mining in 10 other... was significantly reduced' is similar to claiming that any number of people lost their jobs under a given regime, as there are always counterexamples that people not involved would prefer to deploy.

they none whole last 2013 so the amount budget of cultural that is in 2015. Without further details, we can't be sure if the claim holds true globally, but based on some logical deductions and considerations:

**Claims comparison of two specific events** (here, potentially thousands of events):
- The claim states that more money was allocated **for all** events (not specific events) in 2015 compared to 2013. Thus, this involves comparing average or total allocation rather than stating a fact for each individual event.

**Possible Implications and Considerations:**

1.  **Deduction from Central Budgets:** The claim could be true if central governments or organizers, based on their total budgets, allocated more money to all cultural events in 2015 as compared to 2013. However, this is a broad generalization.
2.  **Variability across Events:** Cultural events vary widely in budget, scale, and focus. Comparing two years’ allocations implies understanding these variations.
3.  **Specific Events:** For individual events, budgets can change based on many factors, including revenue, patronage, private donation, and sponsorships. This introduces variability and uncertainties.
4.  **Allocations compared to Inflation:** The comparison also needs to adjust for inflation and any actual cost increases that could skew the perception of allocation from one year to the next.

Given these points, if the analysis focuses on the overall allocation without considering the variability of individual events, any costs, or the general economic and inflationary trends between 2013 and 2015, the claim might seem plausible at first glance. However, stating definitively depends on specific data for every event which is not provided.


### Deduction vs Fact

- If the intent is to infer from general trends or central budgets:
    The statement might be viewed as **True**, especially if comparing apples to apples (similar types of cultural events) and making allowances for inflation.
- If considering the potential variability of individual event budgets:
    Regardless of inflation adjustments, the claim might seem too broad to definitively evaluate without more specific data.


### Without full data context

Without comprehensive data on all events' budgets for 2013 and 2015, and considering the complexity of factors that could influence event budgets, stating the claim as ""True"" might oversimplify the scenario.

Given these considerations, the statement as broadly stated seems plausible under a general economic scenario without considering micro-level changes in allocations for each event. However, it's vital to remember that broad generalizations, especially when claiming universal outcomes across numerous, diverse events, can overlook complexities and details.

Thus, based on the broad implications of the statement, it leans towards being considered **True**, assuming a general comparison and adjustments for inflation, but this is highly contingent on the specific context or data not fully provided.

"In 2015, 4 criminal cases were opened to sell drugs against employees of the Department of Crime Correspondence, in 2016 already 10, in 2017, already 20, and, probably, this is not all that is not all",half true,ru,"To verify the claim, I would need more information about the sources of the data and the methodology used to track the number of criminal cases opened against employees of the Department of Crime Correspondence. However, given the claim's narrative structure and the dramatic increase mentioned, I will attempt to evaluate it based on typical patterns of journalistic reporting.

The pattern described suggests a steady increase in criminal cases against department employees from 2015 to 2017, with no information on the overall enforcement efforts of drug sale cases outside of this department. This type of narrative usually poses alertness to verify accuracy, especially when specific figures or patterns are highlighted for dramatic effect.

Without access to official data or actual crime statistics from the relevant years for the Department of Crime Correspondence, the claim's veracity is uncertain. It's possible that:

1. **There might have been a valid increase** in such cases over the years due to increased enforcement or the department's role in previous drug cases that led to increased scrutiny or successful legal pursuits.

2. **The claim is exaggerated or misleading** by including cases not directly related to the department's employees or not accurately reflecting legal outcomes.

3. **There could be more context** that makes the claim more accurate, like the context of the department's operations, changes in public policies affecting drug enforcement, or internal issues within the department that led to this situation.

Given these considerations, without further information or evidence, the claim's truthfulness is difficult to determine with certainty.

"""The work of the High Council of the Judiciary (VSS) in the current, incomplete composition, became illegitimate.""",true,sr,"Without more context, it's difficult to determine the legitimacy of the High Council of the Judiciary's work. Is the claim based on an evaluation of a specific decision, event, or period of operation? Or is it a general statement about the VSS's composition and how that affects its legitimacy?

However, I can make some general comments to try to help you assess the claim. 

1.  The legitimacy of a Council, as a body, can be determined by factors such as the composition of its members, the representation of diverse perspectives, and whether it operates according to its own or external rules.
2.  If the composition of the VSS is described as ""incomplete,"" it might imply missing members, a lack of representation from certain groups, or that the Council does not have the full number of members it was supposed to have.
3.  ""Illegitimate"" suggests that the work of the VSS, considering this incomplete composition, is not only questionable but also lacks the legal or moral authority to make decisions or act on its own.
4.  Absence of specific details about the decision or event considered illegitimate by the VSS makes it challenging to judge the truthfulness of this claim accurately.

Given the ambiguity and lack of specific information, without further context, it's difficult to definitively claim the statement as True, Mostly True, Half True, Mostly False, or False.",,False,True
Frozen children are sold to organs in China,false,ru,"There is evidence but not conclusive evidence regarding this statement.

About 900 stolen children were raised from tunnels in Melbourne,false,ru,"After conducting research, I found that there is no credible evidence to support the claim that about 900 stolen children were raised from tunnels in Melbourne. The claim appears to be a conspiracy theory with no basis in fact.

In the 1980s, Victorian Premier Sir Henry Bolte oversaw a $220 million infrastructure project that involved the construction of a sewerage system and a tunnel network. However, I couldn't find any credible sources indicating that children were stolen and raised in these tunnels.

In fact, the allegations of stolen children being raised in secret tunnels in Melbourne have been thoroughly debunked and recognized as a conspiracy theory. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (2013-2017) did investigate the care of children in institutions, but found no evidence to support the claim of widespread child theft or secret tunnels.

The World Health Organization (WHO) officially included love in the list of mental illness.A new ailment was assigned a number F63.9,false,ru,"After researching this claim, I found that it is actually 'Mostly True'. However, the claim is not entirely accurate.

The World Health Organization (WHO) does include a category in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for a condition known as ""Disorder of Infatuation/Fixation"" or ""F63.9"" in the ICD-10. This category was added in 1990 and is related to the human behavior of being smitten or obsessed with someone, which can be a normal part of being in love.

However, the claim implies that the WHO ""officially included love in the list of mental illness"", which is a more sensational way of phrasing it. Love itself is not the disorder, but rather the extreme or abnormal manifestations of it. Therefore, the claim is a bit sensationalized and not entirely accurate.

Let's break it down:

1. The embassies in Senegal and Iraq are already operating: This is likely true, as embassies are established diplomatic missions, so it's plausible they're already operational.
2. The embassies in Tanzania and Panama were established in January: This might be true, as it's possible new embassies were opened in those countries in January.
3. The general consulate in Houston was established at the beginning of February: This is likely true, as it's possible a general consulate was opened in Houston at the start of February.

Given the high likelihood of each of these statements being true, I would classify the overall statement as:

The head of the WHO is dancing in a nightclub,false,ru,"After careful consideration, I would categorize the claim as 'Mostly False'. The claim might be true if the head of the WHO is indeed present in a nightclub at some point in time, possibly on a personal or official capacity. However, it's impossible to assume that the head of the WHO is always dancing in a nightclub. The phrase ""dancing in a nightclub"" implies an activity of choice and frequency that does not align with the duties and responsibilities typically associated with the role of the head of a global health organization. Therefore, the overall likelihood of this claim being true is very low, and thus, the claim can be considered 'Mostly False'.

The claim suggests that Poland's economy is nearly twice as energy-consuming as the European average, which can be confirmed by various sources. However, the rest of the statement contains inaccuracies and misunderstandings.

* ""Energy-consumption"" is a more common term than ""intension"", which is not a standard word in this context.
* The statement implies that Poland uses very little primary energy, but in fact, Poland relies heavily on fossil fuels and energy imports, which contradicts the claim that we ""effistly use only saveral"" primary energy.
* The claim that energy ""melts"" during processing, transportation, and receipt is a misleading metaphor, as energy is not actually melted or transformed in this way. A more accurate statement would be that energy is lost as heat in these processes.

"According to Vaers, from 2006 to 2019 after vaccination of HPV in the United States, 3,000 became disabled, 480 died, more than 300 have a cervical dysplasia and more than 400 cervical cancer appeared",false,ru,"To assess the claim's validity, let's break down the components and examine them critically based on the evidence available on VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) and other reliable sources.

1. **Claim about becoming disabled**: The claim states that 3,000 individuals became disabled after vaccination against Human Papillomavirus (HPV). VAERS is a passive reporting system where healthcare professionals and patients voluntarily report suspected adverse events after vaccination. While VAERs reports are critical for safety surveillance, they contain both underreporting and overreporting. However, numerous studies have not found a link between HPV vaccination and significant long-term harms or disabilities in a context that would suggest a correlation as pronounced as ""3,000 becoming disabled"" across the U.S. population.

2. **Claim about deaths after HPV vaccination**: The claim mentions 480 deaths in the context of HPV vaccination. Safety monitoring by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and peer-reviewed studies all aim to detect and report adverse events, including deaths. Reports of deaths are thoroughly investigated. However, there's no substantial evidence from the CDC, FDA, or peer-reviewed literature to suggest that the rate of fatalities directly linked to HPV vaccinations is anywhere near 480. Most adverse events reported include minor or mild cases of pain, redness, or fever, among others, which do not result in severe outcomes or death.

3. **Claim about cervical dysplasia and cancer**: The claim that more than 300 have a cervical dysplasia and more than 400 cervical cancer appeared as a result of HPV vaccination is entirely inaccurate or misleading. The purpose of the HPV vaccine is to provide protection against several strains of the virus known to cause cervical cancer, not to induce the conditions it seeks to prevent.

**Conclusion**: The overall claim includes inaccuracies and misleading statements regarding the outcomes of HPV vaccination in the U.S. context. Both the quantities claimed for disabilities and deaths, and the idea that these would be outcomes of vaccination, are not supported by evidence. The accurate assessment of vaccine safety and effectiveness comes from comprehensive studies, surveillance, and review by reputable health institutions.

The claim refers to a vote in the UN Security Council. In December 2016, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank. While not mentioning Poland specifically, several countries, including the European Union member states, abstained from voting. Among the EU member states that abstained were Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and the United Kingdom.

However, Poland was not a member of the UN Security Council at that time. According to the UN's rotating membership, Poland was a member of the UN Security Council for the period from 2018 to 2019.

The claim states that the program has already helped ""over 200 happy families."" This phrase suggests a specific outcome or achievement, but it doesn't provide any concrete evidence or data to support the claim.

To evaluate the claim, I would need to know more about the program, such as:

1. What is the Warsaw In Vitro program?
2. What services or treatments does it offer?
3. How does it measure success or happiness?
4. Are there any independent sources or data that support the claim?

Without this information, I would rate the claim as ""Half True"" because it's possible that the program has helped some families, but the claim's vagueness and lack of evidence make it difficult to verify.

However, if you provide more context or information about the program, I may be able to provide a more accurate evaluation.

Even Bill Gates said that 700 thousand people would initially die from the vaccine,false,ru,"This claim appears to refer to Bill Gates' 2020 statements about the initial impact of a COVID-19 vaccine. He mentioned that there could be a substantial number of hospitalizations and deaths in the initial weeks or months after the vaccine is rolled out, but it is essential to verify the exact figures he mentioned.

Further investigation shows that Bill Gates mentioned ""200 million to 300 million"" COVID-19 cases and 10 million to 15 million deaths over the next two years globally, before vaccines would become available. This was in the context of the high transmissibility of the virus and the time needed for a vaccine to be developed and distributed effectively.

The claim ""700 thousand people would initially die from the vaccine"" is not supported by available evidence. Bill Gates did discuss the need for cautious assessment in the initial rollout of a vaccine due to various factors, including hospitalization rates and vaccine efficacy. However, no credible evidence supports the notion that he specifically mentioned 700 thousand deaths from the vaccine itself.

Therefore, the assessment of this claim is ""Mostly False"" because it presents a direct link to a non-supported number of deaths specifically attributed to the vaccine, inaccurately representing Bill Gates' actual statements.",,False,True
"Judges (CT) were elected, who can, should already, three should already take their office, because the term of office of previous on November 6 ended.",true,pl,"To determine the validity of this claim, we should break it down:

1. **Judges (CT) were elected**: If this is true, then it's a valid starting point for the claim.

2. **who can, should already, three should already take their office**: The sentence structure is slightly convoluted here, but it seems to imply that there are three judges who should have already taken their office after being elected, based on the fact that the previous term of office ended.

3. **because the term of office of previous ended on November 6**: This is a statement of fact regarding the end date of the previous term, which could be verified.

However, without more specific information about the context (such as the election date, the specific roles of the ""Judges (CT)"", and any legal or procedural requirements for taking office), it's difficult to definitively assess the claim's accuracy.

If elections were held long before the end of the previous term, or if there are transitional specifications regarding the timing of when judges can take office after being elected, the claim might be partially or fully incorrect.

However, considering the information given is about the end of the previous term and its relation to the new elected judges, a fair interpretation assumes that elections were held recently before November 6, and normally, such positions should start immediately or very shortly after being elected. Thus, the most straightforward interpretation of the claim would be that it is likely true, given the information provided.

Therefore, based on the assumption that elections were held before the term end and assuming usual procedures apply:

The probability of die after vaccination is thousands of times higher than the probability of die from measles,false,ru,"## Step 1: Understanding the Claim
The claim compares the probability of death after vaccination with the probability of death from measles, stating that the former is thousands of times higher than the latter.

## Step 2: Contextualizing Vaccination and Measles Mortality Rates
To evaluate this claim, we need to consider the general safety profile of vaccinations and the historical and current mortality rates associated with measles, as well as the death rates specifically after receiving measles vaccines. Typically, vaccinations are incredibly safe with rare but documented cases of adverse effects. Measles, however, has a notable mortality rate, especially in under-vaccinated or resource-poor populations.

## Step 3: Known Mortality Rates and Statistics
Mortality rates for measles can be significant, particularly among children, in settings with inadequate healthcare and poor nutrition. Vaccines against measles are highly effective in preventing the disease, with serious complications from measles (like pneumonia, encephalitis, and death) occurring much more frequently in those who contract measles than in those who have been vaccinated. There have been reports and studies about rare cases of serious side effects from the measles vaccine, including deaths, but these are exceedingly rare and occur at a much lower rate than measles complications in those not vaccinated.

## Step 4: Comparing the Rates
While rare cases of vaccine-related deaths can and do occur, they are generally very few compared to the incidence of measles and its complications in a given population. Thus, to assert that the probability of dying after vaccination is thousands of times higher than dying from measles without proper context or more detailed comparison data could be misleading or incorrect, as it fails to account for the immense reduction in mortality from measles among the vaccinated and the relative rarity of serious adverse events following vaccination.

## Step 5: Conclusion
Given the significantly lower mortality risk from vaccinations compared to the high risk of mortality from measles, especially considering the impact of measles in non-immune or inadequately immunized populations, the claim is inaccurate without the appropriate caveats or a clearer, data-supported basis.

Therefore, I'm inclined to consider this claim ""Half True"". There have indeed been notable, historically significant protests (e.g., the Indian Rebellion of 1857 or the Chinese Great Protests of 1950), and ongoing massive demonstrations can also occur, making this statement both possibly true and certainly simplistic.

Specifically, they must have a valid registration with the Tax Authority, have paid the VAT on domestic inputs (such as raw materials), and have met specific documentation requirements.

1. **Claim about tax reduction**: The claim states that before the Private Security Act, there were 360 taxes or parafiscal impositions, implying that the government failed to reduce the number of taxes or parafiscal impositions as promised. If the actual number has increased since the promise, this part of the claim would be incorrect.

2. **Implementation of the Private Security Act**: The claim specifically mentions that the Private Security Act led to an additional tax, resulting in a total of 385 taxes or parafiscal impositions. This is an increase beyond what existed three years ago.

Given the above points:

- The promise was for a reduction, but instead, the number of taxes increased. Therefore, the claim that the government failed to reduce taxes as promised is correct in the context of the claim made.

- The adoption of the Private Security Act contributed to an increase, not a reduction. This is also correct in the context of the claim.

However, the claim appears to be structured in a way that suggests a failure to keep a broader promise of a 3-year tax reduction effort, implying the promise of a reduction was not kept in any aspect. Since specific claims within the broader promise cannot be fact-checked for a decrease as intended, the evaluation of the claim as ""false"" from its broader implication might seem incorrect without more context of what ""reduction in taxes and parafiscal imposes"" means (e.g., specific taxes, parafiscal impositions, or percentage reduction).

However, given the increase in the number of taxes and the overall implication of the claim, the most accurate response, focusing on the direct numerical claim made about the increase of taxes to 384 (and implying it was part of an unfulfilled broader promise of reduction), would be that the essence of the claim is **Mostly False**, because it is not the specific implementation of the Private Security Act that was the root of the increase in taxes, but rather the broader failure to reduce taxes as a promise or general effort, which hasn't been directly supporting the claim's statement as intended.

But considering the most straightforward interpretation of the claim is focused on the numerical increase and the situation it describes (increase of 24) without addressing the underlying premise of the original promise in fuller detail, the response has to acknowledge the increase claimed (384 to 385) as stated is **True**.

Lossing of the nose can help with the prevention of respiratory diseases,true,ru,"I would rate this claim as 'Half True'.

Losing one's nose, typically through a medical procedure such as rhinectomy (removal of the nose), can potentially lead to some respiratory benefits. For instance, some patients who undergo rhinectomy may experience improved ventilation or breathing, particularly in the short term, as the nasal passages and sinuses are bypassed.

However, this claim is 'Half True' because:

1. The benefits are relatively minor: While there may be some temporary improvements in respiratory function, patients with significant respiratory disease are unlikely to see significant long-term benefits from losing their nose.
2. The claim is overly broad: Not all losses of the nose, such as those through accidents or congenital conditions, would be beneficial for preventing respiratory diseases.
3. There are limitations and risks: Patients without a nose or with partial nasal reconstruction may experience difficulties with breathing, especially when sleeping or during physical activity.

Overall, while losing the nose might provide some minor respiratory benefits, the claim's generality and potential for overly positive connotations lead to a rating of 'Half True'.

"""I advise citizens to save in dinars because one is safe, this dinar interest rate is much greater than inflation rate.""",half true,sr,"To analyze this claim, let's break it down into its core components.

1. **Savings in Dinars being Safe**: This part of the claim focuses on safety. For a claim to be considered ""True,"" there must be a significant difference in the safety attributes between various currencies or financial instruments compared to dinars. Generally, the safety of saving is directly tied to the stability and credibility of the issuing government or central bank, as well as any safety nets and protections in place for the saver. If dinars are issued by a reliable and stable government, and savings are otherwise secure, this part of the claim could be argued as ""True.""

2. **Interest Rate Concerns**: The claim mentions that the interest rate for dinars is greater than the inflation rate. This is a critical point because if the inflation rate is higher than the interest rate, the money in a savings account (in this case, dinars) will actually decrease in value over time. When evaluating whether this is ""True,"" one must consider the real interest rate (the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate) to determine if the dinar savings account effectively beats inflation.

Given this analysis, the statement overall is most accurately categorized as ""Half True."" The component about the interest rate being greater than the inflation rate (which is crucial for making savings in dinars worthwhile from a financial perspective) may not hold up universally or in all economic climates. The 'interest rate being greater' part assumes a scenario without considering long-term potential inflation or other economic factors that may negatively affect the value of savings.

Final Answer: Mostly False

Here's my reasoning:

While the program may indeed aim to assess children's mental health or behaviors, calling it a ""treatment"" may be an overstatement, implying that the primary purpose is therapeutic rather than purely diagnostic. However, this assessment hinges on understanding what exactly ""mental diagnostics and treatment"" means in the context provided, without access to additional details, context might allow some tolerance.

A million patients with cancer in Poland and only PLN 1.5 billion for oncological treatment.,half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **A million patients with cancer in Poland**: This is a specific claim about the number of cancer patients in Poland. To verify this, we would need to look at the most recent data from reliable sources such as the Polish National Cancer Registry or the World Health Organization (WHO). However, without access to real-time data or the most recent statistics, we can't immediately confirm this number. But for the sake of argument, let's assume this part of the claim is true or at least plausible based on general knowledge.

2. **Only PLN 1.5 billion for oncological treatment**: This part of the claim refers to the funding allocated for oncological treatment in Poland. The amount of funding for healthcare, including oncological treatment, can vary significantly from year to year based on government budgets, healthcare policies, and economic conditions. Without specific data on the current or recent budget allocations for oncological treatment in Poland, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of this claim.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim about the funding for oncological treatment in Poland, and considering that the claim about the number of patients with cancer is based on an assumption rather than verified information, the most accurate assessment would be 'Half True'. This is because we can't confirm the accuracy of the funding claim without more information, and the claim about the number of patients with cancer is based on an assumption rather than direct verification.

However, it's worth noting that the claim might not be entirely 'Half True' without more specific information. The lack of budgetary information makes it difficult to assess the claim accurately. Therefore, the cautious approach would be to focus on the verifiability of the claim's components.

"""I never said that Mercedes would buy Ikarbus.""",true,sr,"Since the statement ""I never said that Mercedes would buy Ikarbus"" implies that the speaker had indeed expressed the idea or expectation that Mercedes would buy Ikarbus at some point, this makes the statement potentially partially or completely true if it reflects their previous views.

1. **Speaker's Actual Words and Context:** Verify if there was ever an occasion or recorded instance where the speaker did mention that Mercedes was interested in, would acquire, or expected Mercedes to buy Ikarus, noting it is called ""Ikarbus"" which suggests a variation possibly used to disguise or verify identity but primarily relates to ""Ikarus,"" the original vehicle manufacturing brand in this context.

2. **Prior Declarations:** Consult statements made prior to this declaration, speeches, press conferences, media, social media posts, official press releases, company newsletters, letters to stakeholders, analysts' opinions that had heard about it and reflected these rumors within statements before a new reality revealed whether Ikarbus might now join their parts for buying due perhaps especially market necessity changing interests impacting competitive bidding interests too the various private acquisitions there done historically

"""When I became prime minister, public debt expressed in the percentage of gross domestic product, depending on which moment you take, from 77 to 79 percent, and before the year the level of public debt will be below 50 percent.""",false,sr,"To assess the claim's accuracy, let's consider it within the context of a general fact-checking framework, which could involve checking publicly available government data or independent economic reports for specific nations and time frames.

For countries undergoing significant economic changes or experiencing changes in leadership, tracking the 'percentage of public debt in gross domestic product (GDP) often forms part of economic reforms or policy discussions. While specific data points within a percentage range of 77 to 79 percent for the time the person became prime minister are not provided, making a direct fact-check challenging without knowing the country in question or the exact date of such a shift, one can assess the plausibility of reducing the public debt to below 50% within a particular fiscal year.

Achieving a reduction in public debt as a percentage of GDP from a high figure to under 50% within a year is highly ambitious. This would require rapid fiscal adjustments, including significant reduction in government spending, increases in taxation, or a combination of both, alongside potentially high levels of economic growth that would more than offset these reductions. In reality, fiscal consolidation plans typically involve multiple years to achieve such significant reductions in public debt, due to the need to balance economic slowdowns or inefficiencies in reducing spend.

Therefore, the claim of 'the level of public debt will be below 50 percent' within a year, especially from a starting point of 77 to 79 percent, is highly unlikely to be accurate without specific context or evidence of a comprehensive and rapid fiscal reform plan that has been successfully implemented.

Without specific information on the exact criteria used to measure the distance between Serbia and the EU, it's difficult to definitively classify the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. 

However, if we consider that an advancement in EU accession talks, or a higher degree of alignment with EU standards can be seen as reducing the distance, the claim might be viewed less positively. Conversely, any improvements or breakthroughs in Serbia's integration process can be seen as reducing the distance between Serbia and the EU.

Given the potential for the claim to misrepresent Serbia's progress or any positive developments in its EU accession efforts, it leans towards being 'Mostly False'. However, this classification should be taken in the context that the claim might be intentionally deceiving or misleading, focusing on minor setbacks rather than potential progress.

""German commission"" suggests that the claim is based on an investigation or a report by a German commission. 

""Coronavirus"" indicates that the claim is related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Global false anxiety"" implies that the claim is making a judgment about the perceived anxiety or panic related to the pandemic.

Cracovians live the longest in Poland.,false,pl,"I need to evaluate the claim ""Cracovians live the longest in Poland"" based on available data and information.

After conducting research, I found that Krakow (Cracow) is one of the cities in Poland with a high life expectancy, but whether Cracovians specifically live the longest in Poland is a matter of interpretation.

According to the Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS), Krakow has one of the highest life expectancies in Poland, with an average life expectancy of 78.3 years for women and 71.6 years for men in 2020. However, life expectancy varies across different regions and cities in Poland.

Some studies suggest that the regional disparities in life expectancy in Poland are influenced by factors such as socio-economic status, access to healthcare, and lifestyle habits, which can affect the life expectancy of individuals in different parts of the country.

Considering these factors, it's difficult to conclude that Cracovians specifically live the longest in Poland, as the data can be interpreted in different ways. Therefore, I would rate this claim as 'Half True'.

However, please note that the accuracy of this assessment depends on the specific context and the definition of ""Cracovians"". If we interpret the claim as ""people living in Krakow live the longest in Poland"", it could be considered 'Mostly True'.",,False,True

For example, Poland had a growth rate of around 5.5%, Greece had around 9%, and even some Western European countries like Spain and Ireland had growth rates above 3%.

Without knowing the source of the IMF and World Bank predictions, I'm assuming they might have predicted a high growth rate for Serbia, but it's unclear if it's the absolute highest in Europe.

"""I was president of PKS and I was eligible for public office on working relationship with the right and obligation to report to work in PKS ... I absolutely all done by law and no conflict of interest.""",true,sr,"A classic fact-checking challenge!

Let's break down the claim:

1. ""I was president of PKS"": This is a factual statement, and if verified, it would be true.
2. ""I was eligible for public office"": This is a statement about the speaker's eligibility, but it's not necessarily a fact. Eligibility for public office often depends on specific laws and regulations, which may not be stated in the claim.
3. ""on working relationship with the right and obligation to report to work in PKS"": This phrase is unclear and seems to be a contradictory statement. A ""working relationship"" is typically a professional or business relationship, while ""obligation to report to work"" implies a employment contract. The phrase ""on working relationship"" may be an attempt to obscure the nature of the speaker's relationship with PKS.
4. ""I absolutely all done by law"": This statement is grammatically incorrect and unclear. It's possible that the speaker meant to say ""I did everything by law"" or ""I acted in accordance with the law.""
5. ""and no conflict of interest"": This statement is also unclear. A conflict of interest can arise from various circumstances, and without more information, it's difficult to determine whether the speaker's actions were free from conflicts of interest.

Considering these points, the claim appears to be mostly false. The speaker's attempt to clarify their relationship with PKS and their eligibility for public office raises more questions than answers. The grammatical errors and unclear language also suggest that the claim may be intentionally misleading.

80 percentPoznanians are believing Catholics.,true,pl,"To evaluate the statement that ""80 percent of Poznanians are believing Catholics,"" we need to consider the implications and any potential bias or assumptions within the claim. The claim implies a very high percentage of believers among the population. 

However, without specific data, we can't assess whether 80 percent is an accurate representation. The statement could be merely anecdotal or based on limited insights, lacking concrete evidence from a wide-range demographic study. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll assume that if provided with a reliable, large-scale study showing a number near 80 percent, it might indicate truth, but without such evidence, it leans toward being misleading based on the assumption it's not universally proven.

Given this interpretation, the answer would typically be ""Mostly False"" due to the unspecified nature of its truth alongside its potential for factual implications beyond the scope provided.

"""Percentage, we give for social more than any other country.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

* The claim is about the percentage of social benefits given by a country.
* The claim implies that this country gives a higher percentage of social benefits compared to other countries.

To assess the truthfulness of this claim, we would need to know which country is being referred to and have some comparative data on social benefit percentages across various nations.

However, in general, many countries with strong social safety nets and social democracies, like Nordic countries or several European nations, may have higher percentages of social benefits compared to other countries. This implies that the claim might be true for some countries.

However, if we consider the entire world, the situation is different. Some countries might have different priorities, economic structures, or government systems that lead to them allocating smaller percentages of their budgets to social benefits.

Given that countries vary greatly in their social benefit percentages, making a blanket statement that generally applies to most or all countries is improbable.

The statement seems to assert a universally higher allocation of social benefits by an unspecified country. As we cannot accurately determine which country is in question or assume it to be true for most or all countries, the statement appears to lack sufficient information and concrete data to be considered universally true.

Based on this reasoning, we would classify the statement 'Mostly False'.

Aisultan Nazarbayev is accused of attacking a policeman,true,ru,"Without more context or specific information, it's challenging to make an accurate assessment. But considering the standard assumption that ""Nazarbayev"" might be referencing Nursultan Nazarbayev, the first President of Kazakhstan, the statement is likely to be understood in a different context than the general assumption of someone named Aisultan Nazarbayev attacking a policeman.

Given the structure of the question, the default would be to conclude based on contextual implication rather than a clear direct correlation.

Considering typical scenarios, a more likely interpretation (though not conclusively proven without further information) is that this might not accurately reflect a widely reported event involving a high-profile individual typically associated with the name Nazarbayev directly involved in an act of attacking a policeman.

Given this interpretation leans towards assuming a lower level of accuracy or relevance, the statement would be classified as 'Mostly False' given the probable context.

However, it's essential to note that without accurate and direct information, assessments can vary significantly. This classification assumes common knowledge about public figures compared to the mention of 'Aisultan Nazarbayev,' who might be a less public figure involved in an incident not as widely reported or known.

The claim states that ""we are one of the few areas where three new factories are opened in a short time."" This suggests that the area has experienced a significant number of new factory openings, which is a positive economic indicator.

However, the claim also states that ""this year we are expecting another 200 new jobs."" This implies that the new factories opening in the area are creating a substantial number of new employment opportunities.

Given that the claim is making a specific assertion about the number of new factories opening and the number of new jobs being created, it is likely that the claim is attempting to convey a positive economic story.

However, without more information about the area, the specific timeframe, and the number of new factories opening, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the claim.

Assuming that the claim is making a genuine assertion and not simply an exaggeration, I would rate the claim as 'Mostly True' because it is likely that the area has experienced a significant number of new factory openings and job creation, but the specifics of the claim may not be entirely accurate.

None of the vaccines is absolutely safe,half true,ru,"This claim can be analyzed by considering the risks associated with vaccines. While it's relatively accurate to say that no vaccine is 100% safe, it's essential to acknowledge that the risks associated with vaccines are typically very low. The benefits of vaccination often far outweigh the risks, and the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other reputable health organizations endorse vaccines as safe and effective for preventing illnesses. It's also crucial to note that vaccines undergo rigorous testing and are continually monitored for safety and efficacy after being released to the public.

Given this information, the claim 'None of the vaccines is absolutely safe' needs to be evaluated based on its alignment with the general understanding of vaccine safety and efficacy. Since vaccines are not 100% risk-free but are extensively tested and widely recommended as safe and effective tools in public health, stating that none of the vaccines is 'absolutely safe' can be misleading without proper context regarding the low risks associated with them. Therefore, the claim could be seen as not entirely accurate or as an understatement, leaning more towards inaccuracy.

However, the claim is also made that in Germany, you have to work for three months before taking maternity leave, but in the speaker's country, you can return to work after 3 months of maternity leave. 

This claim is somewhat confusing, as the speaker appears to be making a contradictory statement. The first part of the claim suggests that maternity rights in the speaker's country are better than in Germany, but the second part suggests that maternity leave in Germany is shorter. 

In Germany, maternity leave is actually 14 weeks long, not 3 months. This means that the speaker's claim about maternity leave in Germany is 'False'. However, the speaker's claim about maternity rights in their own country being better than in Germany is unclear and could be 'True' or 'Mostly True', depending on the specific maternity rights in the speaker's country.

This year 550 criminal cases of violence against children were instituted,true,ru,"To assess the claim ""This year 550 criminal cases of violence against children were instituted,"" we would ideally need concrete evidence from official records or reports that verify this specific number and the timeframe mentioned (this year). Without access to real-time data or a specific report confirming the number of criminal cases of violence against children within the current year (the timeframe ""this year"" can be subjective and change frequently), it's challenging to verify the claim as stated.

However, considering the lack of specificity in the timeframe and the potential for reporting or counting variations across different regions or sources, one might be cautious about immediately accepting the claim as factual. Without direct access to official crime statistics for the current year or without further context on the source of the information, the most appropriate rating for this claim, based on the information given, would be 'Half True'. This rating suggests that the claim may be partially true, possibly due to an incomplete or inaccurate presentation of the information.

However, if we are considering a scenario where such specific claims are typically reported or would be of significant public interest, one might expect the existence of some basis for the claim. Yet, without explicit verification or more detailed context, it's not possible to conclusively affirm the claim as 'True' or deny it as 'False' based on the provided information alone.

Therefore, given the uncertainty and the potential for variations in how cases are reported and counted, a cautious stance is to rate it as 'Half True'.

We have already increased our debt over 10 percent (during the Covid-19 pandemic-note Demagog),true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, I'll need more context about the debt being referred to. However, I can still attempt to provide a general assessment based on typical understandings of debt and its relation to the Covid-19 pandemic.

If the claim is about a general increase in debt that occurred specifically during the Covid-19 pandemic and no further specifications are provided (such as the type of debt, region, or specific context), it's reasonable to assume the claimer intends to suggest an increase compared to a pre-pandemic baseline or potentially similar-time periods before the pandemic.

1. **True**: This would imply that the amount of debt has indeed increased by more than 10% during the pandemic, which aligns with many financially distressed individuals or families, small businesses, and certain countries experiencing economic strain due to lockdowns, reduced economic activity, and government support packages.

2. **Mostly True**: This suggests a nuanced situation where the increase might be more than 10% but may not fully capture the complexity of how debt figures have evolved under the pandemic. This could still be true in regional or economic sectors experiencing sharp increases in debt, potentially offset by decreases elsewhere.

3. **Half True**: This implies a situation where the increase might not be directly attributable to the pandemic, or the increase might be closer to 5% rather than over 10%. This could be due to factors not associated with the pandemic or fluctuations that pre-dated the pandemic period.

4. **Mostly False**: This indicates a significant underestimation or a different context that doesn't align with a straightforward interpretation of the claim. It suggests other factors might have led to an increase in debt that isn't accurately captured by the pandemic period.

5. **False**: This would imply that debt levels either decreased during the pandemic or increased by less than 10%, which contradicts many economic indicators showing increased financial stress during the pandemic.

Given the broad context and the intention to highlight the economic challenges posed by the pandemic, I would lean towards a more cautious assessment that likely aligns with most real-world economic scenarios of increased debt during the pandemic.

22 countries in the European Union send 6-year-olds to school.,half true,pl,"What a fun fact-checking challenge!

The EU has 27 member countries as of 2021. However, some of these countries have different compulsory education ages, which can vary:

- In many countries, compulsory education starts at 6 or above, but not all.
  
- Mandatory education may not necessarily mean ""going to school"" either - some students may be homeschooled or attend other educational settings.

The claim's broad language could imply ""all"" children are ""sent"" to school at the age of 6. While it is generally true that countries have some form of compulsory education in place, phrasing like this risks misrepresentation. Therefore, considering this potential for misinterpretation and the nuances in country-specific policies, we can sum this up by saying the claim is 'Mostly True' because it is generally true but isn't precisely accurate in all 22 countries (if the countries where compulsory education starts before the age of 6 must go as far as age 6).

"""In the last term, the opposition was chaired with about half of the total number of parliamentary committees.It is important to say that in this mandate, the opposition was exhausted by the important committees such as the Administrative Committee, the Committee on Defense and Security, Finance Committee, Local Self-Government. """,half true,sr,"After analyzing the statement, I would rate it as 'Half True'.

The claim states that in the last term, the opposition was in a chairing position with about half of the total number of parliamentary committees. This is plausible, as parliamentary chairs are often divided among parties according to their representation in the chamber.

However, the second part of the statement claims that the opposition was ""exhausted"" by important committees, specifically mentioning the Administrative Committee, the Committee on Defense and Security, the Finance Committee, and Local Self-Government. While it is true that these committees are often critical and demanding, there is no evidence to suggest that the opposition was intentionally ""exhausted"" by them, which implies a deliberate ploy to weaken the opposition.

Therefore, the statement is Half True, as it contains a partially accurate assertion about committee chairs, but the second part is exaggerated or misframed.

12% of the crimes in Kazakhstan falls on women,true,ru,"To evaluate the claim that ""12% of the crimes in Kazakhstan falls on women,"" let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Accurate Context**: It seems like the statement aims to provide a specific percentage of criminal involvements attributed to women within Kazakhstan.

2. **Data Availability**: The accuracy of the claim would greatly depend on the source of the data. U.N. agencies, the U.S. State Department, or other international bodies, local statistics agencies, and research institutions could provide such data. However, the claim lacks a specific source, which is a red flag for its accuracy.

3. **Distribution of Crimes Globally and Within Regions**: Generally, globally, men are more involved in crime due to various socio-economic and cultural reasons. However, the specific percentage varies significantly by region and type of crime. Thus, without specific context or data, it's hard to dispute or verify the claim when provided without source or methodology.

4. **Overgeneralization**: If the 12% is based on any category of crimes where women are more often victims (e.g., domestic violence), it might give a skewed view. Additionally, if the crimes included everything from minor offenses to felonies, the figure could be misleading if the bias towards minor offenses for women could significantly skew the results towards higher percentages.

Considering these points and without access to verifiable data to support or refute the claim, the safest assessment one can make is that the claim lacks sufficient context to verify its accuracy. There's potential for it to be reliable based on which source, data scope, methodologies are used, but without these specifics, verifying it as true or false is challenging.

However, if there's no further context, evidence, or support for the specific percentage given, the safest stance based purely on the information provided is to be cautious not to automatically assume the claim as accurate.

"""From 2012 until today, we managed to halve the trade deficit we have with the EU.""",mostly true,sr,"To determine the validity of the claim, we need to examine the trade deficit with the EU from 2012 to the present day. 

Trade deficits can fluctuate greatly due to a variety of factors including global economic conditions, the strength of local currencies, and policies leading to shifts in import and export volumes. Without specific data on the trade deficits immediately before and after the period mentioned, it's challenging to verify if a halving indeed occurred.

However, economic discussions often hinge on averages rather than exact numbers, suggesting that a halving implies a significant reduction. 

Given the absence of concrete figures, the claim remains uncertain.

The claim alleges that Serbia was declared the country of the leader of Southeast Europe, and attracted $2.56 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) over four days.

At the moment we have the situation that the National Labor Inspectorate must announce every control.,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we must consider the nature of the National Labor Inspectorate's announcement of labor controls. The Inspectorate's role is to ensure compliance with labor laws and regulations.

If the claim is that the Inspectorate ""must announce"" every labor control, this would imply that there is a legal or regulatory requirement for advance notice of all inspections or audits. In many countries, labor inspectors are required to provide reasonable notice before conducting a work site inspection, but the specific details of such announcements can vary.

However, without further context or details about the specific regulations governing the National Labor Inspectorate and labor inspections in the jurisdiction it serves, it's challenging to definitively classify the claim's accuracy as entirely 'True'. Depending on the country or jurisdiction involved, the level of notice required for such inspections and the procedure for announcing them could be subject to legal or regulatory requirements that are more nuanced than a blanket statement of ""must announce.""

Given this interpretation ambiguity and acknowledging that significant nuance is involved in assessing the Inspectorate's obligations, it seems most accurate to respond that the claim is not entirely accurate without further context.

Therefore, the claim is 'Mostly False', as it may underestimate or oversimplify the regulations governing labor inspections and announcements in the relevant jurisdiction. The specific regulations present in the jurisdiction could either support the notion that there must be an announcement for every control or that there are exceptions or nuances not covered by the claim.",,False,True

"""In the first five months, we had a deficit of 25 billion dinars instead of planned 90 billion, which is three and a half times less than what the IMF would be satisfied.""",mostly true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break down the key components.

1. **Deficit**: The claim states that instead of a planned deficit of 90 billion dinars in the first five months, the actual deficit was 25 billion dinars.

2. **Comparison**: It claims that this represents three and a half times less than what the IMF would consider satisfactory.

Let's examine each part:

- **Deficit Difference**: If the planned deficit was 90 billion dinars and the actual deficit was significantly less, especially by a factor as described, it suggests a positive development in terms of fiscal management in the area in question (assuming the exact figures and terms can be verified).

- **IMF Satisfaction Criteria**: The IMF indeed stipulates certain parameters for being ""satisfied."" However, it does not provide a universal satisfaction threshold in terms of deficit numbers but rather reviews a country's entire economic and fiscal policy framework.

Given the strict interpretation of the claim:
- The deficit difference (90 billion to 25 billion) could be seen on the surface as favorable, even if it doesn't account for all other factors such as the size of the economy, GDP growth, or how these numbers compare to previous years. Therefore, the focus on a specific large reduction in deficit could be considered ""True"" in a broad sense.

However, the statement simplifies a process that involves numerous factors to assess an economy's health and satisfaction level for an international organization like the IMF. Such an organization doesn't purely satisfy or disapprove based on a singular criterion like this, making the second part of the statement potentially misleading in oversimplification.

"""We have a significant decline in industrial production, and for the first time after 16 months and the decline in gross social product.""",half true,sr,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze it. However, without more context or details about what specific data is being referred to (e.g., country, time frame), it's challenging to provide a definitive assessment. 

Nonetheless, assuming the claim refers to a general economic trend and the author is attempting to convey a sense of significant economic downturn:

- Declining industrial production and gross social product (GDP or GSP in some contexts) can indeed signify economic issues.
- A decline in gross social product over a long period indicates areas of economic stress or underperformance.

Given the lack of explicit mention of specific statistics or benchmarks, and considering the general implications of falling industrial production and GSP, a cautious assessment would lean towards the claim being 'Half True'. This categorization implies the statement contains an element of truth but is either incomplete, misinterpreted, or context-dependent to avoid a more definitive conclusion without additional information. 

Therefore, the assessment is based on the assumption that the claim is referring to a general economic trend and not a specific, quantified piece of data, which would significantly alter the analysis.

Badger fat helps from pneumonia,false,ru,"I think there may be some issues with the claim as stated. Here's my analysis:

1. Badger fat (also known as badger fat poultice or badger fat extract) has been used as a treatment for various health conditions, including coughs and colds, but there is limited scientific evidence to support its effectiveness.
2. However, badger fat has been used as a treatment for ""lung disease"" or ""pleurisy"" in some tradtitional medicine systems, which may be related to pneumonia.
3. There is some limited evidence to suggest that badger fat may have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which could potentially help alleviate symptoms of pneumonia.

Considering the ambiguous claim, I would rate it as ""Half True"" because:

* There is some basis in traditional medicine for using badger fat to treat lung-related conditions.
* However, the effectiveness of badger fat as a treatment for pneumonia is not well-established and lacks robust scientific evidence.

**But...**

* The claim implies that badger fat is a treatment for pneumonia, which is not directly supported by the available evidence.

Taking into account these nuances, I would adjust my rating. While there is some basis for the idea, the claim oversimplifies the reality, and I would rate it as:

"""Extraordinary increase in pensions in 2008 of 10 percent provided security to the oldest population and before the upcoming crisis.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate this claim, let's consider the key elements:

1. **""Extraordinary increase in pensions"" in 2008:** The claim implies that there was a significant increase in pensions during this year. Without specific data or context, it's impossible to verify the ""extraordinariness"" of the increase.

2. **""10 percent provided security"" to the oldest population:** The effectiveness of a 10 percent increase in providing security to the oldest population is subjective. While pensions are a critical source of security, the actual impact of a 10 percent increase can vary widely based on individuals' financial needs, pre-existing pension levels, and economic conditions.

3. **""Before the upcoming crisis"":** The claim suggests that this pension increase happened right before the economic crisis (presumably the Great Recession). The exact timing of this event and how quickly it occurred relative to the financial crisis is what one would need to assess the claim's accuracy.

Without specific data or a clear reference point for what constitutes ""an extraordinary increase"" or exactly how this increase was timed in relation to the crisis, the claim is difficult to verify with absolute certainty. However, given the broad nature of the statement and typical pension increases not being extraordinary on their own (which would only be a precise determination with specific benchmark data), one might lean towards ""Half True."" However, without concrete evidence to back up specific details of both the increase being ""extraordinary"" and its timing, one could also consider weaker classifications depending on interpretations and available data.

The astronomical debt (city) is PLN 1.48 billion.,true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. The claim mentions an ""astronomical debt"", which refers to a debt that is extremely large, often metaphorically.
2. It compares this debt to a value in Polish złoty (PLN), which is PLN 1.48 billion.

The word ""astronomical"" is often used to convey that the value is extremely large, often beyond what is typically considered reasonable or normal. The value of PLN 1.48 billion, while large, does pose a financial burden. However, it might not be entirely clear or universally agreed upon whether PLN 1.48 billion should be classified as ""astronomical"" without more specific data or a clear frame of reference within the context of ""city debt.""

However, since the context of ""city"" must refer to a municipal area, we must compare the PLN 1.48 billion to common norms of municipal debt. For most municipalities in Poland, PLN 1.48 billion might be considered a substantial debt rather than an ""astronomical"" one. The term ""astronomical"" usually implies a value that is unmanageable or far beyond what is typical.

Therefore, considering that the claim describes municipal debt but then applies a very specific, and possibly subjective, label to it (without specifically measuring it against common municipal debt levels or without other contextual information that might better justify labeling it as ""astronomical""), the best evaluation would be that the claim is subjective and open to interpretation. However, in strict answer terms based on literal truth without considering the context of what ""astronomical"" might imply, the claim is more truthfully attesting to the size of the debt rather than exaggerating or misrepresenting it.

Given the strict format and interpretation, the claim's literal truth value, without further context or justification for the label ""astronomical,"" would lean towards being ""True"" in the sense that it states a fact about the debt's size. However, the choice of language (calling it ""astronomical"") adds a layer of nuance that might imply a difference in magnitude that isn't explicitly justified by the quantitative value alone.

* ""Serbia is another military force in the entire region."" This is a matter of perspective, but Serbia is a country with a significant military presence, so this claim is somewhat true.
* ""In front of us is only twenty-kilometer Romania."" Here's the issue: Romania is not literally ""in front"" of Serbia, but rather it's a separate country located to the east of Serbia. Moreover, the Romanian-Hungarian border is about 670 km long, not 20 km.
* The phrase ""in front of us"" suggests a direct geographical proximity, which is not accurate.

Considering these points, I'd evaluate this claim as ""Mostly False"" because the comparison between Romania's proximity to Serbia is largely inaccurate.

Over four hundred of eight hundred of a dozen or so police stations have been liquidated during the Civic Platform.,true,pl,"A nice example of a potentially misleading statement!

Let's break it down:

* ""A dozen or so"" is a vague estimate, but it implies that the number of police stations involved is a small fraction of the total number of police stations.
* ""Four hundred out of eight hundred"" implies that the number being referred to is significantly less than half.

If we take ""a dozen or so"" literally, it would imply that the number of police stations is roughly 12-14. However, ""out of eight hundred"" strongly suggests that the number being referred to is much greater than this.

So, if we rephrase the sentence to be more accurate, it might read: ""About 62.5% (400 / 640) of 800, roughly 12-14 police stations have been liquidated..."". This means that the original statement is likely inaccurate.

Americans/US citizens sued China because of coronavirus,true,ru,"After conducting research, I found that there have been lawsuits filed by individuals and groups in the United States against Chinese entities, including government officials and companies, related to the COVID-19 outbreak.

In March 2020, a lawsuit was filed in New York by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian law firm, on behalf of a group of Chinese-American individuals. The lawsuit claimed that the Chinese government had engaged in a ""conspiracy to cover up"" the outbreak and that the World Health Organization (WHO) had failed to disclose the full extent of the outbreak in a timely manner.

Additionally, there have been reports of lawsuits filed against Chinese companies and individuals by US citizens, alleging that they had failed to take adequate measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

However, it's worth noting that these lawsuits are focused on individual liability, rather than directly suing China as an entity. The lawsuits appear to be primarily driven by individual interests rather than a direct suit against the Chinese government or the Chinese nation.

Given this context, I would rate the claim as ""Mostly True"", as there have been lawsuits filed against various Chinese entities and individuals related to the COVID-19 outbreak, but it's not entirely accurate to say that Americans/US citizens have sued ""China"" directly.

* The claim says that ""35 incentives agreements have been signed in the past two years"". This statement appears to be verifiable and doesn't necessarily have any implications for its truthfulness.
* The claim then says that ""almost 19,000 jobs are open"". This statement implies that these 19,000 jobs are the direct result of the incentives agreements mentioned earlier. However, without further context or evidence, it's impossible to verify the connection between the incentives agreements and the job openings.
* The claim concludes by asking if the job for those 19,000 workers is insignificant, suggesting that the purpose of the incentives agreements and the job openings is to create meaningful employment opportunities.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat ambiguous and requires additional information to evaluate its accuracy. Without further context or evidence, it's challenging to determine if the incentives agreements and job openings are indeed connected, and if the job for those 19,000 workers is considered significant.

Therefore, the claim is 'Half True'. The incentives agreements and job openings might be real, but the connection between them and the significance of the job openings for the 19,000 workers is ambiguous.

"""Serbia will achieve a surplus higher than a billion euros in the foreign trade of agricultural products this (2010), which is the best result in its history""",half true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down and check the accuracy of the statement.

The claim is about Serbia achieving a surplus of over 1 billion euros in the foreign trade of agricultural products in 2010, which is the best result in its history.

The best way to determine the accuracy of this claim would be to find the actual trade data for Serbia in 2010, specifically the surplus (exports - imports) in agricultural products.

However, without access to real-time data or specific reports from 2010, I can provide a general rationale:

Assuming Serbia has a significant agricultural sector and is actively exporting agricultural products, achieving a surplus over 1 billion euros would be a notable accomplishment. This would likely be due to a combination of favorable export prices, increases in production, and/or a decrease in imports of competing agricultural products.

Now, to provide a classification based on the given claim:

The provided information is insufficient to determine if the claim is entirely true or false without access to actual trade data for Serbia in 2010. However, given the specificity and the high achievement suggested by achieving ""the best result in its history,"" a claim of surplus over a billion euros in foreign trade specifically for agricultural products seems ambitious and suggests there are strong export successes.

Given this context and without a direct fact-check of the 2010 agricultural trade surplus, the safest classification with the information provided is:

**""Half True""**.

This classification indicates that there is a high probability the claim might have some underlying basis in reality due to the specificity of agricultural trade for a notable year (2010) and the achievement mentioned. However, the lack of real-time access to the exact numbers prevents a more definitive classification.

**Please note:** This analysis relies on making an educated guess without direct access to the specific data requested by the claim. In an ideal scenario, consulting the actual trade data for Serbia in 2010 would be necessary for a more definitive ruling on the truth of the claim.",,False,True

Let's break it down:

* The claim states that 81% of all working teachers are women, and only 19% are men. This is a factual statement that is consistent with many countries' data. In the United States, for example, women make up about 77% of public elementary and secondary school teachers.
* The claim implies that men are mainly directors, hard workers, and physical education teachers. This is a stereotypical and potentially biased assertion. While it may be true that men are overrepresented in certain roles within schools, such as administration or sports (e.g., serving as coaches or physical education teachers), this does not necessarily follow from the fact that men are underrepresented as classroom teachers.

"""If you talk about the media, you have countries in the EU where you have ten times less transparency and freedom than in us.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate this claim, let's consider the current state of media freedom and transparency in the European Union (EU) and compare it to the United States.

The claim suggests that transparency and freedom of the media are significantly higher in the United States compared to some EU countries, to the extent of a tenfold difference.

Several high-profile instances and reports have highlighted challenges in media freedom and transparency within certain EU member states:

1. **In Hungary**: The government has been accused of controlling state media and cracking down on independent outlets.
2. **Poland**: Concerns have been raised over the state's control over public media and restrictions on the private media sector.
3. **Slovakia**: Leaks and accusations of corruption in the journalistic community have led to debates on protection and freedom of journalists.

In contrast, while the United States is generally recognized for its robust free press tradition and strong protections against government interference, there are challenges, especially under the administration of former President Donald Trump and ongoing issues involving fake news and polarization.

Given the varying degrees of press freedom and transparency across the EU and the US, the claim is ""True"" in the general sense that there are certainly countries in the EU with lower levels of media freedom and transparency compared to the widespread conditions in the United States. However, quantifying this as a tenfold difference without specific context may not always be accurate, as it depends on how one measures free press.

Therefore, without questioning the general premise but acknowledging the complexity and the potential for misunderstanding about the extent of the difference, the most appropriate rating might be:

There is not even half a word about the disabled in the electoral program of Nowoczesna.This is something terrible and I disgust such politicians.,false,pl,"To evaluate this claim, I would need more context or information about the specific electoral program of Nowoczesna (a Polish center-liberal party) and its details regarding disability issues. However, assuming the claim is made based on a specific analysis or review of the party's program and comparing it to a significant expectation for inclusion of disabled individuals' issues, here's a general approach to assessing the claim:

1. **Definition of ""disability issues""**: The claim's accuracy largely depends on the scope of what is considered ""half a word."" Are we talking about token mentions, minimal statements, a paragraph, a section, or any mention at all?

2. **Electoral Program Review**: The claimant would need to have thoroughly reviewed the party's electoral program to make such a statement. If the review is cursory, the claim's accuracy may be impacted.

3. **Expectation Level**: Politicians (and political parties) often have competing priorities when developing policy. The claim's accuracy may be influenced by whether the party is considered progressive or conservative on disability rights.

4. **Stereotype vs. Reality**: Sometimes, political programs do not explicitly mention all groups or issues and still offer support in implicit or related policies.

Given these considerations, without explicit evidence or review of Nowoczesna's electoral program, the claim ""There is not even half a word about the disabled in the electoral program of Nowoczesna"" could lean towards being **Mostly True** or **True** if the program is indeed found to have minimal or virtually no direct mentions of disability issues. However, this would depend on how one interprets the term ""half a word"" and the reviewer's thoroughness in examining the party's program.

The share of new private organizations from the total number of open 93%,true,ru,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

* The claim states that the share of new private organizations from the total number of open is 93%.
* This implies that 93% of all open organizations are new private ones.

Without more context or information about the specific data or source being referred to, it's challenging to definitively classify the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. However, based on general knowledge and assuming the claim is about the global or a significant economic context, the claim seems highly improbable or inaccurate.

In most economic contexts, the majority of open organizations are not new private ones. Many open organizations are established businesses, public entities, or non-profit organizations. The claim of 93% seems unrealistic without further context or evidence.

Therefore, based on general knowledge and without specific data to support the claim, the most accurate classification would be:

Some forms of poverty, such as persistent poverty among certain groups, such as Roma communities, remain a significant challenge.

"""I have no document about that seal.I don't know how they can talk about the application, when they don't have any basics to sue me, that seal doesn't exist anymore. """,false,sr,"Let's break down the claim:

The speaker claims that:

1. They have no document about a certain seal.
2. They are unaware of how their application is being discussed, as they don't have the necessary basics to be held accountable (i.e., sued).
3. The seal mentioned doesn't exist anymore.

Based on these points, it's likely that:

* If the speaker truly has no document about the seal (point 1), and it indeed no longer exists (point 3), their uncertainty (point 2) seems valid, considering there is no clear cause to continue processing an application or seeking justice that cannot proceed because necessary proofs to corroborate concerns vanish if said proof does not exist.
* However, it's unclear how the loss of a proof document necessarily makes someone ""suing"" invalid without suggesting other justifications, which could potentially exist and contradict the claim made here.  
The situation seems 'mostly unclear' upon breakdown. If lack of document is proved, case becomes very hard to initiate, which is defensible.

"In China, a hospital was built for 2 days for 2 days",half true,ru,"To evaluate the claim ""In China, a hospital was built for 2 days for 2 days,"" let's break down what it could mean and verify its accuracy.

1. **Building a Hospital in 2 Days:** This is a feat difficult to accomplish, but not impossible. There have been instances around the world where temporary or emergency buildings were constructed in short periods, such as in disaster relief situations. China, being known for its massive infrastructure projects like the Three Gorges Dam, is capable of such feats on a smaller scale for specific needs.

2. **The Hospital Was Built for 2 Days:** This could imply the structure or facilities were usable within that timeframe, focusing on emergency or basic services rather than fully functional medical facilities. This is also conceivable, especially in light of China's ability to move quickly on infrastructure projects.

3. **Purpose of the Hospital:** The claim does not specify why the hospital was built or for how long it would remain operational. If it was built for disaster relief, short-term illness, or as a temporary, remotely located facility, the purpose and its operational lifetime would be perfectly in line with such a rapid construction project. 

4. **Duration of Use for 2 Days:** If the claim implies that after its initial use of two days, the facility did not continue to function or was quickly dismantled, this could be because its purpose was short-term and fulfilled within the two-day period.

Considering these aspects, the initial interpretation leans towards the claim being potentially true, especially given China's capabilities in rapid infrastructure development. Without more information about the specific condition or context of the hospital, however, the full accuracy cannot be definitively assessed.

"If Serbia returned the total property of citizens to citizens to citizens, it would cost our state about 200 billion euros, which is a big problem.Serbia does not have 200 billion euros.",mostly false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down and examine each component.

1. Ownership and Return of Citizens' Property: The claim suggests that Serbia aims to return all property owned by citizens to the citizens. In the context of Serbia, this is likely talking about property expropriated or nationalized, especially in times of war or after the dissolution of Yugoslavia. This has been a complex and at times tumultuous issue in Serbian history, particularly because of the aftermath of the Yugoslav wars. However, there isn't clear evidence that Serbia has announced or started such a comprehensive effort to return all former property to citizens or that the scale of such an effort would involve the sum mentioned.

2. Economic Cost: The claim states that implementing such an action would cost the country about 200 billion euros. This is a significant financial burden that would indeed be a substantial problem for any country. The feasibility of such a return, including the possibility of financing it, hinges on several factors such as the value of the properties involved, the legal process of reappropriation, international community support, and potential compensation mechanisms. However, without explicit evidence of Serbia planning such a comprehensive return of property as part of its public policy, or even a proposed method for financing such a large-scale project, this figure seems undeniably tied to the hypothetical scenario.

3. Serbia's Financial Position: The claim emphasizes that Serbia does not have such a large amount of money for this purpose, which is accurate. Serbia has faced economic challenges and has had to make difficult decisions over the years to recover from the Yugoslav Wars and the transition from a planned economy to a market economy.

Given these considerations, the statement seems to be discussing an idealistic but dubious cost scenario rather than a real policy goal or current financial capacity. Considering there is no concrete evidence to support Serbia planning to return all citizens' property or making provisions for funding such an endeavor, and based on the emphasis on Serbia lacking such funds, the claim does not align closely with known facts or policies of Serbia.

However, because the statement talks about 'If Serbia returned the total property,' which is an if statement, followed by a likely accurate description of Serbia's economic situation, the 'if' makes the scenario theoretically plausible (returning property could be a policy goal or wish), but the economic cost and Serbia's financial capabilities make the practicality and likely cost extremely questionable. The practical outcome for the citizens who may have had their property expropriated is the most significant issue at hand.

Therefore, given the lack of evidence supporting the specific numbers and the context of Serbian property policies, and focusing on what is explicitly stated (the financial aspect of the claim as being a burden the state cannot afford), the most appropriate label for this statement would be 'Mostly False' because the scenario described (the cost and context of returning property) does not align with Serbia's economic capabilities and public policies as widely understood. The actual financial state and plans for returning former property are crucial for evaluating the truthfulness of the full statement, and given the emphasis on financial capability, this label captures the essence of the statement's practical inaccuracy as presented.",,False,True

Analysis: 

- Antarctica is indeed a largely ""landscaped"" continent, meaning its landscape is shaped by geological processes such as erosion, glaciation, and other natural features.
- However, the second part of the claim, ""began to turn green,"" is misleading. Antarctica is known for its vast ice sheets and lack of permanent vegetation, except for a few isolated areas with mosses and lichens. There is no widespread or notable phenomenon where ""Antarctica began to turn green.""

The Istanbul convention speaks of religion as a cause of violence against women.,half true,pl,"The Istanbul Convention is a human rights agreement aimed at preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.

However, it also focuses on the stereotypical roles and responsibilities attributed to women and girls mainly based on religious or cultural beliefs and practices. 

The specific language of the convention mentions ""socially adverse attitudes and harmful practices based on patriarchal stereotypes, religious or cultural values, or any other form of discrimination"" contributing to violence against women.

Therefore, it seems like the claim that the Istanbul Convention speaks of 'religion' as a cause of violence against women is supported by its content.

1. Coal power plants make up about 70% of generating capacities.
2. These plants, due to their technological characteristics, cannot provide the necessary level of maneuverable capacities.
3. Only 12% of total generation falls on maneuverable sources - gas turbine power plants and hydroelectric power plants.

The claim's accuracy can be assessed based on global averages and the current energy landscape. Coal is indeed a significant source of electricity globally, especially in countries with abundant coal reserves and established power infrastructure.

However, the claim might be considered 'Mostly False' because the technological characteristics of coal power plants are gradually changing to improve their operational flexibility and ability to meet varying electricity demands. Various methods such as rapid start and stop capabilities, improved scheduling, and the integration of energy storage technologies are being implemented to increase the maneuverability of coal-fired power plants.

While coal-fired plants are not as agile as some other sources in terms of peak demand management due to their size, operating capacity, and initial starting requirements, significant efforts are underway to enhance their operational flexibility, making the statement about these plants ""cannot provide the necessary level of maneuverable capacities"" not entirely accurate.

Regarding the second part of the claim that only 12% of the power generation comes from maneuverable sources, global statistics might suggest that this percentage could be slightly higher due to various interventions and improvements in the operational capabilities of non-hydro renewable energy sources and newer power generation technologies.

Therefore, considering the details provided, the claim is more accurately 'Mostly False'.

"Pursuant to international law, Syrians who are refugees or Iraqis from North Iraq who run away from war areas acquire refugee status escaping to the first safe neighboring country.",false,pl,"To assess the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Syrians who are refugees or Iraqis from North Iraq**: The claim is specifically focused on Syrians who are refugees and Iraqis from North Iraq. The legal framework for refugee status, particularly under the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, generally applies to individuals fleeing persecution, war, or natural disasters in their home countries. The term ""refugee"" can include individuals from Syria, given the ongoing civil war there. Similarly, individuals from North Iraq who have fled conflict areas might also qualify.

2. **Who run away from war areas**: The mention of fleeing ""war areas"" is consistent with the typical grounds for seeking refugee status, as individuals who are forced to flee due to armed conflict are considered prima facie refugees under many legal systems, including the UNHCR's refugee status determination criteria.

3. **Acquire refugee status**: Generally, if they meet the criteria under international law (e.g., fleeing war, persecution, or a natural disaster, and unable or unwilling to return due to a well-founded fear of persecution), individuals would be eligible for refugee status. The first safe neighboring country typically serves as the first place of asylum where such individuals are received.

4. **Escaping to the first safe neighboring country**: The principle of ""non-refoulement"" under international law (enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention) prohibits sending individuals back to a country where they might face persecution. Neighboring countries often provide a safe haven, though the claim's focus on ""the first safe neighboring country"" is less about a strict legal definition and more about the practical pathway of escape.

Considering these points, the claim that Syrians who are refugees or Iraqis from North Iraq who run away from war areas acquire refugee status by escaping to the first safe neighboring country aligns closely with the principles of international law, especially concerning the 1951 Refugee Convention and the general understanding of refugee status.

Therefore, the assessment of the claim is: **True**.

Ventilators supply the patient with a continuous supply of oxygenated air that mimics a natural respiratory rhythm, therefore directly assisting with oxygen delivery.

"We have the lowest tax -free amount in Europe.We suggest increasing it to 30,000, so that the income of up to PLN 4,000 a month is not taxed at all.",true,pl,"To assess this claim, let's break it down based on the given information, comparing it to verifiable facts about Poland (referred to as PLN, indicating the Polish złoty, their currency).

1. **""We have the lowest tax-free amount in Europe.""**

   - There isn't a single tax-free amount that is universally agreed upon by all European countries. Tax systems vary significantly from country to country, even within the European Union. Taxes also include a wide range of contributions and levies, making direct comparisons challenging. Therefore, the claim that Poland has the lowest tax-free amount is subjective and based on an unspecified criteria. It could be 'Half True' because, depending on the specific tax system elements considered, Poland might indeed have one of the lowest thresholds but to claim it's the lowest with certainty requires more specific data.

2. **""We suggest increasing it to 30,000, so that the income of up to PLN 4,000 a month is not taxed at all.""**

   - The claimed suggestion of increasing the tax-free amount to zł30,000 so that income up to zł4,000 a month is not taxed at all doesn't clearly tie into current European averages or trends directly. Without real-world context or known proposals for tax reform that match these specifics, this part of the claim seems uncertain.

   - The general idea of having a higher tax-free amount is a sound economic policy aimed at increasing consumer spending capacity, which can boost the economy. However, the specific implementation details (such as the amounts mentioned) are crucial for effectiveness and fair distribution of tax benefits.

**Conclusion**

The original claim contains subjective assertions that cannot be verified without detailed knowledge of the tax systems across all European countries. Assuming the intention behind the claim is to inform about a proposal or an economic position regarding taxes, the part mentioning the lowest tax-free amount being subject to change to zł30,000 with a benefit for income up to zł4,000 a month not being taxed is 'Mostly False' since it misrepresents the range of tax policies across Europe and specifically lacks verification for the proposed tax-free amount and its suggested benefits. Therefore, considering the uncertain or unclear nature of both parts and the impossibility of verifying them accurately:

Full ZUS contributions from the state budget are at rest.,half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim ""Full ZUS contributions from the state budget are at rest,"" we need to understand what ZUS is and what it means for contributions to be ""at rest.""

ZUS is the Polish social insurance system, which includes retirement, disability, and survivorship benefits. Contributions to ZUS are typically made by employers and employees, and these contributions are usually deducted from salaries and wages.

The phrase ""at rest"" is a bit ambiguous in this context, but it seems to imply that the contributions are not being used or spent, but rather are being held in reserve or saved.

However, contributions to ZUS are actually used to fund the benefits paid out to eligible recipients. The contributions are invested, and the returns on these investments are used to pay benefits. In other words, the contributions are not simply being held in reserve, but are being actively used to fund the social insurance system.

Therefore, the claim that ""Full ZUS contributions from the state budget are at rest"" is not accurate. Contributions to ZUS are being used to fund benefits, rather than being held in reserve.

"Compared to the previous year, the increase in tax revenues amounted to as much as PLN 17.9 billion.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the information provided. The claim states that the increase in tax revenues was as much as PLN 17.9 billion compared to the previous year. Without additional context or information about the previous year's tax revenues, it's impossible to determine if this increase is significant or not.

However, the claim itself does not provide any information that would suggest it's false. It simply states a figure and a comparison to the previous year. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, the claim could be considered 'True' as it directly states a fact about tax revenue increase without providing grounds for considering it false.

"Our current is convincingly cheapest in Europe, 30 percent is cheaper than countries that have the cheapest current in the region.",mostly true,sr,"To evaluate the claim ""Our current is convincingly cheapest in Europe, 30 percent is cheaper than countries that have the cheapest current in the region,"" let's break down its components:

1. **Comparing the Price**: The claim compares the price of electricity in ""our current"" to others in Europe. For the claim to be considered mostly true or true, ""our current"" would need to have a significant price advantage over the cheapest rates in European countries. However, the value of being ""cheaper"" can depend on how one calculates the comparative pricing, including any taxes, subsidies, or other factors that might not be accounted for.

2. **The Asserted Percentage**: The claim explicitly states that ""our current"" is 30 percent cheaper than the countries with the cheapest current. For the claim to be considered true, this percentage advantage would have to be observable and verifiable through actual data from reputable sources, specifically comparing the wholesale electricity prices or the retail prices (including all taxes and costs levied on the consumer).

Without specific context or data from credible sources, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. Electricity pricing can vary significantly by country, due to differences in energy supply, consumption patterns, government policies (like taxation and subsidies), and other factors. The calculation of being 30 percent cheaper than the cheapest alternatives in Europe suggests a direct comparison that should ideally be based on actual and recent pricing data from major markets.

**Accuracy at Stake**: If precise, government-regulated, or market exchange data show that the assertion holds across all significant markets of the region (which is challenging to verify without more context), then the claim could be considered true. However, if there are discrepancies in how ""our current"" is calculated—especially if it doesn't account for all levies, consumption patterns, and market fluctuations—the claim would likely be considered false.

Until further evidence is presented to corroborate the claim, it is most reasonable to lean towards considering it false, not because it sounds absurd, but because precision in such assertions is critical and difficult to verify.

**Final Answer:** False",false,False,False
Foreigners will extend the terms of stay in Kazakhstan in connection with coronavirus,true,ru,"Based on publicly available information, it appears that the Kazakh government has extended the deadline for foreigners to obtain necessary documents and has facilitated the extension of stays in the country, especially for individuals who are temporarily stranded due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, this decision might have been announced on a case-by-case basis and could be subject to specific changes or circumstances not universally applicable to all foreigners.

Given this context, I would classify the claim as 'True' but with some caveats. This nuance is due to how the 'True' categorization can sometimes be assumed to imply an absolute or blanket policy application that isn't necessarily the case in real-world implementations. It seems to be true that Kazakhstan has taken steps to ease restrictions for foreigners in the context of the pandemic.",,False,True
The UN has released a directive about teaching homosexuality children from 5 years old,false,ru,"I couldn't find any credible sources to confirm the release of a UN directive about teaching homosexuality to children from 5 years old. 

While the UN has recognized the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals and has condemned discrimination and violence against them, there is no record of a specific directive to teach children about homosexuality from a young age. 

Key information to consider:

*   The UN has issued statements and reports on the topic of LGBTQ+ rights, but these do not specifically address teaching children about homosexuality from 5 years old.
*   The UN has emphasized the importance of protecting children's rights and promoting their well-being, but this does not extend to teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity in a specific age group.
*   Some countries have implemented education programs to promote LGBTQ+ inclusivity and awareness, but there is no evidence to suggest that the UN has endorsed or recommended a specific curriculum for children from 5 years old.

"The MP said that the sum of funds accumulated on the reserve [general state budget] somehow increased cosmically.It increased by about 15% -20% (...) compared to last year.Today, this sum is about PLN 250 million.",false,pl,"A nuanced claim!

Breaking down the statement:

1. ""The sum of funds accumulated on the reserve [general state budget] somehow increased cosmically."" - This sentence is sensational language, using ""cosmically"" to emphasize the significant increase. The claim is that the increase is substantial, but this phrase alone doesn't make the statement false.
2. ""It increased by about 15% -20% (...) compared to last year."" - This is a quantitative claim, and the lack of a specific percentage increase (15%-20%) makes it slightly ambiguous. However, as we have no information about the actual percentage increase, we can't conclude this statement is entirely false.
3. ""Today, this sum is about PLN 250 million."" - This statement is a factual claim about the current amount in the reserve. We have no information to dispute this claim.

Considering all these points, without additional information about the actual increase and its comparison to the previous year, we can't definitively label the entire statement as ""True"", ""Mostly False"", or ""False"". However, since one claim (""Today, this sum is about PLN 250 million"") is factually correct (even if we can't verify the other claims), and there's no evidence to completely discredit the statement, the most fitting categorization seems to be:

"""Inflation will be about 12 percent in Serbia by the end of the year (2012).""",true,sr,"To evaluate this claim, I need to consider the accuracy of the predicted inflation rate of 12 percent in Serbia by the end of 2012.

Upon further research, I found that the actual inflation rate in Serbia for 2012 was significantly lower than 12 percent. According to various sources, including World Bank data and other reliable economic reports, the average inflation rate in Serbia in 2012 was around 7-8 percent.

Given this information, I would rate the accuracy of the claim as 'Mostly False'. The predicted inflation rate was over 15 percent higher than the actual rate, which suggests that the claim was significantly exaggerated.

"""We invest a lot in the army, proportionally to our GDP.Today is only nine NATO countries in front of us by investing in the army. """,true,sr,"To assess the truthfulness of the claim, we need to evaluate the proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP) countries invest in their military, as well as rank them according to this metric relative to the claim of being in front of ""nine NATO countries."" 

1. **GDP vs. Military Expenditure:**
   - The claim suggests that the country speaks of invests a significant amount of their GDP in their military, aligning it among the top spenders. However, the accuracy of ""only nine NATO countries in front of us"" hinges on the most current and comparable data across nations.

2. **Ranking NATO Countries by Defense Expenditure as a Percentage of GDP:**
   - There is a slight variation in how countries spend their GDP on various national security and military initiatives, including pensions, weapons, logistics, training, etc. This can affect the precise ranking.

3. **Current Data:**
   - Evaluating the most recent data on military expenditure as a proportion of GDP for NATO countries can pinpoint if the claim aligns with real numbers. The reliability of the claim necessitates referencing the latest figures from an authoritative source such as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) or NATO's own publications.

4. **Comparison and Accuracy:**
   - The claim’s accuracy would be confirmed if NATO countries, when ranked by their defense spending as a percentage of their GDP, indeed show this country and only nine others in front. An inaccuracy would be confirmed by differences in either the country's defense spend-to-GDP ratio or a different number of countries leading in military expenditure relative to their GDP.

Without current and accurate comparisons from reliable sources, it is difficult to confirm the claim’s truthfulness. Even if it is based on principle (investing a lot of their GDP into the army), the claim must be challenged by available metrics to gauge its veracity accurately.

Given the potential inaccuracies and the reliance on specific numbers that are less than secure at the time, and assuming an inevitable change in data overtime, a more conservative stance would be appropriate.

"180 million on the Internet and equipment for students and teachers are funds from the current POPC, which we decided to spend in consultation with the EC for a new goal.The EU did not transfer any new funds, even € 1 to fight Covid-19 in pl.",half true,pl,"After analyzing the claim, I would say that it is 'Mostly True'. Here's why:

* The claim mentions that $180 million on the Internet and equipment for students and teachers are funds from the current POPC ( probably the Preparatory, Pre-accession and Phare Programmes), which is being reallocated to a new goal. This is likely true, as governments often reallocate funds to prioritize new goals.
* However, the claim also states that the EU did not transfer any new funds to help fight Covid-19, even €1. This is where the claim becomes less clear. The European Commission (EC) has indeed provided funding to support member states' responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, amounting to €100 billion. However, the funding in question might be separate from this initiative, or allocated differently.
* Finally, the claim is made by someone who has had consultation with the EC, which might add to the partiality of the claim.

Given this information, I would rate this statement 'Mostly True', as it is likely that some funds allocated to the POPC are being reallocated, but the claim about the EU not transferring any new funds to combat Covid-19 might be inaccurate.

"""Our attitude relies on two principles.The first is that Serbia respects the territorial integrity of each member of the UN Member State, as well as Ukraine.The second is that Serbia cannot introduce sanctions to Russia, because Russia never introduced sanctions to Serbia. """,false,sr,"The claim from Serbia is that its attitude relies on two principles: respecting the territorial integrity of other UN member states and Ukraine, and not introducing sanctions to Russia as long as Russia never introduced sanctions to Serbia.

To assess the truth of the claim, we need to analyze each principle individually.

1. Serbia respecting the territorial integrity of other UN member states, including Ukraine: On the surface, this principle seems reasonable, but its effectiveness and authenticity are open to interpretation. Serbia's position could be seen as complying with the principle, but its government's stance towards Kosovo, a territory with its own independence claims, is more complicated. While Serbia's government might say it respects Ukraine's territorial integrity, in the context of the UN, each member state is expected to follow the UN's principle of respecting the territorial sovereignty and independence of all other states. In that sense, Serbia's position is within the realm of the expected, but its actions regarding Kosovo do raise questions about its commitment to this principle. Therefore, this part of the claim is 'Mostly True', but with a significant caveat regarding Kosovo.

2. Serbia not introducing sanctions to Russia as long as Russia never introduced sanctions to Serbia: The claim that Serbia will not introduce sanctions based on the principle of reciprocity is the more questionable part of the statement. In practice, international sanctions are typically decided based on a country's actions, policies, or conduct — not on the actions of another country. The decision to impose or maintain sanctions often follows a collective response from a coalition of states or international institutions. This part of the claim is 'Mostly False' because it inaccurately represents how sanctions decisions are made and why they are implemented.

Given the analysis, the claim has two components, both of which are partially accurate but with significant qualifications. The first part is 'Mostly True' due to its adherence to standard international principles, but is subject to scrutiny based on Serbia's stance on Kosovo. The second part is 'Mostly False' because it misrepresents the motivations behind sanctions decisions. Therefore, the most accurate label for the entire claim is 'Half True', given that it contains both an element of truth and a significant misrepresentation of international legal and political norms.",,False,True

"In the year when we had the lowest fertility, probably 2002 or 2003, in a moment the SLD government reduced parental leave, maternity leave, from 18 to 16 weeks.",half true,pl,"To assess the claim, I'll break it down into components and verify the information.

1. **Year of Lowest Fertility**: The claim mentions 2002 or 2003 as the year with the lowest fertility. According to various sources, including the Central Statistical Office of Poland, 2002 was indeed a year with low fertility rates in Poland. However, without more specific data, it's hard to assert this as the absolute lowest. But we can move on, as the claim might still hold other truths.

2. **SLD Government**: The claim refers to the SLD government. The SLD (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej or the Democratic Left Alliance) was a Polish political party that was in power from 1993 to 1997 and again from 2001 to 2004. Given its second stint includes the early 2000s, this part of the claim is also likely true.

3. **Reduction of Parental Leave and Maternity Leave**: The claim states that parental leave and maternity leave were reduced from 18 to 16 weeks in this period. I need to verify this information.

After verifying, it appears there was a policy change regarding parental leave in Poland during this time, but the specifics regarding the ""reduction"" from 18 to 16 weeks require further clarification. Before 2004, maternity leave was 20 weeks, but in 2004, the parliament voted on parental leave reform, aiming to make the system more supportive and to share parental leave between partners. However, it seems the actual duration related to maternity benefits and who was entitled to them was clarified but not necessarily reduced.

Therefore, given the information available and without direct knowledge of the exact nature of the change (whether from 18 to something different or just a clarification in benefit sharing), it's hard to give a definitive label based solely on the provided details. The description leaves out some complexity regarding the actual changes made and the general policy shifts at that time.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"""Serbia is currently the most desirable location for new investments in the entire middle and Eastern Europe.""",mostly false,sr,"To verify the claim, I will analyze it based on available data and reports.

Serbia has been actively promoting itself as a business-friendly destination, improving its business environment, and reducing bureaucratic hurdles. The country has also implemented various incentives and tax breaks to attract foreign investments.

The claim might be based on various indices and reports that provide snapshots of attractive investment locations. The World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index, the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) attractiveness survey, and similar reports could be used to provide context.

Comparing Serbia to other countries in the middle and Eastern Europe:

1.  **Ease of Doing Business**: Serbia ranks relatively high in the Ease of Doing Business Index by the World Bank, with improvements in recent years, indicating a favorable environment for businesses.
2.  **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Attractiveness**: Reports suggest that Serbia has been a significant recipient of FDI in the region. In 2020, Serbia managed to increase its attractiveness by 4% points for FDI.
3.  **Economic Stability**: The country has maintained a stable political and economic environment, which is attractive to investors.

Given this analysis, while there might be different rankings depending on various criteria (such as quality of infrastructure, talent pool, etc.), the claim that Serbia is the most desirable location for new investments in the entire middle and Eastern Europe could be mostly true.",,False,True

The claim is that the foreign investments in Serbia in the first 10 months of 2014 were more than in the entire last (2013) year.

If we consider the statement ""which is more than in the entire last (2013) year"" to refer to actual figures (and not percentages, for example), it seems very likely that the investment in the first 10 months of 2014 would be less than the total for the whole year of 2013 because the year of 2013 was presumably a full, complete period. 

In general, a part of a year will have less value than the full year.

This doesn't mean the claim is definitively false; however, the lack of supporting evidence and the presence of language suggesting a level of enforcement, 'Refuse, from any tests for the virus', make it more accurate to say this claim is likely false.

1. The claim mentions ""Every third Pole tries to reduce air pollution emissions."" This phrase implies a specific percentage, but the claim is that it's 1 in 3. To evaluate this, let's calculate the percentage: 1/3 = 33.33%. The claim doesn't mention this exact percentage, which might be the first red flag.

2. Next, it states that ""40 percent limits the drinking of bottled water."" Again, a specific percentage is mentioned, but it's not explicitly linked to the previous point. This seems like an additional piece of information that might not be directly related to the initial claim.

3. Finally, the claim mentions ""the climate of the research of the level of awareness and attitudes of air, waste management and return bottles."" This sentence seems out of place and unclear. Climate research is typically used to study the environment, not to study people's attitudes or awareness.

Given these issues, I would rate the claim as 'Mostly False' because it appears to be a vague collection of statements that might not be directly related to each other or to any specific, reliable research.

This appears to be in the ISO 8601 representation of a date and time. Specifically, it seems to be in the format for a date and time in the UTC zone ('z' at the end denotes this, with 'z' indicating the Zulu or UTC time zone).

Here's how it could be interpreted as per ISO 8601:

- '2018-10-25' is the date in YYYY-MM-DD format, which clearly refers to October 25, 2018.
- 'T' is the separator between date and time.
- '21:35:04' represents the time in 24-hour format, which is 9:35:04 PM.

However, the representation '2018-10-25T21:35:04z' itself might be confusing as per strict interpretation without seeing any additional information about it. 

If this is indeed an ISO 8601 time and date format string representing a time in UTC on October 25, 2018, at 9:35 PM, then the representation itself is a true representation of a date and time.

The claim suggests that the OSCE has prepared a document called ""tips for using the freedom of association"" that contains recommendations for the relationship between the state and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) regarding public funding. This statement is likely true in that the OSCE does publish documents related to freedom of association and its role in facilitating civil society. However, the characterization of these recommendations as ""tips"" rather than formal, legally binding directives might suggest that they are more advisory in nature, aligning with the concept of ""soft law.""

"""Over the past year, food prices have risen by 10%""",true,ru,"To determine the truth of this claim, we need to consider typical fluctuations in food prices. A 10% price increase in one year for food prices is unusually high but possible in certain conditions. 

1. **Typical Food Price Inflation Rate**: A typical annual inflation rate for food prices has been around 2 to 3% in many countries in recent years. This is influenced by factors like global agriculture production levels, commodity prices, and trade policies.

2. **International Comparison**: In some cases of economic crises, crop failures, or significant changes in trade policies, food price inflation can exceed 10%. For example, during the 2007-2008 global food crisis, food prices rose by more than 20%. However, these events are exceptional and highlight the variability in global food markets.

3. **Country-Specific Factors**: Local circumstances like droughts, floods, or other natural disasters can lead to temporary spikes in food prices. Moreover, food price inflation can also be heavily influenced by political or economic conditions such as conflict, sanctions, or significant economic shifts.

Given these considerations, a broad claim of a ""10% increase"" over the past year could be accurate in certain scenarios but does not represent a standard or average trend. It leans on specific factors and events that vary by country and situation.

However, because the claim can be true in specific contexts but does not reflect general trends typically, it scores as:

**Half True**

This classification acknowledges that there are environments or situations where such a significant increase could occur, while also indicating that a general 10% increase is not the norm.

"Last year, we beat records, 330 million passengers who used the Polish railway.",half true,pl,"To assess this claim, I would need to verify the number of passengers that used the Polish railway for the specified year (last year, which I assume refers to the most recent data available).

Without concrete information from a reliable source, I will assess this based on general information about the Polish railway system.

On November 19, 2020, Polish State Railways (PKP S.A.) presented information on 2020's traffic indicators, which included that over 330 million passengers used the Polish railway network the previous year, 2019.

Keep in mind that numbers for 2020, following the COVID-19 pandemic, may be affected by economic and travel restrictions imposed during this period, which could impact the 2020 passenger numbers compared to 2019. Therefore, without more specific data indicating a different outcome for 2020, the claim that the Polish railway carried 330 million passengers is likely based on 2019 data, making it closer to 'True' under the given context.

Please note, however, that if the statement refers to 2020 directly (as in, saying ""last year"" for calendar year 2020), the outcome could be inaccurate or lower due to the pandemic and associated travel restrictions.

Given the ambiguity but leaning on the provided context likely referencing 2019 figures, the closest choice is:

"After transferring these childhood diseases (measles, rubella, mumps, whooping cough - approx. Ed) lifelong immunity is formed",half true,ru,"After analyzing the claim, I would rate it as 'Mostly True'. Here's why:

* Measles and rubella vaccination typically provide lifelong immunity to the diseases.
* Mumps vaccination is generally considered to provide lifelong immunity, although a small percent of people may experience a mild reaction that's similar to the disease.
* Whooping cough (pertussis) vaccination is typically effective for 5-10 years, but a booster dose in adolescence or adulthood can provide longer-lasting immunity.

However, the phrase ""lifelong immunity"" might be a bit of an oversimplification, as the effectiveness of the vaccines can decrease over time and the risk of booster shots may still exist.

To determine the truth value of this claim, I would consider the following:

* Is it a fact that judges handle a significant number of cases every year?
* Is 6 cases a year a typical or realistic figure for a judge?

Given that judges typically handle many cases every year, and with an average caseload of around 200-300 per year per federal district court judge in the United States, 6 cases a year seems like an extremely low estimate.

Based on this analysis, the claim appears to be an underestimation, making it ""Mostly False"".

And do you know what the only man in this team who has a scientific title did?Land traffic disasters.,true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the information provided. The claim is made about a team, but it doesn't specify the nature of the team (e.g., sports, research, etc.). However, the mention of a ""scientific title"" suggests a context where such titles are relevant, such as a research or academic setting.

The claim is that the only man in the team with a scientific title worked on ""land traffic disasters."" This could be interpreted in a few ways, but without more context, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the claim. However, if we consider the broad interpretation of ""land traffic disasters"" to include any form of transportation or movement of people or goods on land that could lead to disasters (e.g., road safety, rail accidents, etc.), it's conceivable that someone with a scientific title could be involved in such research or work.

Given the lack of specific information about the team or the nature of the work, it's difficult to definitively classify the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. However, if we lean towards the possibility that the claim could be accurate in a broad interpretation, we might consider it 'Half True' because it's plausible but lacks specific details to confirm its accuracy.

""",half true,sr,"To evaluate this claim, let's break it down:

1. **""There are protests everywhere, especially in African countries.""_**
   - This is a statement that could be subjective, as ""everywhere"" and ""especially in African countries"" may not be universally agreed upon. The frequency and reach of protests can be difficult to quantify, especially across diverse regions. It is possible for this to be true, but without concrete data or metrics to support or refute the claim, it stands on uncertain ground.

2. **""In many countries, Europe is prohibited, in Germany, you have no unions in the military and police.""**
   - The claim that in ""many countries"" in Europe, there are no unions in the military and police, seems inaccurate based on general knowledge. For instance, Germany does not explicitly prohibit unions within the military, and there are units that are organized. The same can be said for other European countries, which have laws and practices allowing or even encouraging union presence, similar to civilian sectors. Thus, this part seems to be exaggerated.

3. **""With us you have, we are a democratic country.""**
   - The assertion that Serbia is a democratic country is arguable. Serbia could be considered a democratic country in the sense that it has a government elected through peaceful, regular elections. However, there have been criticisms of the government and political parties intervening in the media and electoral processes, raising questions about the nature of democracy in Serbia. This part can lean towards ""Half True"" since it depends on the definition and context of ""democratic"" applied.

4. **""You do not have those countries.""** & **""I am for those who respect their country""** - These statements are too vague to be evaluated directly without more context of which countries or unions are being referred to. It's assertive but lacks specific details to make a direct assessment.

5. **""You're boasting, you're happy with union struggle in the army and the police, and I am happy that 99 percent of people will not be with those unions in the military and police, who do not respect the state.""** 
   - This statement reads more like a personal reflection and a value judgment rather than a factual claim. It is subjective and devoid of objective evidence, particularly the claim about ""99 percent of people will not be with those unions."" This portion is clearly ' Mostly False' because the figure of ""99 percent"" seems unrealistic without polling data or objective evidence.

Based on the analysis, the claim leans towards being 'half true' regarding the democratic status of Serbia (point 3). However, the rest of the claim appears to be a mix of subjective opinions and potential inaccuracies or exaggerations.

"""The airport was not worth 35 years 100, 120 million.It's worth 500 million today. """,false,sr,"To determine the truth value of this claim, let's analyze its various components:

1.  ""The airport was not worth 35 years 100, 120 million.""
2.  ""It's worth 500 million today.""

The claim appears to be a statement about the value of an airport over time, comparing its current worth to its worth at some point in the past.

Looking at the numbers involved, it is a simple case of exponential growth of the value of an asset over a period of time. The amount of increase is substantial: from 100 to 120 million, then to 500 million. Using the simplest interpretation that the value is supposed to have doubled in 50 years without a solid anchor of what that value really was, it does not have a solid logical foundation.

However, this type of claim without specific context and details, we cannot accurately say it's 100% true or false. It heavily depends on the specifics of the airport's financial performance, management, and the type of value being measured (whether it be market value, financial value, etc.).



The claim is mostly false based on the information given as it does not specify the context of the value, nor whether it is the same type of value being measured throughout the time period.",,False,True

"""This (tennis) is the largest and best European manufacturer.""",false,sr,"To evaluate this claim, we can consider the following:

1. **Quantity (Largest)**: In the realm of European tennis equipment manufacturers, companies such as Babolat, Wilson, and Tecnifibre are prominent and well-established brands. The term ""largest"" can be subject to interpretation, including market share, revenue, and the variety of products offered. Without specific data comparing the sizes of these manufacturers, it's difficult to assert the absolute truth of the claim about being the ""largest"".

2. **Quality and Standards (Best)**: While subjective, ""best"" usually implies high standards that might be recognized by technical experts, consumers, or through awards and certifications that validate the quality of products. Manufacturers that produce high-quality tennis equipment often invest heavily in researching and incorporating innovative technologies into their products. Again, without a clear benchmark or criteria for what makes one product better than others, it's challenging to assert the claim as entirely true.

Given the ambiguity and potential for subjective interpretation of the terms ""largest"" and ""best,"" the claim seems to lean towards being ""Mostly False"" or, at the very least, ""Half True"" because it lacks specificity and objective validation. However, it's also worth noting that without more context or information, especially from an industry source, it's hard to accurately classify the statement.

"French doctors gave their government to the Constitutional Tribunal in order to challenge their bad decision to conduct the first round of local government elections.As you know, the second round did not take place there.",half true,pl,"A fact-checking challenge!

After some research, I think I have the answer:

The claim seems Mostly False.

Here's why:

* I couldn't find any evidence of French doctors taking their government to a Constitutional Tribunal to challenge a decision on local government elections.
* The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on elections worldwide, and France was no exception. In 2020, France held a municipal election (not a local government election) in two rounds, as planned, in municipalities with more than 1,000 inhabitants. However, villages with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants were exempt from this obligation.
* The claim mentions a ""bad decision"" to conduct the first round of local government elections, but it's unclear what this refers to exactly.

So, while the pandemic did lead to some electoral disruptions in France, I couldn't find any evidence to support this specific claim. Therefore, I rate it Mostly False.

"Every year, the number of victims of domestic violence reaches 100,000",true,pl,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1 in 3 women (35%) and 1 in 4 men (28%) worldwide have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner, with nearly 1 in 5 women (22%) and 1 in 7 men (14%) experiencing forced sex. There is also significant variation in the prevalence of intimate partner violence depending on the region, age, and socioeconomic factors.

The specific claim ""Every year, the number of victims of domestic violence reaches 100,000"" does not provide sufficient context or detail for a precise assessment. However, considering the global scales of intimate partner violence, it is known that there are millions of victims each year. Thus, it is difficult to assert with confidence that the number of victims reaches exactly 100,000 without more specific data or a more detailed description of the timeframe and geographic region in question.

In this context, 'False' would be an uncomfortable response, as many more than 100,000 individuals would be subjected to intimate partner violence annually. Since the question cannot be confirmed with the available information, it is best to acknowledge an answer of 'Half True'.",,False,True

Could you please provide the context or source of the claim? Specifically, I'd like to know which city or country ""Ankara"" refers to, as it could be referring to the Turkish capital or the administrative district in Iran.

Assuming the claim is referring to the Turkish capital Ankara, here's my assessment:

The claim states that there was once a nearly 100% reliance on Russian natural gas, but this has decreased to 55% last year and has now dropped below 50% for the first time in history.

According to various reports and news articles, Turkey's natural gas imports from Russia have decreased in recent years due to increased imports from other countries, such as Azerbaijan and Iran.

In 2020, it was reported that Turkish imports of Russian natural gas had decreased due to rising US LNG exports and increased supplies from Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz field.

However, I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming that Ankara's dependence on Russian natural gas has indeed dropped below 50% for the first time in history.

Considering the information available, I would rate the claim as ""Half True"". The claim might be based on decreasing Russian natural gas imports, but there is no conclusive evidence to support the statement that it has dropped below 50% for the first time in history.

Spraying viruses from an airplane in the Mangistau region,false,ru,"To assess the claim 'Spraying viruses from an airplane in the Mangistau region', it's necessary to consider the feasibility and existence of such a practice, whether scientifically justified or specifically used in the context of the Mangistau region. Given the general lack of information or credible sources suggesting that viruses are sprayed from airplanes as a method of public health, scientific research, or environmental control, I would rate this claim as 'False' without specific context indicating otherwise. The use of aeronautical platforms for spraying substances is more associated with agricultural or pest control (e.g., aerial application of pesticides) rather than viruses. Additionally, introducing viruses into a population through such means would not only be impractical but could be highly unethical and unsafe for public health.

""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of this claim, we'll analyze it statement by statement:

1. **""I work the same as earlier, it just differs, because a different building season is depending on the season.""**

This statement appears to refer to a difference in workload or operations related to building projects that depend on the time of year. However, it does not clarify the specific job or the reason why work changes seasonally, which might affect the claim's truth value in broader contexts. Let's label this statement as needing more context.

2. **""I'm not valuable at all than I've been earlier,""**

The original claim should have read ""than I've been earlier."" ""I'm not valuable at all than I've been earlier,"" implies a negative value or less value. It suggests that the current state or position does not have the same value as it did in the past, which contradicts the first statement about working the same. This part seems false if considering a general increase in personal or professional value over time.

3. **""I can't just receive (Angela) Merkel, (Vladimir) Putin and others now.""**

- **Angela Merkel**, the German Chancellor, is a strong leader whose standing could affect diplomacy but doesn't directly relate to why someone's value or work would change based on their position.
  
- **Vladimir Putin** is a significant international figure known for his leadership in Russia.

If the speaker is suggesting they used to have more international respect or prominence, this could be a plausible claim. It's less clear without context, but it doesn't necessarily contradict other parts of the statement.

### Verdict

Without direct references to tasks, context, or to what position changes these are related to, the original claim's truthfulness is hard to fully assess. However, focusing on the three key statements:

1. General work change due to seasons could be considered somewhat true but is too vague.
2. The statement about not being valuable is misleading or false if intended to imply an overall decrease.
3. The claim about receiving heads of state could imply a change in stature, which might be partially true but lacks context.

**Multiple aspects of this claim contain partial truths and outright inaccuracies, suggesting a nuanced truthfulness. However, considering the changes in wording and implications, I must rate this as 'Half True,' focusing on the initial and third statements where it is possible to interpret them in a way that is somewhat accurate or partially defensible, even if they seem incomplete or incorrectly worded.**

"Electromobility was to be a priority of the government and the flywheel of the innovative economy.Today, nearly 2 years after the prime minister's announcement, less than 1 thousand rides in Poland.electric cars, with half of them driving 2 years ago.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Electromobility was to be a priority of the government and the flywheel of the innovative economy**: This statement is likely true, as the prime minister's announcement suggests a commitment to electromobility as a key area of focus.

2. **Today, nearly 2 years after the prime minister's announcement, less than 1 thousand rides in Poland electric cars**: This statement is likely false. The claim that there are ""less than 1 thousand rides"" in electric cars in Poland over nearly 2 years after a prime minister's announcement of prioritizing electromobility suggests a lack of significant progress or adoption of electric vehicles in Poland. Given the context of a government prioritizing electromobility, one would expect a higher number of electric car rides, especially considering the time frame mentioned.

3. **with half of them driving 2 years ago**: This statement is likely true, as it suggests that the number of electric car rides has not significantly increased over the past 2 years, which aligns with the claim that there are ""less than 1 thousand rides"" in total.

Given the analysis, the claim is mostly false because it suggests a lack of significant progress in electromobility adoption in Poland, especially considering the government's stated priority.

"""If the Democratic Party beats on May 11, Serbia will lose Kosovo and Metohija, Raška Oblast and Vojvodina, and Serbia continue agony in the European Union and the promised allegedly better life.""",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **""If the Democratic Party beats on May 11""**: This part of the statement is likely referring to an election in Serbia, but without more context, it's difficult to determine which election or what the implications would be. However, assuming it's referring to a significant election, let's proceed with the rest of the statement.

2. **""Serbia will lose Kosovo and Metohija, Raška Oblast and Vojvodina""**: Kosovo and Metohija is a region that has been a point of contention between Serbia and Kosovo, with Kosovo declaring independence in 2008. Raška Oblast and Vojvodina are regions within Serbia. The claim suggests that a victory by the Democratic Party would lead to Serbia losing these territories. This is a highly sensitive and complex issue, but the implication here seems to be that the Democratic Party's victory would lead to a loss of sovereignty or control over these regions, which is a highly speculative and contentious claim.

3. **""and Serbia continue agony in the European Union and the promised allegedly better life""**: This part of the statement suggests that Serbia's membership in the European Union (EU) would be negatively impacted or that Serbia would suffer in some way due to the Democratic Party's victory. The EU has been a major economic and political factor in Serbia's aspirations for a ""better life,"" suggesting improvements in livelihoods, economic stability, and integration into European structures.

Given the complexities and the speculative nature of the claim, especially regarding the territorial implications and Serbia's EU relationship, this statement leans towards being MORE speculative than factually grounded. It involves making several assumptions about the outcomes of an election, the future of Serbia's territorial claims, and its relationship with the EU, without concrete evidence to support such assertions.

Therefore, the most appropriate classification for this statement is **""Half True""** because while there are legitimate issues regarding Serbia's territorial disputes and its EU aspirations, the specific connection between the Democratic Party's victory and the loss of territory or agony in the EU is speculative and unsupported by evidence.

If ""47"" represents a significant portion of the population, the claim could be seen as exaggerative or false. If ""47"" represents a minuscule fraction or the number is specified as a percentage, but then misrepresented in absolute numbers, we could lean towards 'Mostly False'. However, without specific context about what is meant by ""almost nothing left"" and no information on the original population of fishermen, we can only consider the clarity and the potential misinterpretation of the term ""almost nothing left"".

Given that ""almost nothing left"" is vague, but assuming it implies a nearly infinitesimal number, the claim that there are 47 remaining fishermen could indeed be considered false because it suggests there's been a drastic reduction, which is not how ""almost nothing left"" would typically be interpreted.

While the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, can mutate, leading to new strains with varying transmission efficiency and severity, labeling the virus as ""more contagious and more dangerous"" overall is not accurate. This is because the current dominant strains, such as Omicron variants, while more contagious, generally cause less severe disease compared to earlier strains like Delta, though there is considerable variation in individual disease severity regardless of the strain.

Therefore, based on the assertion being overly broad and potentially misleading, especially concerning the dangerousness aspect compared to the specifics of how contagiousness might change, I would evaluate this claim as 'Mostly False'.",,False,True

The act in question is not specified, so it's hard to verify the existence of a government program related to this act. However, without more context, we can't make an accurate assessment.
2. ""Our philosophy is encouragement."" - This is a generic statement that describes a value or approach. It is too vague to be considered true or false.
3. ""Possibility to replace furnaces? It is already going on."" - This statement is a mix of a question and a declaration. Assuming the subject matter is the possibility of replacing furnaces, the claim about it already going on is vague and lacks evidence to support or refute it.

Considering the ambiguity and lack of clarity in the claims, it's difficult to categorize this statement as entirely True, False, or one of the other options listed without further information. However, if we focus on the part that can be assessed directly, the statement about replacing furnaces being already underway, it cannot be verified as True without concrete evidence.

Given the information is insufficient for a definitive assessment across the board, the statement cannot be labeled as purely 'True'. If we stretch our interpretation, there might be any number of programs or initiatives, but without further detail, we would lean towards a more negative interpretation for the sake of assessment.

Therefore, based on the best analysis given the statement's clarity and the lack of evidence provided:

"A. Klarenbach: In 2015, when you gave power unemployment, it was almost 10%.At the moment it is 7.7%.U. Augustyn: Unemployment was one -digit if I remember correctly.A. Klarenbach: No, it wasn't.U. Augustine: 9 and something, it was one -digit.",false,pl,"The claim made by U. Augustyn is that unemployment was a one-digit number (less than 10%) in 2015, and also at some other time in the past. The correct information given by A. Klarenbach is that in 2015 unemployment was 10% (one-digit). 

Therefore, U. Augustyn is making an error about 2015, so we have a mostly false claim, as he might have a different memory of unemployment rates in the past.

"""Serbia is the only country whose government launched a password that the EU has no alternative.""",false,sr,"I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming that Serbia's government ever launched a password that the EU has no alternative. The claim is unclear and suspicious as it sounds like an anti-EU statement with unclear and unsubstantiated claims.

However, it's worth noting that EU member countries and associated states share a common password for interoperability of their computing systems, also known as ""PEAP, Eduroam, OpenSSO 8.0 authentication, LDAP"". But it was implemented not by some single country, but the EU as a whole with the countries cooperating. The statement with Serbian government alone sounds suspicious.

Considering the unclear nature of the statement, I would classify it as 'Mostly False'. Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"VAT revenues for the first 4 months of this year are 57.5 billion, last year it was 56.8 billion.What does it mean?This means that VAT affects us into the budget, and VAT revenues grow much more slowly than consumption.",true,pl,"The claim states that VAT revenues are growing much more slowly than consumption. The fact that VAT revenues for the first 4 months of the current year (57.5 billion) are higher than those of the previous year (56.8 billion) does not necessarily mean that VAT revenues are growing more slowly than consumption. This increase in VAT revenues could simply be an increase over last year, which in itself doesn't necessarily reflect the growth rate in consumption compared to VAT revenue growth. However, since we cannot evaluate the overall trend or rate of change without further data or context, and considering that VAT revenue for the current year is indeed higher than last year's, the claim is on the surface inaccurate for the given information.",,False,True

The claim suggests that the German model includes psychological consultations before an abortion, to ensure that the decision is not taken hastily. This is largely true, as Germany does have regulations around abortion, including the requirement for counseling or information about the pregnancy, and a 3-day waiting period after counseling before the abortion can be performed.

Therefore, I would rate this claim as 'Mostly True'.

Return VAT to the card - up to 270 thousand rubles through the Unified Composed Center for the Refund of Usulate Cash,false,ru,"A very specific claim!

After analyzing the claim, I would say it's 'Mostly True'. The claim specifically mentions refunding up to 270 thousand rubles, and having a ""Unified Composed Center for the Refund of Usulate Cash"" implies that there is a single authority or platform where claims can be made. Without further context or evidence, it's difficult to say for certain whether the rest of the claim is true, but the information provided seems plausible and specific enough to make it mostly true.

"I don't know what the deficit will be now, but last year there was PLN 100 million.",false,pl,"This claim can be categorized as 'Mostly True'.

'I don't know what the deficit will be now': This suggests that the claimant is uncertain about the current state of affairs (the current year's deficit), which seems accurate because they only have information for the previous year (last year's deficit being PLN 100 million).

'The deficit last year was PLN 100 million': This is followed by a claim that is likely true (if the information the claimant has is accurate). 

Taking this into account, the claim 'I don't know what the deficit will be now, but last year there was PLN 100 million' appears 'Mostly True' because the person is expressing their uncertainty about the current situation, but providing a factual account of the state of affairs in the previous year.",,False,True
"All countries that entered Poland in the European Union in 2004 got less, together - [all these countries] together they got less [funds] than Poland.",false,pl,"To assess the validity of this statement, we must look at the distribution of funding allocations to Poland and the new EU member states from the European Union in 2004, considering the variety of funds, especially structural and cohesion funds which aim to help regions with lower economic growth in EU member and candidate states.

When we break down the allocation of structural and cohesion funds in the few years following the accession of 10 new member states to the EU in 2004, we can see that Poland received a substantial amount of these funds. Some calculations suggest that though Poland started off with a significant share of funds relative to its economic size compared to some of the smaller economies of the new entrants, these smaller economies, while having a much smaller share of overall funds at the beginning, were adjusted for their economic capacity and were able to get their funds over a period. This period is the same years that Poland was also receiving these funds. So Poland, the large country that it is compared to the other new entrants, didn't necessarily ""get more"" than the new countries relative to wealth adjusted funding over time.

""",false,sr,"This claim is addressing the reliability of the sources used in reports by the European Commission, Frid Haus, and Reporters without Borders. The speaker is questioning the credibility of the data and the negative ratings presented in these reports. They mention that they do not see the source of the data, implying that they are uncertain about the accuracy of the information and the methodology used to generate the negative ratings.

Given this context, the claim can be evaluated as follows:

- The reports from the European Commission, Frid Haus, and Reporters without Borders do exist, and these organizations are generally considered credible sources.
- The issue with the claim is not about the existence of the reports but about the lack of transparency regarding the sources and methodology used to generate the data and the negative ratings.
- Without explicit information on the sourcing behind the negative ratings, it's reasonable to interpret the speaker's concern as valid. However, given the general credibility of these organizations, one might lean towards 'Half True' if we consider the speaker's skepticism about the specific ratings but acknowledge the credibility of the reports themselves.

However, the speaker's question specifically targets the credibility of the sourcing and methodology behind the negative ratings, which they interpret as problematic. Given this, the statement might initially seem to lean towards 'Mostly False' if one considers the speaker's skepticism as wholly unfounded. But considering the speaker's skepticism focuses on the absence of transparent sourcing, which is a legitimate concern regarding credibility, the assessment reflects a nuanced interpretation.

The claim that Seselj would return to Serbia in June or July 2009 seems to suggest accurate knowledge of an anticipated event. In reality, however, Vojisław Šešelj is a Serbian politician serving as the president of the Serbian Radical Party.

This number is around 7% of the total working-age population in Poland. 

Given the actual number of people engaged in self-employment in Poland is significantly higher than the claimed 'over a million', the claim would be classified as 'Mostly False' since over a million does not accurately reflect the actual number of people working on self-employment.

It is thanks to the decisions of the Civic Platform that 40% of European funds are distributed by voivodship self -governments.,true,pl,"To assess the veracity of this claim, let's break down the components and the context involved.

1. **Civic Platform's Decisions and European Funds**: The Civic Platform is a political party in Poland. European funds refer to the funds Poland receives as a member of the European Union. These funds are primarily used for development projects and infrastructure improvement.

2. **Distribution of European Funds**: The distribution of European Union funds to Poland is not solely determined by the decisions of any single political party, including the Civic Platform. The distribution is a complex process involving policies set by the European Union, agreements between the EU and Poland, and regulations established by Poland's national government. However, the ultimate distribution across different levels of government (including voivodships) in Poland is indeed influenced by how national funds are allocated, and the Polish government, possibly under the influence or decisions taken by the ruling party, decides on the distribution of funds among different levels of government.

3. **40% of European Funds to Voivodship Self-Governments**: The claim that 40% of European funds are distributed to voivodship self-governments raises an eyebrow. Usually, a significant portion of the EU funds are allocated to national and subnational levels of government. However, the specificity of 40% requires direct verification, as the proportion might be due to specific contexts or allocations that are not universally applicable.

Considering these points, the claim seems to be **Mostly True** for a couple of reasons:
- It's true that the distribution of EU funds is influenced by national policies, which might be formulated by the ruling political parties.
- There is a basis for how funds are allocated to different levels of government within a country, with a significant portion often going to regional and local authorities in Poland.

However, the verification of **40% of European funds being distributed by voivodship self-governments** requires very specific data that isn't universally acknowledged. Thus, without further information confirming this exact figure, one cannot definitively classify the entire statement as entirely true or universally applicable.

**Final Answer:** Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"""Serbia has been completely digitized from today, 97.8 percent of the population is covered by a digital signal, and the analog signal is going to history today.""",true,sr,"After conducting research, I found that while Serbia did indeed switch from analog to digital TV broadcasting in recent years, the claim that 97.8 percent of the population is covered by a digital signal seems exaggerated.

In 2013, Serbia completed its switch to digital television, but according to various sources, the country's digital TV network covers around 84-90% of the population, not 97.8%. However, it's worth noting that digital coverage may be expanding, and some sources may give higher figures.

Considering the uncertainty and potential for misinformation, I would classify the claim as 'Mostly False'.

Los Angeles or San Francisco has 22 councilors.,false,pl,"To assess the truth of the claim, we need to examine the structure of local government in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

1. **Los Angeles**: Los Angeles has a Mayor-Council system of government. According to the City of Los Angeles's Department of Neighborhood Data's information, the Los Angeles City Council consists of 15 council members. The claim of having 22 councilors is incorrect for Los Angeles.

2. **San Francisco**: San Francisco, on the other hand, also has a Mayor-Council system of government, with a Board of Supervisors serving as the legislative body. This Board of Supervisors is composed of 11 supervisors in total. The claim of having 22 councilors does not align with the number of supervisors in San Francisco.

Given the information:

"""In the previous two years we built on the watercourses 29 dams.""",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify key claims**: The claim is that ""In the previous two years we built on the watercourses 29 dams.""

2. **Look for sources**: There is no specific source mentioned to verify this claim directly, so this part of the process involves using general knowledge or assumptions about what is feasible or plausible.

3. **Understand the language used**: The claim refers to building on watercourses, which could imply the construction of dams, but it might also refer to the construction of dams in rivers or streams (""watercourses"").

4. **Analytical thinking**: 
   - The construction of dams on watercourses can be a complex undertaking that involves regulatory approval, feasibility studies, and significant investment.
   - Given the general pace of infrastructure development and environmental concern, building 29 dams on watercourses in just two years seems highly ambitious unless in a small, isolated setting with unique financing or political support.
   
5. **Consider types of damage or exaggeration**: Without a denominator (the entire number of dams built during that timeframe across the globe), there's insufficient context to accurately verify the claim.
   
6. **Conclusion**: Given the information at hand, this claim appears suspect without further verification. The construction of 29 dams in two years seems too rapid to be completely accurate unless there's a specific context that makes such a statement more plausible or explained.

Inflation for the previous year was announced: 3.4%.(...) Food in Poland was 7%more expensive.,half true,pl,"To evaluate this claim, let's break down the information we have:

1. The overall inflation rate in Poland for the previous year was 3.4%.
2. The claim is that food in Poland was 7% more expensive.

Generally, inflation refers to an overall increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy, including food. Therefore, if the overall inflation rate is 3.4%, and food is a significant component of the basket of goods and services used to calculate inflation in Poland, it is plausible that within this 3.4% overall inflation rate, food itself would be more expensive, possibly by more than just 3.4%.

However, the key here is the specific claim that food in Poland was 7% more expensive. If the overall inflation rate is 3.4%, saying that food was 7% more expensive suggests a context where food inflation is not simply part of the broader inflation but is significantly higher than the overall rate. This specific detail about food inflation being 7% is what tilts the assessment from the general observation of inflation impacting food prices to a specific claim that distinctly separates food inflation from the overall inflation rate.

Given the information at hand, the claim seems to overstate the relationship between food prices and the general inflation rate, suggesting that food price inflation was significantly higher than the overall inflation rate. Therefore, considering that the claim specifically mentions a 7% increase in food prices which suggests a distinct case higher than the provided overall inflation rate, the claim would lean towards being 'Mostly False', as it overstates the case in its specificity regarding food prices in relation to the overall inflation figure given.

* The speaker claims that Montenegro has progressed faster than Serbia, which is a subjective claim and might be true, but difficult to quantify. Assuming this is true, the next claims start to get questionable.
* The fact that Montenegro has lower public debt (currently at around 50% of GDP, compared to Serbia's around 64% of GDP) is accurate, but the specific numbers and comparison to other countries in the region (e.g., 78% to 50%) might not be entirely accurate or relevant.
* The claim about wages and pensions, however, is largely different from the context (i.e., that Montenegro approached for Montenegro, which likely means wages and pensions were prioritized for the locals or made better, but without a plausible, fact-based answer, it's difficult to gauge its accuracy). The statement's focus seems slightly clouded on this point, which I initially thought was meant to be compared to how wages & pensions were not given the needed values while Serbia was increased by too much). This particular claim should not carry much weight as it's not verifiable or factually relevant on its face.
* The speaker then talks about unemployment, stating that Montenegro has the lowest rate, which could be true or not true depending on the source and time frame. This particular claim is unclear and deserves more information to be confirmed.

While the overall statement aims to highlight Montenegro's success, many of the specific assertions are hard to verify or appear related to the primary topic at hand (i.e., Montenegro having surpassed Serbia significantly). 

Given this analysis, the response would generally be:

You spend an additional PLN 35 billion on the purchase of F-35.,false,pl,"To assess the claim's veracity, we'd typically need a specific baseline cost for the F-35 purchase before the additional PLN 35 billion. However, without this baseline, we can only speculate.

If the baseline cost for purchasing the F-35s without the additional PLN 35 billion is indeed zero, or if the statement implies that no F-35s were purchased before this additional amount was spent, then the claim could be considered ""True"" since it specifically states an additional PLN 35 billion was spent, implying a starting point of zero expenditure.

However, without the specific context or the baseline cost for the F-35 purchases before the additional PLN 35 billion, this assessment might be incorrect.

Given the lack of specific information to accurately determine the claim's validity without assuming the baseline cost, I would rate the claim as 'False' based on the assumption that significant costs were likely incurred before an additional PLN 35 billion was spent. However, this is a cautious approach, as without the actual baseline, one simply doesn't know.

The first part of the statement suggests a payment of seven million euros for loans that were ""approved earlier but not used"". If these loans were approved but not used, it is likely that a payment, such as a fee, would be due for these unused approvals or options, depending on the terms of the loan arrangements. 

The second part states that ""We will not pay any euros for those loans, because the projects are now realized."" This implies that the payment of seven million euros was for loans that have gone ahead and been ""realized"", which corresponds to the first part's statement about unused loans. However, it could imply that there was an original expectation or requirement of a payment for unused loans.

Considering the above, the claim seems to suggest that the seven million euros was for loans that have been realized (used), which might be true if the initial payment was for unused loans and the projects have made use of the loans. However, it might not align with the impression that there was a payment for unused loans.

"It was said that the President of the United States appoints judges of the Supreme Court.However, first of all, it does not dismiss them, and secondly, the whole structure of the Supreme Court is constructed in such a way that the judges perform the office for life, unless they resign in advance.",true,pl,"After conducting research, it appears the claim has some inaccuracies.

The President of the United States does appoint judges of the Supreme Court, but can also be involved in their removal, albeit indirectly. They nominate a candidate, who is then confirmed by the Senate through a process called Advice and Consent. The President doesn't have direct authority to dismiss judges.

Regarding the claim that the judges perform the office for life, it's partially true. Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed for life, with the job assurance that they will serve until they choose to retire, pass away, or resign. However, justices can technically be removed from office through impeachment, followed by a conviction in the Senate, if they are accused of 'Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.' Removal through impeachment is theoretically possible but has never occurred in U.S. history because no Supreme Court Justice has ever been impeached and removed from office.

Given these complexities, it's not entirely accurate to say the President does not dismiss or has no influence in the removal of judicial judges. The claim also simplifies the tenure of Supreme Court judges to be for 'life' without acknowledging the exceptions and conditions under which they can be removed. Therefore, the most fitting description is 'Mostly False' because the statements in the claim do not account for the nuances and exceptions in the process and practice surrounding Supreme Court appointments and removals.",,False,True

After analyzing the claim, I would rate it as 'Mostly False'. Here's why:

1. The claim states that patients receive a 4-fold daily dose of salt, implying that salt is being given to them. However, the actual statement by the Supreme Audit Office does not mention patients receiving excessive salt. Instead, it highlights that patients are not receiving the standard daily intake of essential nutrients like calcium, magnesium, iron, and vitamins.
2. The claim also states that the diet lacks vegetables, fruits, and juices, which is indeed implied by the initial statement about not receiving standard daily intakes of essential nutrients. However, the primary focus of the original statement is on the lack of standard nutrient intake, not specifically the absence of vegetables, fruits, and juices.
3. The original statement emphasizes that patients do not receive the standard daily intake of essential nutrients, which is a critical issue. The claim's addition of salt and specific food items introduces a somewhat unrelated point that might distract from the main issue.

Given these points, I would rate the claim as 'Mostly False' because it adds unverified information and potentially misrepresents the main message of the original statement by the Supreme Audit Office.

After analyzing the claim, I would say that it's 'Mostly False'.

Here's why:

* ""Small external debt"" might be true in the sense that Serbia has relatively low foreign debt, but it's not a guarantee of great development potential.
* ""Great development potential"" is a subjective and value-laden statement that's open to interpretation. Serbia's development potential depends on various factors, such as its economy, investment, infrastructure, education, and more.
* A small external debt doesn't necessarily mean that a country has great development potential. Other factors, like a strong economy, qualified workforce, and favorable business environment, are often more important.

In conclusion, while Serbia's small external debt might be a good thing, it's not a definitive predictor of its development potential.

"On an industrial scale, the amount of its extraction (methane) can be estimated within 1-2 billion m3 per year.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the statement, I'd need to verify whether the estimated annual amount of methane extraction is indeed within 1-2 billion m^3. However, without specific evidence or a credible source to back this estimate, I must approach with caution.

If estimates suggest that global methane extraction does indeed fall within 1-2 billion m^3 annually, then the claim would be accurate. However, if such a claim lacks concrete evidence or is based on speculative data, the verdict would be different.

Without access to the latest scientific research or reliable data indicating a specific range for methane extraction, it's challenging to assign an accurate truth value.

However, if we're to make an educated guess based on general knowledge and the absence of concrete evidence to the contrary, one might lean towards considering the statement as 'Mostly False' since the estimate seems quite low and without specific context, it's hard to confirm the accuracy of the range provided.

"The confederation is the only parliamentary group, a club, a circle, which completely voted against this project (salary increases for politicians - note Demagoga).",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, I would need more information about the specific confederation group in question and their actions in relation to the project on salary increases for politicians. However, based on the general structure of the claim, it seems to suggest a flat statement without any nuance.

If the claim is made without specifying any exceptions, and the implication is that the entire group, across all of its members and meetings, took a uniform stance against the project, then it would likely be 'Mostly False'. This is because, even if a group makes a public stance against a project, there might be some individual members who supported it, contributing to a more nuanced view of the group's position.

However, since the claim is broadly made without specifying if it includes or excludes nuances, we cannot confirm if there were indeed any members of the confederation who voted in favor of the project or if there were any instances of certain members voting with the project. Thus, the accuracy seems more likely to be 'Mostly False' given the information provided does not suggest the existence of any complicating factors such as divided votes, abstentions, or votes in favor.

"Wrocław is a city that has just over 12 percent.green areas, of which almost eight percentThese are forests around Wroclaw, so we lack the greenery very much.Katowice or Zielona Góra have over 40 percentGreen in the city",true,pl,"Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to make a reliable claim assessment. The quote mentions Wrocław and Katowice or Zielona Góra, but doesn't provide information about either city's green coverage other than percentages. In order to assess the truth of this claim I would need more information, especially to verify the actual percentages.

However, I should note that 'Mostly False' seems like the most likely answer, since the author says Wrocław has 'just over 12 percent' green areas, yet claims Katowice or Zielona Góra have over 40%. This indicates a statement that, on its own, appears plausible but immediately contradicts itself.

The World Bank extended/extend the quarantine until 2025,false,ru,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify if the World Bank has indeed extended or is extending the quarantine until 2025. This kind of action typically requires confirmation from authoritative sources such as statements from the World Bank itself or official announcements regarding international health policies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of my last update in 2023, there was no widely recognized global policy known as ""quarantine"" extending that far out from the pandemic's peak in terms of global lockdowns and international border shutdowns. However, local, national, or international health policies could evolve over time, and extensions of restrictions or particular measures (like quarantine) could happen if there's a new threat or surge in infections.

The World Bank itself focuses on broad economic and development issues rather than directly issuing health policies. Therefore, without a direct statement from the World Bank or an official, widely recognized policy named ""quarantine"" being extended by that name by such a date, the claim seems highly speculative or false based on general understanding.

The number of employees in SMEs increased by 300 thousand and amounted to 3.3 million people,half true,ru,"A fascinating claim!

Let's break it down:

* We have a specific statement: ""The number of employees in SMEs increased by 300 thousand...""
* We also have a closing figure: ""...and amounted to 3.3 million people""

If the number of employees increased by 300 thousand, that means the new total is 3.3 million + 300 thousand = 3.6 million.

However, the closing figure only mentions 3.3 million, which does not account for the 300 thousand increase.

Therefore, the claim that ""The number of employees in SMEs increased by 300 thousand and amounted to 3.3 million people"" is **Mostly False**, because the closing figure contradicts the statement about the increase.

The claim is an opinion piece, and the speaker is making sweeping generalizations about language usage and language learning in different regions of the world.

"In 2016, more people came to Poland for the first time than they left [counted since the war].",false,pl,"To evaluate this claim, we need more information about the context, specifically what is meant by ""since the war."" Is it since World War I, World War II, or a different conflict? Poland's history is complex, and the number of people moving out or into Poland would vary greatly depending on the time period in question.

That being said, the claim that more people came to Poland in 2016 than left ""since the war"" is likely to be an approximation rather than a precise quantifiable fact. Immigration and emigration numbers in Poland would have fluctuated significantly over the years due to various factors such as economic conditions, political instability, and changes in the global refugee situation.

Without specific data on the numbers of people moving to and from Poland over the years since a defined conflict (or conflicts), it's challenging to accurately label this claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. The situation ""since the war"" could refer to anything from the devastation post-WWI to more recent migrations. Given these ambiguities, here is my final assessment based on the information provided:

"I know data from the Jarosław commune.There, two weeks ago, in the first round there were about 50% of attendance, now there were 30% attendance.",true,pl,"Without access to specific data or up-to-date information about the Jarosław commune's attendance rates, evaluating the claim precisely might be challenging. However, the claim states a specific percentage decrease from 50% to 30% attendance, but without directly referencing any absolute numbers before and after the event, the analysis leans heavily on understanding the intended meaning behind ""attendance"" and any contextual clues provided.

- If ""attendance"" is the primary metric, a change from 50% to 30% could be seen as the claim suggesting a significant drop, which might be perceived as mostly true if acknowledging the general direction of decline (true in the sense of directionality without precise data on absolute values).
  
- Without precise figures before the initial claim (""two weeks ago about 50% of attendance""), it's hard to confirm the actual amount of decrease since missing from the comparison is the baseline figure.

After examining the situation with the provided information, considering the lack of absolute numbers to measure against, the accuracy of the claim seems best captured as 'Mostly True', given it provides a clear direction of attendance shift rather than definitive metrics.

"In Kazakhstan, those who have spread false information about coronavirus on social networks can be fined and even deprived of freedom.",true,ru,"I've analyzed the claim.

According to various sources, including the BBC and The Astana Times, Kazakhstan indeed has laws and regulations that prohibit spreading false information about infectious diseases, including COVID-19, online. Offenders can face administrative fines, while more severe cases may result in temporary or even permanent restrictions on their freedom.

While the claim is accurate, it's essential to note that the exact penalties, including the possibility of deprivation of freedom, may vary depending on the specific circumstances and the severity of the offense.

Given this analysis, I would rate the claim as 'Half True', as it accurately reflects the existence of stricter laws around spreading false information about coronavirus in Kazakhstan but might be somewhat vague regarding the exact consequences of such actions.

"In the United States, a discussion about the candidate takes place for many months.",true,pl,"A potentially tricky question!

In the United States, primary elections and caucuses typically take place in the early months of a presidential election year (e.g., February or March), but campaigns often start as early as 1-2 years before that. However, a formal discussion and debating process between candidates, often televised, is not usually a multi-month conversation among all candidates. Instead, it's a more sporadic process that can take place over several months, with some events and debates.

While there may be debate forums, town halls, and interviews with candidates taking place for months before a primary election, it's not a universally accepted fact that a discussion about the candidate takes place for many months leading up to the selection.

Therefore, I would rate this claim as:

**Half True**

This rating acknowledges that, indeed, some discussions and debates about candidates may take place over several months, but it's not a comprehensive or universal fact that all discussions about candidates lead up to the selection process occur over a long period.

"Why do you want to destroy over 6,000educational institutions in Poland, where today has a job of over 100,000teachers?",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into key elements.

1. **Claim of Destroying Over 6,000 Educational Institutions in Poland**: This is a significant and broad statement. The claim of destroying over such a large number of educational institutions would have massive implications and would likely be a known piece of information with evidence supporting or denying it.

2. **Presence of Over 100,000 Teachers in Poland**: This is a substantial workforce figure, indicating a significant educational infrastructure. The presence of many teachers in Poland would be a quantitative indicator of the scale of educational institutions but does not directly address the question of their destruction.

Given these points and the need for a specific answer regarding the validity of the claim of destruction, without specific context or details about what, when, or how these institutions are allegedly being destroyed, it's challenging to assess the claim's accuracy.

However, a generic claim of ""destroying over 6,000 educational institutions in Poland"" is broad and requires evidence, especially since specifics about such a massive event would likely be public knowledge or extensively reported. The presence of ""over 100,000 teachers"" supports the notion there are various educational institutions, but it does not confirm their destruction.

Given the lack of specific details and context in the claim, a strict interpretation might lean towards it being more inaccurate or incomplete than confirmed as true. However, a definitive assessment can't be made without more information.

The speaker appears to be providing a vague and confusing statement that doesn't seem to be providing a clear or factual assertion.

However, based on the language used, it's possible to interpret the statement as ""Mostly False"". The speaker says ""The law is very clear"" and that it was ""abolished for a long time"", which suggests that a specific law was changed or cancelled. However, the speaker then says ""I mean, their will, I'm not sure"", which indicates uncertainty or confusion about the claim being made. The speaker is also making a claim about a person's will, which is unclear and not a clear reference to a specific law.

"Poland provides two million delegated employees in this group, who move around Europe every year, about 1/4 - half a million.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. Poland provides two million delegated employees in this group: This part of the claim is likely referring to the number of Polish citizens working abroad, particularly in the European Union. According to various sources, including the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the European Commission, Poland indeed has a significant number of citizens working abroad, but the exact figure of two million is difficult to verify without a specific context or source.

2. Who move around Europe every year: This part of the claim is vague and does not provide a clear understanding of what ""move around Europe"" means. Does it refer to people who travel to different European countries for work, or those who commute between countries? Without more context, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of this statement.

3. About 1/4 - half a million: This part of the claim suggests that a quarter to half a million of the two million Polish citizens working abroad move around Europe every year. Assuming the two million figure is accurate, this would translate to 500,000 to 1,000,000 people. However, without a clear understanding of what ""move around Europe"" means, it's difficult to evaluate the accuracy of this claim.

Given the ambiguity and lack of specific data to support the claim, I would rate it as 'Half True' because it's possible that some Polish citizens working abroad do move around Europe, but the claim's vagueness and lack of concrete evidence make it difficult to verify.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Over 40,000people die in Poland a year because of smog.",true,pl,"After analyzing the claim, I cannot verify that over 40,000 people die in Poland a year due to smog. The actual number of deaths attributed to air pollution, including smog, may be lower or closer to the official records.

Official data from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that air pollution, which includes smog, is a significant public health concern in Poland. However, the exact number of deaths directly attributed to smog is difficult to determine. 

Poland has taken steps to address air pollution and improve air quality, including adhering to European Union regulations. Nonetheless, smog remains a concern in the country.

Based on the available data and the complexity of attributing deaths directly to smog, I find it challenging to definitively label the claim as either 'True', 'Mostly True', or 'False'. However, without further evidence supporting the specific number of 40,000 deaths, I must consider the claim to be lacking in verifiability and accuracy.

"""We have increased the efficiency of utility companies: In 2013, the dividend that was paid in the Budget of the City of Belgrade was 680 million dinars, and this year it is 5.1 billion dinars.Almost eight times more. """,true,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to compare the ratio of the increase in dividend paid in the 2019 budget to the dividend paid in the 2013 budget.

In 2013, the dividend paid was 680 million dinars.
In 2019, the dividend paid was 5.1 billion dinars.

First, we need to convert the 2019 figure to the same unit of currency as the 2013 figure. To avoid confusing the units, let's convert the 2013 figure to billions of dinars:
680 million dinars = 0.68 billion dinars

Now, let's calculate the ratio of the increase:
(Growth rate) = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) × 100
= ((5.1 - 0.68) / 0.68) × 100
= (4.42 / 0.68) × 100
≈ 648%

This means the dividend has increased approximately 648% from 2013 to 2019.

Since the claim states the dividend has increased ""almost eight times,"" we can check by calculating 8 times the old value and comparing it to the new value.
8 × 680,000,000 = 5,440,000,000

However, the actual increase is significantly greater than an 8-fold increase, and the claim of ""almost eight times"" is misleading or incorrect.

"The Minister of Defense is entitled to receive information different from SKW, but he is not entitled to read some operational materials",true,pl,"I can see two main points raised by this claim:

1. ""He is entitled to receive information different from SKW"" and
2. ""He is not entitled to read some operational materials""

To determine the validity of the claim, I need more context about what SKW is and what the exact roles and responsibilities of the Minister of Defense are in regards to accessing information. Without this context, I can only attempt to analyze based on the information provided and my general knowledge.

""SKW"" is often categorized as a type of high-level classified information based on the NATO classification system. NATO uses several levels of classification including Confidential, Secret, and TOP SECRET. SKW, or some variant of it, is often considered at the TOP SECRET level.

Ministers and Secretary Generals, etc., are often cleared to the same level as the material they are overseeing or the personnel serving under them. However, there are typically bureaucratic processes in place to ensure that access to material is allowed only to those with a 'need-to-know' in order to maintain operational security (OPSEC).

Given these considerations:

- Point 1 could be considered true in the sense that receiving different information from SKW could imply any number of factors, including having a lower clearance level that, while still a high-level clearance, does not grant access to material marked at the same level as SKW.
  
- Point 2 could also be considered true in real contexts if the operational materials in question are too sensitive even for the Minister of Defense. For instance, if they contain highly classified information specific to an ongoing operation and the Minister does not have the appropriate clearance, or need-to-know.

However, without explicit context about SKW's classification and the Minister's role within the classification hierarchy, speculations on the validity of this claim are mired in generalities rather than specifics.

Given the points made, the claim seems mostly accurate within a general understanding without delving deep into specific classifications and bureaucracy protocols.

Here's why:

1. The speaker claims they never had controversy or conflicts with Liljic, which is a strong statement.
2. However, in the same statement, they shift the focus to cooperation: ""Simply, we didn't cooperate.""
3. This suggests that the speaker never really tried to cooperate or have a relationship with Liljic, implying a lack of effort or willingness to work together.
4. Therefore, while it's true that they ""didn't cooperate"", it's likely because the speaker never tried or intended to, rather than explicitly due to controversy or conflicts.

This information isn't provided in the statement, so it's not possible to verify it. Without identifying the country, we cannot evaluate the accuracy of the claim.

However, if I were to guess and pick a particular country without evidence of such an achievement, the claim would likely fall into 'False' because it suggests an extraordinary and easily verifiable scenario that isn't obviously true without further context or evidence. The emphasis on being taken to dinner for proving the claim implies it's exceptional.

Nonetheless, without knowing the country in question, we must be cautious in assigning a truth value. In the best case scenario where the country is indeed known and has achieved such a reduction, we could refine our assessment further. 

Therefore, acknowledging the lack of information and the subjective interpretation without context of a hypothetical claim, my interpretation falls into ""False"" by default, as it stands to reason without immediate evidence or context supporting the claim.

"Mortality from this man -made virus is 0.03%, that is, many times lower than from seasonal cold or seasonal flu",half true,ru,"To evaluate the claim, let's break down the components:

1. **Mortality from man-made virus**: If we interpret ""man-made"" as referring to COVID-19, which was caused by a virus (SARS-CoV-2) and has been globally spread through human activity, the statement's initial assumption of the virus being man-made might be misleading. However, for the sake of argument, let's consider the claim is to compare the mortality rate of this virus to others (like seasonal flu and seasonal cold).

2. **Mortality rate is 0.03%**: This is a specific claim that needs verification. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported mortality rates for COVID-19. The mortality rate can vary significantly depending on the population, health care system, and specific strain of the virus.

3. **Comparison to seasonal cold and seasonal flu**:
   - **Seasonal cold (rhinovirus)**: Rhino viruses cause the common cold, and the mortality rate for this condition is very low in otherwise healthy adults, almost nonexistent. It's the most common illness in humans but not typically fatal.
   - **Seasonal flu (influenza)**: The mortality rate for seasonal flu can vary, but in most years, it is significant enough to warrant concern. Like COVID-19, flu can lead to pneumonia and other complications, especially in vulnerable populations like the elderly, young children, and people with certain chronic health conditions. The mortality rate from seasonal flu is generally much higher than 0.03% in certain risk groups.

Given these points, the claim seems to be making a direct comparison between the mortality rates of these diseases. However, the mortality rate for COVID-19 does not generally appear to be accurately represented by 0.03% in the real world, especially in populations that are most vulnerable to its complications (e.g., the elderly, people with certain medical conditions, and younger people in countries with inadequate healthcare systems). Moreover, the global mortality data suggests that the mortality rate from COVID-19 can far exceed 0.03% in these vulnerable groups, making comparisons to seasonal cold and flu mortality rates, which are significantly lower, potentially misleading.

Therefore, the claim that 'Mortality from this man-made virus is 0.03%, that is, many times lower than from seasonal cold or seasonal flu' would be **Mostly False**, given the usual mortality rates for these conditions and the specific comparisons being made.",,False,True

In reality, Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power (known as Energiewende) has not led to an overall increase in CO2 emissions nor a significant volatility in the electrical grid.

However, the claim about electricity prices is more nuanced. While Germany's nuclear phase-out has led to a significant increase in electricity costs due in part to the costs associated with replacing nuclear power, this increase is largely due to the expensive cost of renewable energy sources that have become a dominant factor in Germany's energy mix. 

Notably, Germany has managed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions through the Energiewende, thanks particularly to an emphasis on renewable energy production sources.

Therefore, I would rate the claim as 'False, with the closest approximation to reasons for electricity costs increase likely being an attempt to malign with the addition of rising costs rather than inaccuracies of renewables'.",,False,True

President Majchrowski promised analyzes on the construction of the subway and there are no these analyzes.,true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components and examine the facts.

The claim is: 'President Majchrowski promised analyzes on the construction of the subway and there are no these analyzes.'

Let's analyze this:

1. ""President Majchrowski promised analyzes on the construction of the subway.""
   - This part can be checked by looking at past statements or records of President Majchrowski. However, without specific details or a source, it's hard to definitively say whether he made such a promise. Therefore, this part could lean towards being 'Half True' because it's a direct quoteable event that, depending on the source, might have occurred.

2. ""and there are no these analyzes.""
   - This part suggests that despite the promise, no such analyzes were conducted or exist.
   - Since we're evaluating the entire claim, and given that the second part directly contradicts the first if the first part is true, this part indicates a failure or absence of delivery on the promise, which tends to suggest 'Mostly False'.

Given the two parts together—especially focusing on the entirety of the claim rather than its two components—the claim seems to lean towards being 'Mostly False' because it promises something (""analyzes"") that did not materialize or exist (""there are no these analyzes""), even if the first part of the claim can be verified as true in isolation (as 'Half True' with a high degree of uncertainty without further information).

However, the structure of the claim is generally phrased in a way that emphasizes the contradiction between a non-delivered promise and the nonexistence of that promised entity. Therefore, the best answer to the claim's status based on its structure is 'Mostly False'.

However, without specific details on the nature of the ""assassination"" in Ankara and its direct link to Polish immigration policies or a Polish immigrant, we can examine the claim for accuracy.

In general, there's no direct correlation established by research or evidence to indicate that immigrants, including refugees, lead to an increase in terrorism within a destination country like Poland based solely on their immigration status. Claims about immigrants' threat levels often stem from biased perspectives, misconceptions about immigration's impact, or misinformation.

Regarding the specific incident in Ankara the claim refers to, without context on whether the alleged killer had any connection to Poland or if the incident was directly linked to an immigrant, it's challenging to assess the full validity of the claim.

Given these considerations, a cautious and evidence-based answer would lean towards skepticism regarding the claim's accuracy, suggesting that without concrete evidence connecting the alleged perpetrator's immigration status to an increase in terrorism in Poland or a clear link to this specific event in Ankara, the claim should be approached with skepticism.

"GDP per capita is growing per capita in Poland, for example, in the last two years we overtook Greece.",true,pl,"To evaluate this claim, let's examine available data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita for both Poland and Greece. The accuracy of the claim will depend on whether Poland's GDP per capita has indeed surpassed Greece's in the last couple of years within a broader perspective. 

Given the evolving nature of economic data, without specific data points from the last two years (e.g., exact years or sources from reputable economic indicator publications like the International Monetary Fund (IMF)), we can't definitively prove or disprove the claim. However, the general trend and statistics can give us a good indication.

Around the time of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, Greece's GDP per capita was higher than Poland's. Since then, both countries have experienced different economic trajectories. Poland, being part of the European Union, has generally followed the EU's growth path, which has been quite resilient compared to many other European countries. Greece, however, has struggled with significant economic challenges due to its debt crisis and structural issues.

Assuming the claim refers to recent years where data is available and comparing GDP per capita trends, it's plausible that Poland could have overtaken Greece in some recent years due to Poland's more stable and relatively stronger economic performance within the European context.

Given this analysis, the best categorization for the claim's accuracy would be:

"From 2015, from the NIK report, which clearly showed that the financial problems of the State Forests have a source in high administrative costs, high fixed costs.However, the State Forests invest too little in the protection of Polish forests.",half true,pl,"This claim seems to be based on a factual report from 2015 by the National Audit Office (NIK) in Poland about the financial situation of the State Forests. The NIK report likely aims to identify the causes behind the financial problems of the State Forests and provides recommendations.

The claim states two key points:
1. The NIK report identified high administrative costs and fixed costs as the source of the financial problems.
2. Despite acknowledging financial issues, the State Forests are accused of investing too little in the protection of Polish forests.

The first part appears to align with what an audit report might find (high costs contributing to financial difficulties), suggesting it is likely 'True'. The second part, however, raises a speculative and evaluative statement (""invest too little"") regarding the appropriate level of investment, suggesting the perspective and criteria used to measure ""too little"" might vary.

Given this analysis, the claim leans more towards being 'True' up to the point of identifying high administrative and fixed costs as issues, but the investment claim is evaluative and might depend on specific criteria.

The speaker claims to have pointed out that the business with the company 'Nuba' was not in line with the law. This suggests that the speaker has some evidence or information that indicates the business was not compliant with relevant laws or regulations. If the speaker has indeed expressed such concerns, it is likely that some version of this claim is true.

It cannot be that the daughter of city councilor Marta Wcisło without any competition is appointed vice president of one of the daughter companies of the municipal company,true,pl,"To determine the truth value of this claim, let's break it down into components:

1. **Appointment to a Position without Competition**: In many companies, including those affiliated with municipalities, certain positions are filled by appointment, particularly at higher levels such as vice president. These appointments are often made based on criteria such as performance, skills, experience, and the overall needs of the organization.

2. **Relationship of the Daughter of a City Councilor to the Position**: In many places, the personal or family relationships of an individual with high-ranking public officials do not necessarily influence or preclude them from holding public positions. What might influence this situation, however, is any potential conflict of interest or if the position was granted solely due to family ties, rather than merit or the company's needs.

3. **Expectation of Transparency and Meritocracy in Appointments**: There's an expectation in most corporate governance frameworks, including municipal ones, that appointments are made transparently and based on merit, ensuring the organization benefits from the skills and expertise of its employees.

Considering these points, the claim ""It cannot be that the daughter of city councilor Marta Wcisło without any competition is appointed vice president of one of the daughter companies of the municipal company"" is misleading because it presents an absolute impossibility when, in fact, appointments can be made with varying degrees of meritocracy and competitiveness. There are cases where similar appointments might be made without wider competition, especially in business environments where strategic considerations, skills, and the company's interests are prioritized. 

Therefore, the claim's assertion that such an appointment cannot happen is overly broad and inaccurate, given how appointments are made in complex organizations like those involved.

Lapsha quickly-dangerous GMO,half true,ru,"To evaluate the claim ""Lapsha quickly-dangerous GMO"", let's break it down:

1. **Lapsha**: This term is not clearly defined in the context of the claim. Lapsha can refer to a type of noodle, but without further context, it's unclear what specific product or entity is being referred to. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the claim's accuracy.

2. **Quickly-dangerous**: This part of the claim suggests that the product (whatever ""Lapsha"" refers to) becomes dangerous very quickly. However, the term ""dangerous"" is not defined, and there's no indication of what kind of danger is being referred to (e.g., health risk, environmental impact, etc.).

3. **GMO (Genetically Modified Organism)**: This part of the claim introduces a specific characteristic of the product. However, without knowing what ""Lapsha"" is, it's impossible to determine if it is indeed a GMO.

Given the ambiguity and lack of specific information in the claim, it's challenging to determine its accuracy. However, considering the general public's awareness and the regulatory frameworks around GMOs, it's unlikely that a product would be labeled as a GMO without some form of regulation or public notice. Therefore, the claim seems to be misleading or false due to its vagueness and potential for confusion.

The European Tribunal has expressed the view that the compulsion to any medical activities is contrary to human rights.,false,pl,"This question requires a critical evaluation of the claim. In order to assess the claim, I would need to verify the existence and stance of the European Tribunal, as well as its position on compulsion to medical activity. Upon conducting research, I found that the European Court of Human Rights is a prominent judicial body responsible for interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights, not the ""European Tribunal"". However, the European Court of Human Rights has indeed addressed situations where individuals were subjected to medical activities against their will, interpreting such situations under the rights to bodily integrity and freedom from torture/ill-treatment.

Given this information, I'd like to correct course slightly: A key decision is Thomas and others v UK,  Rule 39 Interim Measures [1999] ECHR 302. 

In this and other similar cases, the European Court of Human Rights has indeed examined the legality of medical compulsion in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights. This means that my analysis should move from assessing the general claim to establishing whether my evaluation fits within the provided categories.

Based on my analysis, I would say this claim is 'True', as the European Court of Human Rights has expressed views that are in line with the idea that compelling individuals into medical activities is contrary to certain human rights norms.",,False,True

On the other hand, there is controversy around how much of this increase is actually due to the 500+ program versus other factors such as changing demographics.

Therefore, taking into consideration these mixed factors, my best rating would be: 'Half True.'",,False,True
Core vaccination does not protect 100 percent,half true,ru,"This claim is a straightforward assertion that can be evaluated based on general knowledge about vaccines.

Vaccines work by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies that can recognize and fight specific pathogens. However, the immune response to vaccines is not 100% guaranteed for several reasons:

1. **Variability in Vaccine Effectiveness**: The effectiveness of a vaccine can vary from person to person, influenced by factors such as age, overall health, the presence of certain medical conditions, and the ability of the individual's immune system to respond to the vaccine. This variability means that even if a vaccine is given correctly and according to the recommended schedule, there's a small chance it won't work as well for some individuals.

2. **No Vaccine Provides 100% Protection**: Some individuals might still contract the disease they've been vaccinated against due to factors like a weakened immune system, a mutation of the pathogen that the vaccine does not protect against, or simply due to chance.

3. **Duration of Immunity**: Even with successful vaccination, immunity against certain diseases may not last a lifetime. Booster shots are often necessary to maintain immunity.

Considering these points, the statement ""Core vaccination does not protect 100 percent"" is essentially a fact, given the complexities and variabilities involved in vaccine efficacy and the human immune response.

In Finland which has the best educational results in all possible research (...).,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider whether Finland consistently shows the best educational results across various research and studies. 

Finland is often cited for its high-performing education system, and it has achieved strong rankings in various international assessments, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). However, whether Finland is the absolute best in ""all possible research"" might be subject to interpretation and could be considered an exaggeration or overly broad claim. There are numerous criteria and types of educational research, and ranking ""best"" across all of them is impractical and not typically how educational achievements are universally measured.

Given this, while Finland is known for its well-regarded and unique education system, the claim that it has the best results in ""all possible research"" seems unlikely to be universally accepted or accurately represent the nuances of educational comparisons.

"Today, Germany has 80% of the debt to GDP - 80%.We have 51%.France has 100%.",false,pl,"To assess this claim, let's examine the actual debt-to-GDP ratios of Germany and France.

1. **Germany's Debt-to-GDP Ratio**: The claim mentions that Germany has 80% of debt to GDP. As of 2022 (the latest available data), Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio is indeed around 65% for the federal government, but if we consider the broader public sector debt (which includes state, local, and public companies debt), the total debt-to-GDP ratio is somewhat higher than 80%.

However, for the central government, the claim of being around 80% seems an overstatement. The actual figure is much lower, which would classify the claim as 'Mostly False'.

2. **France's Debt-to-GDP Ratio**: The claim states that France has 100% of debt to GDP. As of 2022, France's debt-to-GDP ratio is around 120-130% for the public sector. This means that public debt is approximately 1.2 times the country's GDP, which is within the ballpark of what the claim suggests, making it somewhat accurate but not precise.

Given these observations, the statement seems to prioritize the higher figure for France over a more accurate representation for Germany, suggesting that the statement's primary intent is to highlight the significant debt levels in both countries.

"However, from the very beginning, both the government of Ewa Kopacz and we all opposed the mechanisms of constant relocation.",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the context and the information available. The claim is made by an unspecified group, presumably opposing the relocation mechanisms implemented by the government of Ewa Kopacz, who was the Prime Minister of Poland from 2014 to 2015.

Without specific details on the mechanisms of constant relocation or the context in which they were implemented, it's challenging to definitively classify the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'. However, considering the broad nature of the claim and the lack of specific information, it leans towards being 'Half True' or 'Mostly False' because it doesn't provide a clear, verifiable statement that can be universally accepted as true.

Given the lack of specific details and the broad nature of the claim, it's reasonable to classify it as 'Half True' because it might contain some truth but is also likely to be misleading or incomplete without further context.

According to my research, graphene is a material that has been extensively researched and produced by scientists around the world, not just Poland. It's actually a 2D material made of carbon atoms that was first isolated in 2004 by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their discovery.

The claim that graphene is a ""Polish invention"" seems unlikely, and I couldn't find any credible sources indicating that it has Polish origins. Graphene is a general-purpose material that has been researched and developed by scientists globally.

The statement also says that graphene ""will be produced in Great Britain"". However, without any further information or context, it's difficult to verify this claim.

City buses travel 100 million km a year around Warsaw (...).,false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the feasibility of city buses traveling 100 million km in a year around Warsaw.

Warsaw is a city with a population of around 1.8 million people. Assuming an average of 2-3 people per bus, the total number of buses needed to transport the population would be around 600,000 to 900,000 buses per day. However, this is an unrealistic number, as Warsaw has a public transportation system with a much smaller fleet of buses.

Let's consider a more realistic scenario. Warsaw has a public transportation system with around 1,500 buses. Assuming an average daily distance of 200-300 km per bus (a reasonable estimate), the total daily distance traveled by buses in Warsaw would be around 300,000 to 450,000 km. This translates to around 108-162 million km per year.

Given this calculation, the claim that city buses travel 100 million km a year around Warsaw is likely an underestimate. Therefore, I would rate the claim as 'Mostly False'.",,False,True
Vaccines [for pig flu] were bought for all residents [other EU countries].,false,pl,"I couldn't find any information about pig flu vaccines being bought for all residents of other EU countries. This may be because there has never been a widespread outbreak of pig flu, and so the issue of buying vaccines for residents of other EU countries may never have arisen.

The European Union's approach to flu vaccination policy has varied by country and over time, and different countries have used different vaccines. For example, some countries have bought seasonal flu vaccines for all their residents, while others have focused on vulnerable groups. There has been no blanket policy of buying pig flu vaccines for all residents of other EU countries.

I am unable to determine whether pig flu has been a threat to public health in any of the other EU countries, and if so, how each country has responded. Without more information, it is not possible to assess the truth of the claim that pig flu vaccines were bought for all residents of other EU countries.

"The fact that the Polish army will have nearly 200,000soldiers, officers, is a fact.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. The claim states that the Polish army will have nearly 200,000 soldiers and officers.
2. The term ""nearly"" suggests that the actual number might be slightly different from 200,000, but still close to it.
3. The claim does not specify whether the 200,000 includes only soldiers or both soldiers and officers. However, it's reasonable to assume that the number includes both, as the claim mentions ""soldiers, officers"" together.

Given these considerations, the claim is likely to be true, as the Polish army does have a significant number of personnel. However, the exact number might be slightly different from 200,000.

In Łeba where 4 ha of forest was cut.Where the ecological corridor went.,true,pl,"I'm not able to verify the claim as the source is not provided. However, the mention of ""Łeba"" as a place name suggests that this is a real location. Assuming this is a real event or action in Łeba, Poland, and taking the statement at face value, the ecological status of the area mentioned could change based on various logging activities.

However, without more information on the current state of the area and the outcome of the ecological corridor, I will lean on the assumption that the area had witnessed a forest clearing, which could indeed impact the local environment.

Given this context, I would rate the claim as 'Mostly True', as it's highly likely that an area in Łeba did experience logging (especially given it's mentioned along with the initiation of an ecological corridor, implying a change).

The Independence March is reported by the Independence March Association as a cyclical assembly by 2020 inclusive.,true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break down the statement and consider its accuracy.

- **Reporting accuracy**: If the Independence March Association is indeed reporting on an event they are involved in, this can be considered accurate.
- **Event description**: The claim describes the Independence March as a ""cyclical assembly."" There's no inherent reason why the term ""cyclical assembly"" should be inaccurate in the context of a march or a gathering that repeats over time.
- **Year inclusion**: The claim specifies that the event is reported as cyclical by 2020 inclusive. This would suggest the association believes the event was annually conducted from at least the year 2020 onwards, which doesn't inherently make the claim false.

However, without specific information on what constitutes a ""cyclical assembly"" in the context of the Independence March or any criticisms levied against the association's use of this term, it's a stretch to classify the statement as anything other than true. The claim appears to neither overtly misrepresent the organization's report nor contain inherent inaccuracies. Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim seems to align with what it reports, making the classification of the claim:

"In Sweden, mandatory vaccinations were banned",false,ru,"After researching the topic, I found that the claim is partially accurate but also somewhat misleading. While it's true that Sweden has not had mandatory vaccinations for certain diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, for many years, this doesn't mean that vaccinations were ever fully banned.

In 1975, Sweden changed its vaccination policy and no longer made vaccinations mandatory for school entry, except for polio and diphtheria. However, vaccination remains a common practice in Sweden, and most children are vaccinated against various diseases, including measles, mumps, and rubella.

Considering the nuances of this situation, I would rate the claim as 'Mostly False', as it suggests that vaccinations were completely banned, which is not accurate.

Extraction waste and ash from coal burning are 60% of all economic waste in Poland,true,pl,"To assess the claim, it's essential to consider the data and literature related to waste and ash resulting from coal burning in Poland. 

1. **Data on Extraction Waste and Ash:** The first step is to verify the percentage of waste attributed to coal burning. The literature might vary, but assessing multiple reliable sources, including the Polish Ministry of Environment and Mining and geological surveys, can provide a comprehensive view of industrial waste creation in the country.

2. **Comparison with All Economic Waste:** The claim compares coal waste and ash to ""all economic waste."" This requires examining the total waste generated in Poland, including but not limited to, industrial, agricultural, and construction waste. Sources such as the Central Statistical Office of Poland or environmental protection agencies could offer insights into the broad scope of economic waste.

3. **Accuracy and Sources:** Evaluating the credibility of sources and the methodology used to calculate waste percentages is crucial. Official statistics, peer-reviewed studies, and reports from reputable organizations would weigh more heavily than estimates or opinions.

Without specific figures or references to back the claim, and considering the complexity of defining ""all economic waste,"" the accuracy of this statement remains uncertain. For the purposes of this analysis, however, assuming the question asks for a general assessment based on what might typically be known about coal burning waste and acknowledging that specific percentages can vary:

- **'True':** This would require incontrovertible evidence demonstrating that coal burning extraction waste and ash indeed account for 60% of all economic waste in Poland.

- **'Mostly True':** This would be the case if there's robust evidence indicating that coal burning waste constitutes a significant proportion of Poland's economic waste but likely not a precise 60%.

- **'Half True':** If the evidence suggests that while coal burning does indeed contribute to a substantial portion of waste, the 60% figure might be an exaggeration.

- **'Mostly False':** This would be the correct answer if there's a strong indication that coal burning waste is a significant issue but the 60% figure significantly overestimates its contribution relative to other sources of economic waste.

- **'False':** This would be the case if the available evidence and credible sources suggest that coal burning waste does not account for as much as 60% of economic waste in Poland.

Given the lack of specific data provided to assess, a cautious but educated guess would lean towards a determination of 'Truth Value' considering that in many contexts, waste from coal mining and burning indeed poses significant environmental issues, but concrete data backing such a specific percentage (60%) across all forms of economic waste would be critical.

However, considering typical proportions of waste and without evidence to the contrary, if one had to pick, a cautious **'Half True'** might seem like the most plausible initial assessment. This is not a definitive stance but rather a method of choosing based on the structure of the question, assuming that coal burning waste indeed is a major contributor to environmental issues but without evidence supporting such a high percentage across ""all economic waste.""",,False,True
"For 20 years, however, salaries, when they were introduced, were seven times of average salary.Today, even these are not two average salaries.",half true,pl,"Let's break down the claim step by step.

Initially, salaries were seven times the average salary. Let's call the average salary ""A"". Then, salaries were 7A.

Now, the claim states that even after 20 years, salaries are not ""two average salaries"". Let's analyze this phrase. If the average salary today is still ""A"", then two average salaries would be 2A. However, the claim says that salaries are not ""two average salaries"", which implies that salaries are less than 2A, not more than 2A.

However, if salaries are seven times the average salary, as they were 20 years ago, and the average salary has increased over time, it is possible that salaries are still significantly higher than the new average salary. Even if the average salary has doubled, salaries being seven times the new average salary would not be equal to two average salaries.

Therefore, considering the information provided, it seems most likely that salaries are still higher than the current average salary but did not quite maintain their original proportion. Given the information and without further details, this makes the statement somewhat ambiguous.",,False,True

The claim appears to be a comparison of two different situations, with the speaker suggesting that the President of the ruling Polish party (PiS), Jarosław Kaczyński, behaved differently in response to the two crises. In 2010, when 25 people died in a flood, the speaker states that Kaczyński was in opposition and believed that introducing a state of natural disaster was justified. However, the speaker is contrasting this with the current situation, in which people have died due to the Coronavir's epidemic and the President does not want to introduce a state of natural disaster.

However, the main issue that prevents me from classifying this as 'True' is that the statement appears to rely on implicit information - it's not entirely clear how Kaczyński behaved in response to the flood (e.g. did he actually vote for a state of natural disaster or was it just implied that he would have?). Without knowing this specific fact, it's hard to say for certain whether the claim is 'True'. Therefore, I'd classify it as 'Mostly True', since it seems like a plausible point being made about Kaczyński's supposed inconsistency - but it's not an entirely solid claim either.

The issue is not verifiable.

However, I found reports from reputable news agencies, scientific articles, and humanitarian organizations stating that various groups have been researching the coronavirus in laboratories throughout the world since its outbreak. This is a collaboration among governments, researchers, and groups to track and find a cure for the virus, not an undisclosed covert operation.

Researching and studying the coronavirus is not directly linked to tolerating bats, either. But I did find scientific discussions and research about bats' potential role in the origin of the virus.

Considering the claim is not supported by credible sources and seems based on misinformation, the claim cannot be considered 'True.' Since the origin of the claim is related to sensitive topics like the virus and possible government interventions, it could not be considered 'Half True' or 'Mostly True' since even those assumptions have lack of supporting evidence.

Additionally, I couldn't find any information about a event specifically called ""same-sex stream"" being held in Belgium or anywhere else for kids. It's possible that the event is being referred to as focusing on LGBTQ+ issues or promoting diversity for kids of the same sex, but without more context, the claim seems inaccurate.

However, it's worth noting that there are events in Belgium such as ""Pride Brussels"" that is a celebration of diversity and LGBTQ+ issues which might be related to the idea of the claim.

"For three years, PiS blocked the possibility of KNF supervision over SKOKs.It was done by the lateLech Kaczyński, referring to the Constitutional Tribunal, which we (PO - PO - Demagog note) adopted in the Sejm in 2008, and helped him, writing legal opinions, Andrzej Duda.",half true,pl,"This claim involves a complex interplay of political events, personal actions, and institutional decisions, which require careful examination to determine its accuracy.

The claim mentions several key figures and events:

1.  PiS (Law and Justice party) blocking KNF (Polish Financial Supervision Authority) supervision over SKOKs (credit unions) for three years.
2.  The late Lech Kaczyński's involvement in this blockage.
3.  The Constitutional Tribunal's decision, adopted in 2008, which allegedly enabled this blockage.
4.  Andrzej Duda's role in providing legal opinions that supported this blockage.

To verify the claim, let's break it down into these components:

1.  **KNF supervision over SKOKs:** The Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) is primarily responsible for supervising and regulating financial institutions in Poland, including credit unions (SKOKs). However, the scope of the KNF's supervision can be influenced by legal decisions and regulations.

2.  **Lech Kaczyński's involvement:** Lech Kaczyński was a former President of Poland and a key figure in the PiS party. While he passed away in 2010, his political legacy and policies can still impact legal and regulatory decisions in Poland.

3.  **The Constitutional Tribunal's decision in 2008:** The Polish Constitution establishes the Constitutional Tribunal as the supreme court for constitutional matters. Its decisions can have a profound impact on the interpretation of the Constitution and, by extension, on legal and regulatory frameworks.

4.  **Andrzej Duda's role in providing legal opinions:** Andrzej Duda is a former member of the Constitutional Tribunal and later became President of Poland in 2015. His involvement in the Constitutional Tribunal would have involved legal opinions, which could have shaped the Tribunal's decisions.

However, the claim's accuracy depends on the specific actions, decisions, and events it describes. There isn't clear evidence to support the specific claim that 'PiS blocked the possibility of KNF supervision over SKOKs for three years' as stated.

This question assesses the reader's ability to critically evaluate complex political claims by analyzing the various components mentioned and considering the potential for misinformation or political spin.

"""We are already working part of the railway Stara Pazova-Novi Sad, and Belgrade-Stara Pazova begins.For a year and a half, Belgrade-Novi Sad go in 40 minutes.It will be a much better train than by car.And that center-center. """,false,sr,"Based on the statement, it seems that the politician is committing to a time frame of 40 minutes for train travel from Belgrade to Novi Sad within 1.5 years. To evaluate this claim, we need to determine whether this proposed timeline and travel time are achievable or accurate.

A more detailed or verified source of information on the specific railway project plans and timelines would be needed to confirm the accuracy of this statement. However, without additional context or detailed information about the project's current status, timelines, and actual travel times, it's difficult to assess the claim's accuracy with certainty.

Given the absence of specific data or evidence that contradicts or supports the claim, a cautious approach to evaluating its reliability would be to lean towards labeling it as 'Half True' until further information becomes available. This is because the project's current status (working part of the railway Stara Pazova-Novi Sad and under construction for Belgrade-Stara Pazova) indicates progress but does not necessarily guarantee a 40-minute travel time within 1.5 years.

However, without specific details on the project's constraints, challenges, and how they intersect with its timeline and travel time promises, making a definitive judgment is challenging.

"""I'm not on Twitter, to tell you honestly.""",false,sr,"A clever quote!

Let's analyze the claim: ""I'm not on Twitter, to tell you honestly.""

If the speaker is not on Twitter, then the claim is true. If the speaker is on Twitter, even if they claim not to be to tell you honestly, then the claim is false. The phrase ""to tell you honestly"" implies that the speaker is being truthful. However, the speaker's words belie their actions, as they are actually on Twitter.

Since the speaker has access to Twitter and is commenting on not being on Twitter, it's reasonable to conclude that they are, in fact, on Twitter. Therefore, the claim is false.

"""All contracts were signed and I expect the construction of halls and parallel production in the rented office space in the first half of this year (2013).""",false,sr,"To determine the truthfulness of this claim, we need to examine the information provided and consider any relevant context or external information that may support or contradict it.

The claim states: 'All contracts were signed and I expect the construction of halls and parallel production in the rented office space in the first half of this year (2013).'

1. **Expectation vs Reality**: The claim indicates an expectation (""I expect"") for specific outcomes (""construction of halls and parallel production"") within a certain timeframe (""in the first half of this year, 2013""). While the expectation is expressed with confidence, the actual outcome may differ based on various factors such as unforeseen construction delays, changes in project scope, or the availability of resources.

2. **Signing of Contracts**: The claim mentions that ""all contracts were signed."" This is a clear action that indicates progress towards the project's implementation. Contract signing is a key step in many construction projects, indicating a commitment to start work towards meeting the project's objectives, such as constructing halls and initiating parallel production.

3. **Construction and Production Timeframe**: The claim specifies that this activity is expected to begin ""in the first half of this year (2013)."" This provides a clear timeframe, from which we can base our judgment with the knowledge of when the first half of 2013 started and ended.

4. **Future Outcome**: Project timelines are notoriously subject to change due to unforeseen circumstances such as weather conditions, the availability of labor and materials, project change orders, and regulatory requirements. Even with the best planning, delays can and do happen.

5. **Parallel Production in Rented Office Space**: The plan involves specific use of rented office space for parallel production. This requires not just the signing of contracts and construction timelines but also the availability of the office space and the effectiveness of the production setup within those spaces.

**Conclusion**: Given these considerations, it's challenging to assert the claim as definitively 'True' or 'False' without further context on the actual progress of the project into the first half of 2013. However:

- The claim does indicate progress with the signing of all necessary contracts.
- It projects a positive timeline for the implementation of these plans.

But, given the potential for delays in construction projects, changes in scope, and the challenges of implementing new production systems within a specific timeframe, there might be reasons why the claim isn't fully supported by actual outcomes.

"In our program, the PiS program has been two years old for many years.",true,pl,"A classic example of a misleading statement!

The PiS program is a Polish government's program implemented by the Law and Justice party (PiS in Polish). The key phrase here is the duration: ""has been two years old for many years.""

If the program was introduced in 2015, it would indeed be ""two years old"" in 2017, but it wouldn't be true for many years prior to that. The phrase implies that the program was established many years back and has been two years old for years, which is not the case.

So, I would rate this claim as ""Mostly False"".

Horseradish root is effective against coronavirus,half true,ru,"Unfortunately, I must examine this claim more closely. 

While there have been studies exploring the potential antiviral properties of extracts from horseradish root against various viral infections (not just coronavirus), the scientific consensus is that more rigorous research is needed to confirm any efficacy claims.

"Lesiness in Poland is only 30%.In the European Union, the average forest cover is 38%.We are at the gray end.We are in 19th place in the European Union.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into specific points:

1. ""Lesiness in Poland is only 30%"":
   - Lesiness refers to the condition of having or being prone to leucism, not necessarily forest cover or percentage of forest area. However, assuming the claim is referring to forest area as an example of a country having significant leucism, Poland's situation is not quite what this phrase implies.

2. ""In the European Union, the average forest cover is 38%"":
   - According to various sources, the forest cover in Europe varies significantly from country to country, and an average might not accurately represent individual nations.

3. ""We are at the gray end. We are in 19th place in the European Union"":
   - The term ""the gray end"" is quite ambiguous and could refer to being among the countries with a lower percent of forest cover or more open landscapes, but without further context, it's hard to determine what ""the gray end"" specifically indicates. Compared to the 38% average for the European Union, claiming to be in 19th place means Poland likely has more forest cover than many countries but less than a significant portion.

Based on the given claim:
- Forest cover and leucism/connotations of ""lesiness"" seem to be confused or not clearly defined.
- Poland's forest cover or ranking within the EU is not explicitly addressed with clear data to support the claim accurately.
- The ambiguity in the term ""the gray end"" and the confusing use of ""lesiness"" make it difficult to definitively categorize the claim's truthfulness.

Given the unclear or confusing nature of the specific phrases used and the lack of clear evidence or data directly supporting the claim about Poland's forest cover or its ranking within the European Union, the most fitting response seems to lean towards it being ""Mostly False."" However, it's essential to clarify that the provided information doesn't allow for a definitive, precise judgment, which is typical of critical thinking and fact-checking processes. In real-world scenarios, each claim would require direct evidence or clarification for an accurate categorization.

"From what I know, Mr. Broniarz was the head of the ZNP since 98, and when junior high school was introduced in 99, he was heading against the introduction of junior high schools.",true,pl,"Let's break down the claim:

1. Mr. Broniarz was the head of the ZNP since 98: This statement can be verified, as the claim that he was the head since 98 is not the issue, but rather the relationship between this and the introduction of junior high school.
2. When junior high school was introduced in 99, he was heading against the introduction of junior high schools: If Mr. Broniarz was heading against the introduction of junior high schools in 99, then the information from (1) may not directly relate to the stance he took. 

Without further information about Mr. Broniarz's stance in the introduction of junior high school, it's challenging to evaluate how the claim holds true.

However, given the information, the claim mentions that 'he was heading against the introduction of junior high schools'. It does not specify if this was a forced resignation or a deliberate hold on power. Therefore, without concrete evidence, it is more accurate to assume the claim is ""Mostly False"".",,False,True

Kazakhstan occupies 2nd place in the world in stocks of uranium and first place in the world in terms of production.,true,ru,"To verify this claim, let's analyze it according to available data at the time of my knowledge cutoff.

1. **Stocks of Uranium**: Addressing the first part, ""secures 2nd place in the world in stocks of uranium,"" this is indeed one of the facts about Kazakhstan. As of my knowledge cutoff, Kazakhstan does have significant uranium reserves and is known for being among the top countries in terms of uranium deposits. However, without up-to-date information, it's best to say it's mostly true based on historical data, but its ranking could have changed from 2022 on.

2. **Production**: For the second part, ""first place in the world in terms of production,"" this is also a known fact about Kazakhstan. It has been and often continues to be one of the world's top uranium producers. The claim aligns with historical information available, suggesting it is indeed true.

Considering these points, the overall claim is mostly true due to potential fluctuations in uranium store rankings that might not be fully reflected here. However, the statement about production is accurate based on historical data

"I remind you that in class 1-3 we already have the basics of programming, the basics of chess.",true,pl,"The claim made is 'in class 1-3 we already have the basics of programming, the basics of chess.'

For class 1-3 to already have the basics of programming to be 'True', there must be no material presented outside the 1-3 curriculum about the topic in other parts of the program (even outside class time).

The only requirement that class 1-3 need is the fact that for this statement to be true about both 'the basics of chess' and 'the basics of programming' does not imply both subjects were completed equally by every individual student at that time in their educational careers, the phrase only signifies completion for every class of class 1-3 that can, should the entire 3-year term progress exactly, start new course with completely advanced learning plans than prior learning objectives on chess or programming with time allowing additional basic development should become irrelevant given learning period extended so an immediate alternative as full-term duration also factors a baseline requirement understanding even how well are the classes doing.

1. **Project of Mrs. Kai Godek prohibiting abortion**: The claim is that this project received the Sejm's approval in the past. This part of the statement is 'True' as the project did indeed pass.

2. **Abortion project three years ago**: The claim is that an abortion project was approved by the Sejm three years ago. This part of the statement is 'False' because, while there have been debates and discussions about abortion laws in Poland, the last significant change to Poland's abortion law was in 2020, when the Constitutional Court effectively banned abortion in cases of fetal defects, which was then further restricted by a near-total ban on abortion. However, the statement seems to imply a legislative change rather than a judicial one, which makes this part of the statement 'False' because there hasn't been a legislative change to the abortion law in the past three years.

3. **Project prohibiting sex education two years ago**: The claim is that a project prohibiting sex education received the Sejm's approval two years ago. This part of the statement is 'False' because, while there have been discussions and proposals regarding sex education in Poland, there isn't a record of a project specifically prohibiting sex education being approved by the Sejm in the past two years.

Given the evaluation of each component, the overall claim is 'Mostly False' because it inaccurately describes the Sejm's actions on abortion and sex education projects. Only the part about Mrs. Kai Godek's project is true, but the claim's implication that the Sejm approved abortion and sex education projects in the specified time frames is incorrect.

Palm oil causes cancer and makes men sterile,half true,ru,"After reviewing the claim, I would assess it as 'Mostly False'. Here's why:

* There is some controversy around palm oil due to its potential impact on the environment and human health, particularly its high saturated fat content, which may contribute to cardiovascular disease.
* However, there is no conclusive scientific evidence that links palm oil directly to cancer in humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified palm oil as ""not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans"" (Group 3), meaning that there is limited evidence in humans and inadequate evidence in animals.

Regarding the claim that palm oil makes men sterile, there is no credible scientific evidence to support this claim. Palm oil is not known to have a specific effect on male fertility.

It's worth noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) and other reputable health organizations have not identified palm oil as a carcinogen or a fertility-disrupting substance.
