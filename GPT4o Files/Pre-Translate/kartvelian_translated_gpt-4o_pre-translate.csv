Part of the state budget spent did not affect the depreciation of the GEL,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Part of the state budget spent did not affect the depreciation of the GEL,"" we need to consider the relationship between government spending and currency depreciation.

Government spending can influence a country's currency value in various ways. Increased spending can lead to higher inflation, which might depreciate the currency. However, if the spending is balanced by increased revenue or does not significantly impact inflation, it might not affect the currency's value.

Without specific details on how the state budget was spent and the broader economic context, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, stating that part of the budget spent did not affect the depreciation of the GEL suggests that some spending had no impact on the currency's value, which is plausible in certain scenarios.

Given the general nature of the claim and the potential for some government spending to have a neutral effect on currency depreciation, the claim can be considered as having some basis in truth but lacking complete context.

"25,000 invalid ballots were not recorded in Adjara",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""25,000 invalid ballots were not recorded in Adjara,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there are credible sources or official statements from election authorities or independent observers that confirm or deny the claim.
2. **Context**: Understand the context in which the claim was made, including the specific election and the region of Adjara.
3. **Data Accuracy**: Verify the number of invalid ballots reported and whether they were recorded or not.

Without specific data or credible sources to confirm the claim, it is challenging to determine its accuracy. However, if there is no evidence supporting the claim, it would be considered false.

Given the lack of specific information and verification:

"Against Rustavi 2 we saw illegal, coordinated actions of two branches - court and public ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Against Rustavi 2 we saw illegal, coordinated actions of two branches - court and public ..."", we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding the situation involving Rustavi 2, a prominent television station in Georgia.

Rustavi 2 has been involved in several legal and political controversies, particularly regarding ownership disputes and allegations of government interference. Critics have claimed that the judiciary and other public institutions have acted in a coordinated manner to undermine the station's independence, suggesting potential illegal actions.

However, without specific evidence or a detailed investigation into the particular actions of the court and public institutions, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. The claim implies a level of coordination and illegality that would require substantial proof.

Given the complexity and the need for concrete evidence to support such a serious allegation, the claim can be considered speculative without further substantiation.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"“During court disputes, when the business and the state dispute each other, 99% of the state of state ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""During court disputes, when the business and the state dispute each other, 99% of the state of state ..."", we need to consider the context and available data regarding the outcomes of legal disputes between businesses and the state.

1. **Lack of Specific Data**: There is no universally accepted statistic that states that 99% of court disputes between businesses and the state result in a particular outcome. Legal outcomes can vary widely based on jurisdiction, the specifics of the case, the legal arguments presented, and the evidence available.

2. **General Legal Principles**: In many legal systems, the state does not have an inherent advantage over businesses in court disputes. Courts are designed to be impartial and to adjudicate based on the law and facts presented.

3. **Possible Misinterpretation**: The claim might be a misinterpretation or exaggeration of a specific context or a particular set of cases, but without concrete evidence or a reliable source to back up the 99% figure, it cannot be considered accurate.

Given the lack of evidence and the general principles of legal fairness, the claim appears to be an exaggeration.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"In Kutaisi, the least in the percentage, the least people are running in the elections",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In Kutaisi, the least in the percentage, the least people are running in the elections,"" we need to verify two key points:

1. The percentage of people running in the elections in Kutaisi compared to other regions.
2. The absolute number of people running in the elections in Kutaisi compared to other regions.

Without specific data on the percentage and number of candidates running in the elections in Kutaisi and other regions, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, the claim suggests that both the percentage and the absolute number of candidates are the lowest in Kutaisi.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute this claim, the most appropriate response based on the available information is:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Until 2021 for political officials limited salaries,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Until 2021 for political officials limited salaries,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of salary regulations for political officials up to that year.

1. **Context**: Political officials' salaries are often regulated by laws and policies that can vary by country, state, or municipality. These regulations can include salary caps, adjustments, and other limitations.

2. **Specifics**: The claim is somewhat vague as it does not specify which country or political system it refers to. However, it implies that there were limitations on political officials' salaries up until 2021.

3. **General Understanding**: In many countries, there have been long-standing regulations and limitations on the salaries of political officials. These regulations are typically in place to ensure that public funds are used responsibly and to prevent excessive compensation.

Given the general nature of the claim and the fact that salary limitations for political officials have been a common practice in many places, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim holds some truth, though it lacks specificity.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
“The Ministry of Education has been holding the elections of directors for 2 years.80%of schools of the schools are one ...,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The Ministry of Education has been holding the elections of directors for 2 years.
2. 80% of schools are one ...

Without additional context or specific data to verify these points, it is challenging to determine the exact truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the information provided, we can make an educated guess.

Given that the statement is incomplete and lacks sufficient context, it is difficult to fully assess its accuracy. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"In 2004-2012, the GDP of the agrarian sector was decreasing at constant prices, with an average of 1.2%, during our period ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the data regarding the GDP of the agrarian sector from 2004 to 2012. This involves checking historical economic data from reliable sources such as government reports, economic databases, or reputable research publications.

Given that I don't have access to real-time data or databases, I can't directly verify the specific figures for the agrarian sector's GDP over that period. However, I can provide a general approach to how you might verify this information:

1. **Consult Official Economic Reports**: Look for reports from national statistical agencies or international organizations like the World Bank or FAO that track agricultural GDP.
2. **Check Academic Studies**: Research papers or studies that analyze economic trends in the agrarian sector during the specified period.
3. **Historical Economic Data**: Use databases like the World Bank's World Development Indicators or FAOSTAT to find historical GDP data for the agrarian sector.

If you have access to such data and it confirms that the GDP of the agrarian sector was indeed decreasing at an average rate of 1.2% per year from 2004 to 2012, then the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows a different trend, the claim would be adjusted accordingly.

Since I cannot access the data directly, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided and without additional data, I cannot make a final determination.

Final Answer: Unable to determine.",,False,True
"Teachers were promising to raise salaries and only 250 out of about 60,000 teachers increased the tree ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Teachers were promising to raise salaries.""
2. ""Only 250 out of about 60,000 teachers increased the tree ...""

For the first part, teachers themselves typically do not have the authority to promise salary increases; this is usually the responsibility of school boards, government bodies, or unions representing the teachers. Therefore, this part of the claim seems questionable.

For the second part, the phrase ""increased the tree"" is unclear and seems to be missing context or specific information. Without additional context, it's difficult to verify what this means or whether the numbers provided are accurate.

Given the lack of clarity and potential inaccuracies in both parts of the claim, it is difficult to verify the statement as true.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"“The number of employees was reduced from 525 thousand to 480 thousand, from October to April ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The number of employees was reduced from 525 thousand to 480 thousand, from October to April,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The initial number of employees in October was 525 thousand.
2. The number of employees in April was 480 thousand.
3. The time frame from October to April is correctly stated.

If all these points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor inaccuracies or missing context, it might be 'Mostly True'. If there are significant inaccuracies or misleading elements, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Without additional context or data to verify these specific numbers and the time frame, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure and the information provided, assuming no additional context or data is available to contradict the claim, it appears to be a straightforward statement of fact.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
The Ministry of Infrastructure is unable to absorb 50%of the budget.Unalcuted in a high -speed car ...,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Ministry of Infrastructure is unable to absorb 50% of the budget,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Identify where this information is coming from. Is it from a credible source such as a government report, an audit, or a reputable news outlet?
2. **Budget Allocation and Utilization**: Check the actual budget allocation for the Ministry of Infrastructure and compare it with the expenditure reports. This would show whether 50% of the budget remains unabsorbed.
3. **Context and Time Frame**: Understand the context and the specific time frame being referred to. Is this a recent development, or does it pertain to a specific fiscal year?

Without access to specific data or credible sources to verify this claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some factual basis but lacks complete context or verification, it might be considered ""Half True.""

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
We have significant progress in agriculture,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have significant progress in agriculture,"" we need to consider various factors such as technological advancements, productivity improvements, sustainability practices, and global food security.

1. **Technological Advancements**: There have been significant technological advancements in agriculture, including the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), precision farming, and the use of drones and AI for monitoring crops. These technologies have increased efficiency and yields.

2. **Productivity Improvements**: Over the past few decades, agricultural productivity has increased significantly. This is evident in the higher yields per hectare for many crops and the increased efficiency in livestock production.

3. **Sustainability Practices**: There has been a growing emphasis on sustainable farming practices, such as organic farming, conservation tillage, and integrated pest management. These practices aim to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture.

4. **Global Food Security**: While there have been improvements in food production, challenges remain in ensuring global food security. Issues such as climate change, soil degradation, and water scarcity continue to pose significant challenges.

Considering these points, the claim ""We have significant progress in agriculture"" is largely supported by evidence, though there are ongoing challenges that need to be addressed.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"""Studies show that for the first time in these years the confidence in the police has fallen.""",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of Studies**: The claim references ""studies"" but does not specify which studies or their sources. The credibility of the claim depends on the reliability and methodology of these studies.

2. **Historical Context**: The phrase ""for the first time in these years"" is vague. It does not specify a time frame, making it difficult to verify whether confidence in the police has indeed fallen for the first time within a certain period.

3. **Trends in Public Opinion**: Public confidence in the police can fluctuate due to various factors such as high-profile incidents, changes in policing policies, and broader social movements. Historical data from reputable sources like Gallup or Pew Research Center could provide insight into these trends.

4. **Recent Data**: If recent studies or surveys indicate a decline in confidence in the police, it would support the claim. However, without specific data points or references, it's challenging to confirm the statement definitively.

Given the lack of specific details and references in the claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy fully. However, it is plausible that recent events could have led to a decline in confidence in the police.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"In order to mitigate foreign shocks, the government has reduced the 2014 budget deficit",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In order to mitigate foreign shocks, the government has reduced the 2014 budget deficit,"" we need to evaluate two main components:

1. Whether the government has indeed reduced the 2014 budget deficit.
2. Whether the reduction was specifically aimed at mitigating foreign shocks.

Without specific data or context about the government's actions in 2014, it is challenging to definitively verify both components of the claim. However, if we assume that the government did reduce the budget deficit in 2014, the motivation behind this action (i.e., to mitigate foreign shocks) is a more subjective and complex aspect to verify without additional context or statements from government officials.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, it is difficult to fully confirm both parts of the statement. Therefore, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Everyone [alien] can buy land plots, without any restriction",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Everyone [alien] can buy land plots, without any restriction,"" we need to consider the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern land ownership by non-citizens (aliens) in various countries. 

1. **Legal Restrictions**: Many countries have specific laws and regulations that restrict or regulate the purchase of land by non-citizens. For example, in some countries, non-citizens may need special permits, may be restricted from buying certain types of land (e.g., agricultural land), or may face other legal hurdles.

2. **Country-Specific Variations**: The rules and restrictions on land ownership by non-citizens vary widely from one country to another. Some countries may have very few restrictions, while others may have stringent controls.

3. **Practical Considerations**: Even in countries where non-citizens are allowed to buy land, there may be practical considerations such as higher taxes, additional paperwork, or other bureaucratic processes that could be seen as restrictions.

Given these points, the claim that ""Everyone [alien] can buy land plots, without any restriction"" is not universally true. There are indeed restrictions in many places around the world.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"Today, according to the states specified in the state budget, 11 thousand more officials serve ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Today, according to the states specified in the state budget, 11 thousand more officials serve,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Source Verification**: Check the state budget documents to see if there is a specified increase of 11 thousand officials.
2. **Contextual Accuracy**: Ensure that the increase is indeed in the number of officials and not in another category such as contractors or temporary workers.
3. **Time Frame**: Confirm that the increase is current and not from a previous period.

Without access to the specific state budget documents and additional context, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable source and there is no contradictory information, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific evidence to either fully confirm or refute the claim, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"“As a result of competitions in public sector until January 2014, 85%of public servants service ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details regarding public sector competitions and the percentage of public servants in service until January 2014. Without access to specific data or sources that confirm or refute this claim, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment.

However, based on the structure and typical context of such claims, it seems to be a specific and measurable statement. If we assume that the claim is based on verifiable data from a reliable source, it could be considered accurate. Conversely, if there is no data to support it, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific data in the provided context, I cannot definitively verify the claim.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"""You have been convicted of 300,000 people in 9 years""",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""You have been convicted of 300,000 people in 9 years,"" we need to consider the context and the specifics of the statement. The phrase ""You have been convicted"" suggests that the subject of the statement is an individual or entity that has been found guilty of a crime involving 300,000 people over a period of 9 years. 

Given the implausibility of an individual or even a single entity being convicted of crimes involving such a large number of people, it is highly unlikely that this claim is accurate. Additionally, the statement lacks context and specifics that would be necessary to verify its truthfulness.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"Sagarejo has been in the city for 5 years, but there is no water ... People have been watching since 2015 ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Sagarejo has been in the city for 5 years.
2. There is no water in Sagarejo, and people have been watching since 2015.

Sagarejo is a town in Georgia, and it is not clear what is meant by ""Sagarejo has been in the city for 5 years."" This part of the claim is ambiguous and does not provide enough context to verify its truthfulness.

Regarding the second part of the claim about the water situation, there is no widely available information to confirm that Sagarejo has had no water since 2015. If there were a significant water crisis in Sagarejo lasting for several years, it would likely be documented in news reports or official statements.

Given the lack of clear and verifiable information for both parts of the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"37% was approximately state debt and today is 44%, with a major role in the exchange role in that",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The initial state debt percentage of 37%.
2. The current state debt percentage of 44%.
3. The role of exchange rates in the change of state debt percentage.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify these exact figures. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a specific country and time frame, we would need to check reliable sources such as government financial reports, economic analyses, or reputable news articles to confirm these percentages and the impact of exchange rates.

Given the lack of specific data in the claim, it is difficult to definitively verify its accuracy. Therefore, based on the information provided:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"“According to Article 12 of the Law on Legal Entity of Public Law, today the universities are firm ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the content of Article 12 of the Law on Legal Entity of Public Law and its relevance to the status of universities. 

1. **Identify the Law**: The ""Law on Legal Entity of Public Law"" is a specific legal document, and its Article 12 would need to be examined to understand its provisions.
2. **Content of Article 12**: We need to check if Article 12 specifically addresses the status of universities and whether it states that universities are ""firm"" (assuming ""firm"" means established or stable in this context).
3. **Current Status of Universities**: Verify if the current status of universities aligns with the description provided in the claim.

Without access to the specific text of Article 12 and the current legal status of universities, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of legal documents, it is plausible that such an article could address the status of universities.

Given the lack of specific information, the most cautious and reasonable classification would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Electric transport appears in Batumi for the first time not only in the region, but perhaps the whole post -Soviet Siv ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Electric transport appears in Batumi for the first time not only in the region, but perhaps the whole post-Soviet Siv,"" we need to consider the historical context of electric transport in the post-Soviet space.

Electric transport, such as trams and trolleybuses, has been present in many post-Soviet cities for decades. For example, electric trams have been operating in cities like Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kyiv since the early 20th century. Trolleybuses have also been a common mode of electric transport in many post-Soviet cities.

Given this historical context, the claim that electric transport is appearing in Batumi for the first time in the entire post-Soviet region is inaccurate. Electric transport has been established in many other cities within the post-Soviet space long before any recent developments in Batumi.

"Despite increased health funding, poverty increased in 2017 ... Citizens of Health Knife ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Despite increased health funding, poverty increased in 2017 ... Citizens of Health Knife ..."", we need to evaluate two main components:

1. Whether health funding indeed increased in 2017.
2. Whether poverty levels increased in 2017.

Without specific data or context about the region or country referred to as ""Citizens of Health Knife,"" it is challenging to verify these claims definitively. However, if we assume ""Health Knife"" is a placeholder for a specific region or country, we would need to look at the health funding and poverty statistics for that area in 2017.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the question, we cannot conclusively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information available:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"There are 60 streets in Gori for six years, with another 25 streets this year will be added",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. ""There are 60 streets in Gori for six years"" - This part of the claim suggests that Gori has had 60 streets for the past six years. To verify this, we would need historical data on the number of streets in Gori over the past six years.

2. ""with another 25 streets this year will be added"" - This part of the claim suggests that 25 new streets will be added to Gori this year. To verify this, we would need current data or official plans indicating the addition of 25 new streets.

Without access to specific historical and current data on the number of streets in Gori, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and the need for precise data to confirm it, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate classification would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The 2017 FDI is recorded in the history of independent Georgia,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The 2017 FDI is recorded in the history of independent Georgia,"" we need to consider the context and the specifics of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Georgia in 2017.

1. **FDI Recording**: FDI data is typically recorded and tracked by national statistical agencies and international organizations. It is standard practice for countries to keep records of FDI inflows and outflows as part of their economic data.

2. **Historical Context**: Georgia, as an independent country since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, has been recording economic data, including FDI, as part of its national statistics.

3. **2017 Specifics**: According to available data, Georgia did record FDI inflows in 2017. The National Statistics Office of Georgia (Geostat) provides detailed reports on FDI, including annual data for 2017.

Given these points, the claim that ""The 2017 FDI is recorded in the history of independent Georgia"" is accurate because FDI data for 2017 is indeed part of the historical economic records of independent Georgia.

"""14,000 convicts are out of jail and there is no resocialization program""",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""14,000 convicts are out of jail and there is no resocialization program,"" we need to evaluate two main components:

1. The number of convicts out of jail (14,000).
2. The existence or non-existence of resocialization programs.

### Step 1: Verify the Number of Convicts Out of Jail
- The claim states that 14,000 convicts are out of jail. This number needs to be verified against reliable sources such as government reports, criminal justice statistics, or news articles.

### Step 2: Verify the Existence of Resocialization Programs
- Resocialization programs are initiatives designed to help former convicts reintegrate into society. These can include job training, education, counseling, and other support services. The claim asserts that there are no such programs.

### Analysis
- If the number 14,000 is accurate but there are some resocialization programs in place, the claim would be misleading.
- If the number is inaccurate or exaggerated, the claim would also be misleading.
- If there are indeed no resocialization programs, the claim would be more accurate.

Without specific data to confirm or refute these points, we can only make a reasoned judgment based on general knowledge and typical practices in criminal justice systems.

### General Knowledge
- Most countries have some form of resocialization or rehabilitation programs, although their effectiveness and reach can vary widely.
- The number of convicts out of jail can fluctuate and may be reported in various ways (e.g., parole, probation, early release).

### Conclusion
Given the typical existence of some form of resocialization programs in most criminal justice systems, the claim that there are ""no resocialization programs"" is likely an exaggeration. The number 14,000 may or may not be accurate, but without specific data, we cannot confirm it.

"Since 2013, we have been able to provide more than 16,000 IDP family housing, 5 0 of them ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The organization or entity making the claim has indeed been providing IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) family housing since 2013.
2. They have provided more than 16,000 IDP family housing units.
3. The specific number mentioned, ""5 0 of them,"" needs clarification. It could be a typographical error or incomplete information.

Given the incomplete and unclear information in the claim, it is difficult to fully verify its accuracy. The phrase ""5 0 of them"" is ambiguous and does not provide a clear number or context.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
In all villages of Gori municipality there is a problem of irrigation water,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In all villages of Gori municipality there is a problem of irrigation water,"" we would need comprehensive and up-to-date information about the irrigation water situation in every village within the Gori municipality. This would typically involve data from local government reports, surveys, or studies conducted by relevant authorities or organizations.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we can consider the following points:

1. **Generalization**: The claim uses the word ""all,"" which is an absolute term. For the claim to be entirely true, every single village in the Gori municipality must have a problem with irrigation water.

2. **Common Issues**: It is possible that many villages in the Gori municipality face issues with irrigation water, but without specific evidence, it is difficult to confirm that this problem affects every single village.

3. **Variability**: Conditions can vary significantly from one village to another due to factors such as geography, infrastructure, and local management practices.

Given these considerations, the claim seems to be an overgeneralization without specific evidence to support that every single village is affected.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
14 million from Poti's 15 million budget only to salaries and different costs,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""14 million from Poti's 15 million budget only to salaries and different costs,"" we need to verify the specific budget allocation details for Poti. This involves checking the official budget documents or reliable sources that provide a breakdown of Poti's budget.

1. **Budget Verification**: Check the official budget documents for Poti to see the total budget and the allocation for salaries and different costs.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Understand what is meant by ""different costs"" to ensure it includes all relevant expenses that are not salaries but are still part of operational costs.

Without access to the specific budget documents or reliable sources, we can only make an educated guess based on the information provided.

If the claim is that 14 million out of a 15 million budget is allocated to salaries and other operational costs, it suggests that a very high percentage (93.33%) of the budget is used for these purposes. This would leave only 1 million for other expenses, which seems unusually high for administrative and operational costs alone.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute this claim, we can analyze it based on typical budget allocations for municipalities. Generally, while a significant portion of a municipal budget can go to salaries and operational costs, it is less common for it to be as high as 93.33%.

**Analysis**:
- If the claim is accurate, it would indicate a very high administrative cost ratio.
- If the claim is exaggerated, it might be closer to a lower percentage.

Based on typical budget structures and the high percentage implied by the claim, it seems more likely that the claim is an overstatement.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"“No matter how the defendant wanted to discuss his case to jury, the prosecutor every month ...",false,ka,"The claim provided is incomplete and lacks sufficient context to determine its truthfulness. It does not provide enough information about what the prosecutor did every month or how it relates to the defendant's ability to discuss his case with the jury. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately assess the claim based on the given information.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"“According to European, American experience, the head of administration is limited to have an academic…",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze whether it is true that the head of administration in European and American contexts is limited to having an academic background.

In many European and American countries, the head of administration, such as a president or prime minister, is not strictly required to have an academic background. While many heads of administration do have higher education degrees, it is not a formal limitation or requirement. For example, in the United States, there is no constitutional requirement for the president to have an academic degree. Similarly, in many European countries, while higher education is common among political leaders, it is not a mandated criterion.

Given this information, the claim that the head of administration is ""limited to have an academic"" background is not accurate.

"In the first quarter of 2017, Georgian exports to the EU increased by 44%",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In the first quarter of 2017, Georgian exports to the EU increased by 44%,"" we need to verify the data from reliable sources such as official trade statistics from the Georgian government or international trade organizations.

According to the National Statistics Office of Georgia (Geostat), Georgian exports to the EU in the first quarter of 2017 did indeed increase significantly. The specific figure reported by Geostat is a 44% increase compared to the same period in the previous year.

Georgia has high economic growth rates compared to the region and the EU,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Georgia has high economic growth rates compared to the region and the EU,"" we need to examine recent economic data and growth rates for Georgia, its regional peers, and the European Union.

1. **Georgia's Economic Growth**: According to recent data, Georgia has experienced relatively high economic growth rates in the past few years. For instance, in 2021, Georgia's GDP growth rate was around 10.4%, which is significantly high.

2. **Regional Comparison**: When comparing Georgia's growth rates to those of its regional peers (such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, and other countries in the South Caucasus and Eastern Europe), Georgia's growth rate has been relatively strong. For example, Armenia had a growth rate of around 5.7% in 2021, and Azerbaijan had a growth rate of around 5.6%.

3. **EU Comparison**: The European Union, on average, has had lower growth rates compared to Georgia. In 2021, the EU's GDP growth rate was around 5.3%, which is lower than Georgia's growth rate for the same period.

Given this data, the claim that ""Georgia has high economic growth rates compared to the region and the EU"" is supported by recent economic performance metrics.

Tens of thousands of teachers and pensioners are less than dollar than in 2012,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Tens of thousands of teachers and pensioners are less than dollar than in 2012,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Inflation and Cost of Living Adjustments**: If salaries and pensions have not kept pace with inflation since 2012, the real purchasing power of teachers and pensioners could be less, even if their nominal income has not decreased.

2. **Salary and Pension Data**: We would need to look at specific data on teacher salaries and pension payments from 2012 to the present. If there have been no significant increases or if there have been cuts, this could support the claim.

3. **Economic Context**: Economic conditions, such as austerity measures, budget cuts, or economic downturns, could have impacted salaries and pensions.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to the real value of income (adjusted for inflation), it is plausible that many teachers and pensioners could be earning less in real terms than they did in 2012.

Given these considerations, the claim seems to have a basis in reality but may lack precise data to be fully verified.

No international assessment has been discussed in court corruption,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""No international assessment has been discussed in court corruption,"" we need to consider whether there have been any international assessments or discussions regarding court corruption.

International organizations such as Transparency International, the United Nations, and the World Bank have conducted assessments and published reports on corruption, including judicial corruption, in various countries. These assessments often discuss the state of corruption within judicial systems and recommend measures to combat it. Additionally, international forums and conferences frequently address the issue of judicial corruption.

Given this context, the claim that ""No international assessment has been discussed in court corruption"" is not accurate.

We were building a large airport in Guria ... we started construction,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We were building a large airport in Guria ... we started construction,"" we need to verify if there was indeed a project to build a large airport in Guria and if construction had actually started.

1. **Project Existence**: Check if there were official plans or announcements regarding the construction of a large airport in Guria.
2. **Construction Status**: Verify if construction activities had commenced, such as ground-breaking ceremonies, initial construction work, or any other verifiable progress.

Without specific details or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that there is no widely known or documented evidence of such a project or construction activity, the claim would likely be considered inaccurate.

Without access to the exact budget data for those years, it is not possible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the statement.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Georgia has been practically the only country in recent periods that international rating ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgia has been practically the only country in recent periods that international rating ..."", we need to consider the context and the specific international ratings being referred to. International ratings can include credit ratings, ease of doing business rankings, corruption perception indices, and more. 

1. **Credit Ratings**: Multiple countries receive credit ratings from agencies like Moody's, S&P, and Fitch. Georgia is not the only country to receive such ratings.
2. **Ease of Doing Business**: The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index includes many countries, and while Georgia has performed well, it is not the only country to be rated.
3. **Corruption Perception Index**: Transparency International rates many countries on corruption perception.

Given that many countries are evaluated by international rating agencies and organizations across various metrics, the claim that Georgia is ""practically the only country"" is not accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
Your Deputy Governor (Vake) caught the bribe of bribes when he received money in exchange for employment,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details regarding the Deputy Governor (Vake) and whether he indeed received money in exchange for employment. This would typically involve checking credible sources such as news reports, official statements, or legal documents.

Without access to such verification, I cannot definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verified information, it would be considered 'True'. If there is some truth but also some exaggeration or missing context, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the claim is largely incorrect but has a small element of truth, it would be 'Mostly False'. If the claim is entirely incorrect, it would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I cannot make a definitive judgment.

Georgia has missed the chance to participate in the North-South International Highway project,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgia has missed the chance to participate in the North-South International Highway project,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Project Details**: The North-South International Highway project is a significant infrastructure initiative aimed at improving connectivity between countries in the region. It typically involves multiple stakeholders and phases of development.

2. **Georgia's Involvement**: We need to verify whether Georgia was initially considered for participation in the project and if there were any official statements or actions indicating that Georgia has indeed missed the opportunity to be part of it.

3. **Current Status**: It is essential to check the most recent updates on the project to see if there have been any changes or new opportunities for Georgia to join.

Without specific and up-to-date information on these points, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if there is no evidence suggesting that Georgia had a confirmed role in the project and subsequently lost it, the claim could be considered speculative.

"""This is not the decriminalization of the law ... the criminal responsibility remains""",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the context in which it was made. The statement suggests that while there may be changes to the law, criminal responsibility is still maintained. This implies that although certain actions might be treated differently under the law, they are not entirely free from criminal consequences.

If the context involves a legal reform where certain offenses are being reclassified or penalties are being adjusted but the actions in question are still subject to criminal prosecution, then the claim would be accurate.

For example, if a jurisdiction is reducing penalties for a specific crime but not eliminating the criminal classification of that act, the statement would be true. Conversely, if the law is being changed to completely remove criminal penalties for certain actions, then the statement would be false.

Without specific context, but assuming a general scenario where criminal responsibility is indeed maintained despite changes in the law, the claim can be considered accurate.

"500 IDPs House, & Nbsp; which was built by the previous government, Sozar Subari re -repaired",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""500 IDPs House, & Nbsp; which was built by the previous government, Sozar Subari re-repaired,"" we need to verify the following:

1. Whether 500 houses for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were indeed built by the previous government.
2. Whether Sozar Subari, a public figure, was involved in the re-repair of these houses.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to definitively verify these details without additional context or sources. However, assuming the claim is based on factual events, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the previous government did build 500 houses for IDPs, that part of the claim would be true.
- If Sozar Subari did re-repair these houses, that part of the claim would also be true.

Without concrete evidence or sources to confirm both parts of the claim, we can only partially verify it.

Has doubled the volume of foreign direct investments compared to 2012,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Has doubled the volume of foreign direct investments compared to 2012,"" we need to compare the volume of foreign direct investments (FDI) in the current year to the volume in 2012. This requires specific data on FDI for both years.

1. **Gather Data**: Obtain the FDI figures for 2012 and the current year.
2. **Comparison**: Check if the current year's FDI is at least twice the amount of the FDI in 2012.

Without the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the data shows the current FDI is indeed double that of 2012, the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows a significant increase but not exactly double, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the increase is substantial but less than double, it could be 'Half True'. If the increase is minimal or there is no increase, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to verify it:

- **True**: If the current FDI is at least 200% of the 2012 FDI.
- **Mostly True**: If the current FDI is close to double but not exactly.
- **Half True**: If the current FDI is significantly higher but not close to double.
- **Mostly False**: If the current FDI is only slightly higher or the same.
- **False**: If the current FDI is lower than or equal to the 2012 FDI.

1. The budget of the Ministry of Culture has increased to 128 million.
2. In December, Vardzia experienced a serious problem (the nature of which is not specified in the claim).

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the budget increase is a verifiable fact and that there was indeed a significant issue in Vardzia in December, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific details and sources, I would categorize the claim as:

While medical marijuana can be beneficial for various conditions, it still contains psychoactive compounds like THC, which have the potential for dependence and addiction. The risk of addiction is generally lower when used under medical supervision and for legitimate medical reasons, but it is not completely absent.

"The initiative to reflect on the constitution of the Euro-Atlantic Course in 2013, which the Republican ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and details surrounding the initiative to reflect on the constitution of the Euro-Atlantic Course in 2013 and the involvement of the Republican party or any related entities.

1. **Euro-Atlantic Course**: This term generally refers to the strategic and political alignment of countries within the Euro-Atlantic area, often involving NATO and the European Union.
2. **2013 Initiative**: We need to confirm if there was a specific initiative in 2013 related to reflecting on the constitution of this course.
3. **Republican Involvement**: We need to verify if the Republican party (presumably the U.S. Republican Party) was involved in this initiative.

Without specific historical records or detailed context, it is challenging to confirm the exact nature of the claim. However, based on general knowledge:

- The Euro-Atlantic Course is a broad and ongoing strategic concept rather than a specific initiative that would be reflected upon in a single year.
- The U.S. Republican Party's involvement in such an initiative would typically be part of broader foreign policy discussions rather than a specific event in 2013.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support the claim as stated, it is likely to be inaccurate.

2. ""Ar Misbar.com ىالإفراج الإفراج ...Anthrax 'by Anglo-American Media for her Unproven Association with the ...'""

The first part of the claim can be verified by checking the records of the State Audit Office for the year 2011 to see if 11 reports were indeed sent to law enforcement agencies.

The second part of the claim is more complex and seems to be fragmented. It mentions ""Ar Misbar.com"" and ""Anthrax 'by Anglo-American Media for her Unproven Association with the ...'"". This part of the claim is unclear and lacks context, making it difficult to verify without additional information.

Given the fragmented and unclear nature of the second part of the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive verification. However, based on the available information, the claim appears to be a mix of verifiable and unverifiable statements.

"Fuel consumption in Tbilisi City Hall has increased eight times, soft furniture consumption - twice, and is one hundred thousand ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim regarding fuel and soft furniture consumption in Tbilisi City Hall, we would need to verify the following:

1. **Fuel Consumption**: Has the fuel consumption in Tbilisi City Hall indeed increased eight times?
2. **Soft Furniture Consumption**: Has the consumption of soft furniture doubled, and is the expenditure on it one hundred thousand?

Without access to specific data or official reports from Tbilisi City Hall, it is not possible to definitively verify these claims. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified data, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the fuel consumption has increased eight times, this would be a significant rise and should be documented in official records.
- If the soft furniture consumption has doubled and the expenditure is one hundred thousand, this should also be reflected in the budget or procurement records.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute these claims, we cannot definitively categorize the statement. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, it would be considered 'True'. If there is any doubt or lack of evidence, it would be prudent to categorize it as 'Half True' or 'Mostly True' depending on the level of available evidence.

The use of force on the night of June 20 was legitimate ... All international organizations confirm ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. Whether the use of force on the night of June 20 was indeed legitimate.
2. Whether all international organizations have confirmed this legitimacy.

Without specific details about the event in question, it is challenging to verify the legitimacy of the use of force. Legitimacy can depend on various factors, including the context, the actors involved, and adherence to international laws and norms.

Additionally, the claim that ""all international organizations confirm"" the legitimacy is a broad and sweeping statement. It is highly unlikely that every single international organization would have issued a confirmation, as organizations often have different mandates, focuses, and perspectives.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support both parts of the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is not fully accurate.

Final Answer: 'False'",false,False,False
MIA has shown a different approach to the accused in the incidents of Marneuli and Kortskheli,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""MIA has shown a different approach to the accused in the incidents of Marneuli and Kortskheli,"" we need to examine the specific actions and responses of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) in both incidents.

1. **Marneuli Incident**: If the MIA took a particular set of actions, such as arrests, investigations, or public statements, we need to document these actions.
2. **Kortskheli Incident**: Similarly, we need to document the MIA's actions in this incident and compare them to those in Marneuli.

If the MIA's responses were significantly different in terms of the speed of action, the severity of measures taken, or the public communication, then the claim could be considered accurate. If the responses were similar, the claim would be less accurate.

Without specific details on the MIA's actions in both incidents, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on observed differences in the MIA's approach, we can tentatively evaluate it.

Without access to real-time data or specific sources confirming the suspension of these projects, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and accurate information, it could be evaluated as follows:

- If both projects have indeed been suspended by the government, the claim would be 'True'.
- If only one of the projects has been suspended, the claim would be 'Half True'.
- If neither project has been suspended, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information to confirm or refute the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and the need for verification, I would lean towards a cautious approach.

“Tbilisi City Hall has started selling the land with electronic auctions that have been resurrected by Vazisubani ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Tbilisi City Hall has started selling the land with electronic auctions that have been resurrected by Vazisubani,"" we need to verify several aspects:

1. **Tbilisi City Hall's Involvement**: Confirm if Tbilisi City Hall is indeed selling land through electronic auctions.
2. **Electronic Auctions**: Verify if electronic auctions are being used for this purpose.
3. **Role of Vazisubani**: Determine if there is any involvement or influence from Vazisubani in the resurrection or initiation of these electronic auctions.

Without specific information or context about the involvement of Vazisubani in the electronic auctions, it is challenging to fully validate the claim. However, if Tbilisi City Hall is known to use electronic auctions for land sales, but there is no clear evidence of Vazisubani's role, the claim might be partially accurate but not entirely.

This would involve examining the allocated amounts for infrastructure projects and identifying any reductions.

Without access to these specific budget documents and data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided and the lack of specific budgetary details, I cannot accurately assess the truthfulness of the statement.

1. The current and previous number of employees in the public sector.
2. The specific increase in the number of employees.
3. The context and timeframe in which this increase is occurring.
4. Any official statements or data from the government or relevant authorities in the Kedo sector.

Without access to this specific data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information from reliable sources, we might consider it to be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. Conversely, if there is no supporting evidence or if the data contradicts the claim, it could be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific data in the provided context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I must refrain from making a final judgment.

1. Whether the Constitutional Commission has indeed completed its work with zero results.
2. Whether approximately 300 thousand GEL has been spent on it.

Without specific details or evidence to confirm these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable information, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the Constitutional Commission has completed its work but produced no tangible outcomes or results, this part of the claim could be considered true.
- If the expenditure of about 300 thousand GEL on the commission is accurate, this part of the claim could also be considered true.

Given that both parts of the claim need to be accurate for the overall claim to be true, and without concrete evidence to confirm or refute these points, we can only make a tentative assessment.

"""None of the Ministers (after October 1, 2012) have changed the car""",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""None of the Ministers (after October 1, 2012) have changed the car,"" we would need access to specific records or data regarding the car usage of ministers after the specified date. This would include checking if any minister has indeed changed their car since October 1, 2012.

Without access to such specific data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is being made based on accurate and verified information, we can evaluate it accordingly.

Given the lack of specific data to either confirm or refute the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if we were to assume the claim is based on accurate records, it would be evaluated as follows:

- If no ministers have changed their cars since the specified date, the claim would be 'True.'
- If some ministers have changed their cars, the claim would be 'False.'

Since we do not have the data to verify this, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the question and the need for a final response:

There is no more than three months of pre -election [official] period in European democracy,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There is no more than three months of pre-election [official] period in European democracy,"" we need to consider the electoral practices of various European democracies.

1. **United Kingdom**: The official campaign period, known as the ""regulated period,"" typically lasts about six weeks.
2. **Germany**: The official campaign period is not strictly defined, but intense campaigning usually starts a few months before the election.
3. **France**: The official campaign period is about two weeks before the first round of voting.
4. **Italy**: The official campaign period is generally around 30 days.
5. **Spain**: The official campaign period is 15 days before the election.

Given these examples, it is clear that the official pre-election periods vary significantly across European democracies. While some countries have shorter official campaign periods, others have longer or less strictly defined periods. Therefore, the claim that there is ""no more than three months"" of official pre-election period is not universally accurate.

"As for the restoration of justice, more than 300 public officials have been charged in previous years ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""more than 300 public officials have been charged in previous years,"" we need to consider the context and available data. If there is verifiable evidence or credible sources that confirm more than 300 public officials have indeed been charged over a span of years, the claim would be considered accurate. However, if the number is significantly lower or there is no reliable data to support the claim, it would be deemed inaccurate.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the context is a country with a large number of public officials and a history of anti-corruption efforts, it is plausible that more than 300 officials could have been charged over several years.

This without increasing revenue,"" we need to verify two key points:

1. The increase in the number of cars in Tbilisi since 2012.
2. Whether this increase has occurred without a corresponding increase in revenue.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on available data and trends, we can make an educated guess.

1. **Increase in the number of cars**: If there are credible sources or statistical data showing that the number of cars in Tbilisi has indeed increased 2.5 times since 2012, this part of the claim could be considered accurate.
2. **Revenue aspect**: The claim that this increase has occurred without increasing revenue is more complex. Revenue could refer to various types of income, such as municipal revenue from car-related taxes, fees, or other economic activities. Without specific data, it's difficult to verify this part of the claim.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm both aspects of the claim, the most appropriate categorization would be:

"10 years for the private use of cannabis in France, the prison or 7.5 million euros is fine",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the current legal framework regarding the private use of cannabis in France.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, the legal status of cannabis in France is as follows:

1. **Possession and Use**: Cannabis is illegal in France. Possession and use of cannabis can result in legal penalties.
2. **Penalties**: The penalties for possession and use of cannabis can include fines and imprisonment. However, the specific claim of ""10 years for the private use of cannabis"" is not accurate. Typically, possession for personal use can result in a fine of up to €200, and in some cases, imprisonment of up to one year. The severe penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a €7.5 million fine are generally associated with trafficking or large-scale distribution, not personal use.

Given this information, the claim that ""10 years for the private use of cannabis in France, the prison or 7.5 million euros is fine"" is not accurate for personal use. The penalties mentioned are more aligned with trafficking or large-scale distribution.

"“The poor situation in the economy is contagious to other areas.For example, the holy profits of the railway ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The poor situation in the economy is contagious to other areas. For example, the holy profits of the railway ..."", we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The poor situation in the economy is contagious to other areas.""
2. ""For example, the holy profits of the railway ...""

### Analysis:

1. **Economic Contagion:**
   - It is generally accepted in economics that a poor economic situation can have a ripple effect on various sectors. For instance, reduced consumer spending can affect retail, manufacturing, and services. This concept is widely supported by economic theory and historical evidence.

2. **Railway Profits:**
   - The phrase ""holy profits of the railway"" is somewhat ambiguous. If we interpret ""holy profits"" to mean significant or substantial profits, then the claim suggests that even sectors like railways, which might be considered stable or essential, can be affected by a poor economy. This is plausible because reduced economic activity can lead to lower freight and passenger volumes, impacting railway revenues.

### Conclusion:
Given that the first part of the claim is widely supported by economic principles and the second part is plausible based on the interpretation of ""holy profits,"" the overall claim can be considered accurate with some room for interpretation.

Aleko Elisashvili served as an independent member of the Tbilisi City Council. During his time in office, he was known for his activism and vocal stance on various issues affecting the city. However, the claim specifically addresses whether he complied with any legislative initiatives.

If Elisashvili did indeed participate in or support any legislative initiatives, the claim would be false. If he did not participate in any legislative initiatives, the claim would be true. If he participated in some but not all, the claim might be considered mostly false or half true, depending on the extent of his involvement.

Without specific details on his legislative record, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, given his active role and public presence, it is unlikely that he did not comply with any legislative initiatives at all.

Khelvachauri gasification had to be completed by the end of 2015,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Khelvachauri gasification had to be completed by the end of 2015,"" we need to verify the specific timeline and commitments made regarding the gasification project in Khelvachauri.

1. **Research the Project Timeline**: Look for official statements, government documents, or credible news sources that outline the timeline for the gasification project in Khelvachauri.
2. **Check for Completion Status**: Verify if there were any updates or reports indicating whether the project was completed by the end of 2015 or if there were delays.

Without access to specific documents or sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on an official timeline or commitment, it would be reasonable to consider it as 'True' unless there is evidence of delays or changes in the project schedule.

"In 2018, the Ministry of Education has doubled compared to 2012.More than 65,000 mosters ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the Ministry of Education's budget or funding indeed doubled from 2012 to 2018.
2. The context and accuracy of the statement ""More than 65,000 mosters ...""

Since the provided text is incomplete and lacks specific details, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, based on the information given:

1. Without specific data on the Ministry of Education's budget or funding for the years 2012 and 2018, we cannot confirm if it indeed doubled.
2. The term ""mosters"" appears to be a typographical error or an incomplete word, making it difficult to assess its accuracy or relevance.

Virtually all ministries salary is reduced,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Virtually all ministries salary is reduced,"" we need to consider the context and available evidence. The term ""virtually all"" implies that almost every ministry has experienced a salary reduction. 

1. **Context**: If this statement is referring to a specific country or government, we would need to look at recent policy changes or budget cuts that affect ministerial salaries.
2. **Evidence**: We would need to review official announcements, government budget reports, or credible news sources that confirm widespread salary reductions across ministries.

Without specific evidence or context, it's challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, if there is no widespread reporting or official documentation supporting the claim that nearly all ministries have had their salaries reduced, the statement would likely be inaccurate.

"Mamuka Tsaava was not an employee of us, he had worked there before",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Mamuka Tsaava was not an employee of us, he had worked there before,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Mamuka Tsaava was not an employee of us"" - This suggests that Mamuka Tsaava is not currently employed by the entity making the statement.
2. ""he had worked there before"" - This indicates that Mamuka Tsaava was employed by the entity at some point in the past.

If both parts of the statement are accurate, then the claim would be considered true. If either part is inaccurate, the claim would be less accurate.

Given the information provided:
- If Mamuka Tsaava is indeed not currently employed but had worked there in the past, the claim is accurate.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there are credible sources or official reports that confirm the financial damage to the city budget and attribute it directly to the mayor's incompetence.
2. **Context and Evidence**: Understand the context in which the claim is made. Are there specific incidents or decisions by the mayor that led to this financial damage? Is there documented evidence supporting this?
3. **Quantification**: Verify if the amount mentioned (GEL 200,000) is accurate and directly linked to the mayor's actions or decisions.

Without access to specific evidence or reports, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that there is some basis for the claim but it might be exaggerated or lacking full context, we might lean towards a middle-ground assessment.

"“Our government has managed and we have 4.7-4.8% of economic growth last year, it is a great deal ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Our government has managed and we have 4.7-4.8% of economic growth last year,"" we need to verify the actual economic growth figures for the country in question for the specified year. This involves checking reliable sources such as government reports, international financial institutions (e.g., World Bank, IMF), and reputable news outlets.

Without specific data or context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a specific country and year, and if the actual reported economic growth rate aligns closely with the stated 4.7-4.8%, then the claim would be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if the provided growth rate is accurate according to reliable sources, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the actual growth rate significantly deviates from the stated range, the claim would be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Young people aged 20 to 29 make up almost half of the unemployed,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Young people aged 20 to 29 make up almost half of the unemployed,"" we need to look at relevant and recent labor market statistics. The proportion of unemployed individuals within a specific age group can vary significantly by country, region, and over time. 

For instance, in many countries, young people often face higher unemployment rates compared to older age groups due to factors such as lack of experience, education, and job market conditions. However, saying that they make up ""almost half"" of the unemployed is a very specific claim that requires precise data.

Without specific data from a reliable source such as a national labor statistics bureau or an international organization like the International Labour Organization (ILO), it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general trends, it is unlikely that a single age group (20 to 29) would constitute nearly half of the total unemployed population, as unemployment is typically distributed across various age groups.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"All of my vetoes that Parliament overcame later or the constitution shared, or the prince itself ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze its components and context. The claim states: ""All of my vetoes that Parliament overcame later or the constitution shared, or the prince itself ...""

1. **Vetoes Overcome by Parliament**: In many parliamentary systems, a veto by a head of state or government can be overridden by a legislative body. This is true in several countries, including the United States, where Congress can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority in both houses.

2. **Constitutional Sharing**: Constitutions often outline the powers and limitations of different branches of government, including the process for vetoes and overrides. This is a standard feature in many democratic systems.

3. **Prince's Role**: The reference to ""the prince itself"" is ambiguous. If it refers to a constitutional monarchy, the prince or monarch typically has limited powers, often ceremonial, and any veto power they might have is usually symbolic or subject to parliamentary override.

Given these points, the claim seems to mix accurate elements (vetoes being overridden by Parliament and constitutional provisions) with a somewhat unclear reference to a prince's role. However, the overall structure and context suggest a misunderstanding or misstatement of how these elements interact.

"Program - ""Produce in Georgia"" is already funded by 123 projects, 35 in Georgian production ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details provided:

1. The total number of projects funded by the ""Produce in Georgia"" program is 123.
2. Out of these 123 projects, 35 are in Georgian production.

If both of these details are correct, the claim would be 'True'. If only one of these details is correct, the claim would be 'Half True'. If neither detail is correct, the claim would be 'False'. If the numbers are close but not exact, the claim could be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the degree of inaccuracy.

Without specific data to verify these details, I cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is presented with accurate data, I would assess it as follows:

- If the numbers are exactly as stated, the claim is 'True'.
- If the numbers are close but not exact, the claim is 'Mostly True'.
- If one of the numbers is correct but the other is not, the claim is 'Half True'.
- If the numbers are significantly off, the claim is 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

This would include looking into official statements, independent investigations, or credible news sources that have covered the event.

Without access to such specific information, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verified reports or credible sources, we might lean towards it being 'True' or 'Mostly True'. Conversely, if there is no evidence or the sources are unreliable, it could be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Trump's Budget Law Signature is the first time that the occupation of Georgian territories ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify if President Trump's signing of a budget law was indeed the first instance where the occupation of Georgian territories was addressed in such a context.

1. **Historical Context**: The occupation of Georgian territories by Russia has been a significant international issue since the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. Various U.S. administrations have addressed this issue through different means, including statements, sanctions, and diplomatic efforts.

2. **Legislative Context**: U.S. Congress has passed resolutions and laws addressing the occupation of Georgian territories before Trump's presidency. For example, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, signed by President Obama, included provisions related to the territorial integrity of Georgia.

3. **Trump's Budget Law**: If the claim refers to a specific budget law signed by President Trump that explicitly mentions the occupation of Georgian territories, it would be necessary to check the text of that law to confirm if it was indeed the first instance of such a mention in a budget law.

Given the historical and legislative context, it is unlikely that Trump's budget law signature was the first time the occupation of Georgian territories was addressed in U.S. legislation.

"Since 2010, the number of drug users has increased by about 15,000",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Since 2010, the number of drug users has increased by about 15,000,"" we would need to verify it against reliable data sources such as government reports, health organization statistics, or credible research studies on drug use trends over the specified period.

Without access to specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to assess it:

1. **Check Reliable Sources**: Look for reports from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), or national health departments that track drug use statistics.
2. **Compare Data**: Compare the number of drug users reported in 2010 with the most recent data available.
3. **Calculate the Difference**: Determine if the increase is approximately 15,000 as claimed.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to the relevant data and it shows an increase of about 15,000 drug users since 2010, then the claim would be accurate.

Final Answer: Without specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim.",,False,True
The statement that Georgia was defeated in 2011 is the distortion of the fact,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the historical context and events related to Georgia in 2011. 

In 2011, there were no significant military conflicts involving Georgia that would result in a defeat. The most notable conflict involving Georgia in recent history was the Russo-Georgian War, which occurred in August 2008. This war resulted in a defeat for Georgia, with Russian forces occupying the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which declared independence from Georgia.

Given that the statement refers to 2011 and there were no major conflicts or defeats for Georgia in that year, the claim that ""Georgia was defeated in 2011"" is indeed a distortion of the fact.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
It is untrue that the new constitution's rights are restricted to somehow,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""It is untrue that the new constitution's rights are restricted to somehow,"" we need to analyze the statement and its context.

The claim is a double negative: ""It is untrue that... restricted to somehow."" This means the claim is asserting that the new constitution's rights are not restricted in some unspecified way.

Without specific details about the new constitution in question, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the statement is meant to convey that the new constitution does not impose unspecified restrictions on rights, we can evaluate it based on general principles of constitutional law.

Constitutions typically aim to outline and protect rights rather than restrict them. However, most constitutions also include certain limitations or conditions under which rights can be restricted (e.g., for public safety, national security, etc.). Therefore, saying that rights are not restricted ""somehow"" is generally inaccurate because most constitutions do have some form of restrictions or conditions.

Given this general understanding, the claim that the new constitution's rights are not restricted in some way is likely to be misleading.

By 50%reduced foreign direct investment,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""By 50% reduced foreign direct investment,"" we need to consider the context and the data supporting this statement. Without specific context or data, it's challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, I can provide a general approach to assess such a claim:

1. **Context**: Identify the time period and region or country being referred to.
2. **Data**: Look for reliable sources such as government reports, international financial institutions (e.g., World Bank, IMF), or reputable news organizations that provide statistics on foreign direct investment (FDI).
3. **Comparison**: Compare the FDI figures from the specified period to see if there is indeed a 50% reduction.

If there is clear evidence that the defendants had no interaction or involvement with the embedded cables, the claim would be 'True.' Conversely, if there is evidence suggesting any level of interaction or involvement, the claim would be 'False' or fall somewhere in between.

Without specific evidence or context provided, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the phrasing, which suggests a complete lack of interaction, and assuming no contrary evidence is presented, the claim would be considered 'True.'

"""The EU estimates has significantly improved the situation in prisons""",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The EU estimates has significantly improved the situation in prisons,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of the Claim**: The claim suggests that the European Union (EU) has made estimates that have led to significant improvements in prison conditions. However, it is unclear what specific estimates are being referred to and how these estimates directly translate to improvements.

2. **EU Involvement in Prison Reforms**: The EU does engage in various initiatives aimed at improving prison conditions across member states, including funding programs, setting standards, and providing recommendations. These efforts can lead to improvements, but attributing significant improvements solely to EU estimates might be an overstatement.

3. **Evidence of Improvement**: To validate the claim, we would need concrete evidence showing a direct correlation between EU estimates and significant improvements in prison conditions. This would include data on prison conditions before and after the EU's involvement, specific actions taken based on these estimates, and measurable outcomes.

4. **Complexity of Prison Reforms**: Prison reforms are complex and typically involve multiple factors, including national policies, funding, management practices, and international guidelines. While the EU can influence these factors, improvements are usually the result of a combination of efforts rather than a single source.

Given the lack of specific details and direct evidence linking EU estimates to significant improvements in prison conditions, the claim appears to be an overgeneralization.

"Television receivers, modems, smartphones, tablets, netbooks and TVs in Rustavi ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Television receivers, modems, smartphones, tablets, netbooks and TVs in Rustavi,"" we need to consider the context and the information provided. The claim lists various electronic devices and mentions Rustavi, which is a city in Georgia.

The claim does not provide specific details about the availability, usage, or any other context regarding these devices in Rustavi. It simply states the names of the devices and the location. Without additional context or information, it is difficult to assess the truthfulness of the claim.

However, it is reasonable to assume that modern electronic devices such as television receivers, modems, smartphones, tablets, netbooks, and TVs are available in most urban areas, including Rustavi. Therefore, the claim is likely to be generally accurate, but it lacks specific details.

This would involve checking the official budget documents or statements from the relevant authorities.

Without access to the specific budgetary data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the provided information is accurate and based on verified budget documents, the claim would be 'True'. If there are discrepancies or partial truths, the rating would change accordingly.

"Compared to 2012, Georgia's economy has declined in dollars",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Compared to 2012, Georgia's economy has declined in dollars,"" we need to examine the economic data for Georgia from 2012 to the present. This includes looking at key economic indicators such as GDP (Gross Domestic Product), employment rates, and other relevant financial metrics.

1. **GDP Data**: The GDP is a primary indicator of economic health. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Georgia's GDP has generally shown growth over the years from 2012 to the present. For instance, Georgia's GDP in 2012 was approximately $450 billion, and it has increased in subsequent years.

2. **Employment Rates**: Employment rates and job growth are also important indicators. Georgia has seen a decrease in unemployment rates and an increase in job creation over the past decade.

3. **Other Economic Indicators**: Other indicators such as median household income, business growth, and investment in infrastructure also suggest economic growth rather than decline.

Based on the available data, it is clear that Georgia's economy has not declined in dollar terms since 2012. In fact, it has shown growth in several key areas.

“Georgia is in the first and second place among the Eastern Partnership countries.,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Georgia is in the first and second place among the Eastern Partnership countries,"" we need to consider the context and specific criteria being referenced. The Eastern Partnership (EaP) is a joint initiative involving the European Union, its member states, and six Eastern European partners: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.

The claim could be evaluated based on various metrics such as economic performance, democratic reforms, human rights, or integration with the EU. Without specific criteria, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, Georgia is often recognized for its progress in democratic reforms and EU integration compared to other EaP countries.

Given the lack of specific context and criteria, the claim is somewhat ambiguous but not entirely baseless.

Telavi is a town in Georgia, and it is unlikely that any village would have a population of 100,000 Telavi residents, as villages typically have much smaller populations.

Given this context, the claim appears to be highly improbable.

A serious problem with the flooding of the city will get rid of Rustavi,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A serious problem with the flooding of the city will get rid of Rustavi,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Geographical and Environmental Context**: Rustavi is a city in Georgia, and like any city, it could potentially face flooding issues. However, the claim suggests that flooding will completely ""get rid of"" the city, which implies total destruction or abandonment.

2. **Historical Precedents**: There is no historical evidence or precedent indicating that Rustavi has been or is likely to be completely destroyed by flooding. Cities typically have measures in place to manage and mitigate flooding risks.

3. **Current Infrastructure and Mitigation Efforts**: Modern cities, including Rustavi, often have infrastructure and emergency plans to deal with flooding. While severe flooding can cause significant damage, it is unlikely to completely eliminate a city.

Given these points, the claim that flooding will ""get rid of"" Rustavi seems exaggerated and not supported by evidence.

European Values ​​- Italian rescue services are fighting the sinking ships of migrants ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""European Values ​​- Italian rescue services are fighting the sinking ships of migrants,"" we need to analyze the context and the activities of Italian rescue services.

1. **Italian Rescue Services' Role**: Italian rescue services, including the Italian Coast Guard and various NGOs, are primarily involved in search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea. Their main objective is to save lives by rescuing migrants from unseaworthy and often overcrowded boats.

2. **Fighting Sinking Ships**: The phrase ""fighting the sinking ships of migrants"" could be interpreted in different ways. If it implies that Italian rescue services are actively working against the migrants or their vessels, this would be misleading. The primary mission of these services is humanitarian, focusing on rescuing and providing aid to migrants in distress.

3. **European Values**: The reference to ""European Values"" might be suggesting a critique or commentary on the broader European approach to migration. However, this does not change the factual nature of the activities carried out by Italian rescue services.

Given the humanitarian role of Italian rescue services, the claim that they are ""fighting the sinking ships of migrants"" is misleading and does not accurately represent their mission and actions.

2. **Time Frame**: Confirm that the time frame mentioned is indeed the next 4 years.
3. **Amount**: Verify that the amount specified is 8 billion.

Without specific details or context, such as the country or the date of the announcement, it is challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a real announcement, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the government has indeed announced a plan to spend 8 billion on infrastructure over the next 4 years, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there are minor inaccuracies or missing context, it might be 'Mostly True'.
- If the claim is partially correct but contains significant inaccuracies, it would be 'Half True'.
- If the claim is mostly incorrect but has some element of truth, it would be 'Mostly False'.

The Georgian economy has declined in dollars.We made the economy from $ 4 billion to $ 16 billion ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the economic data of Georgia over the specified period. The claim states that the Georgian economy has declined in dollars but also mentions an increase from $4 billion to $16 billion.

1. **Economic Decline in Dollars**: This part of the claim suggests that the Georgian economy has experienced a decline when measured in USD. This could be due to various factors such as currency depreciation, economic contraction, or other external factors.

2. **Growth from $4 Billion to $16 Billion**: This part of the claim indicates a significant increase in the economy's size, from $4 billion to $16 billion. This would imply a fourfold increase.

To evaluate this, we need historical GDP data for Georgia:

- According to the World Bank, Georgia's GDP in 2003 was approximately $4 billion.
- By 2019, Georgia's GDP had grown to around $17 billion.

However, the claim also mentions a decline, which could be referencing a more recent period, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other economic challenges.

Given the data:
- The Georgian economy did grow from around $4 billion to approximately $16 billion (and even slightly more).
- There may have been a recent decline due to specific circumstances, but the overall long-term trend shows significant growth.

**Conclusion**:
The claim is somewhat contradictory because it mentions both a decline and a significant increase. The long-term data supports the increase from $4 billion to $16 billion, but without specific recent data to confirm a decline, the claim is partially accurate but not fully clear.

Without access to the specific data or sources that confirm these numbers, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the numbers provided are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If there is any doubt or lack of evidence to support these numbers, the claim could be considered 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific data verification in this context, I will consider the claim as 'Half True' due to the uncertainty.

1. **Georgian Lari (GEL):**
   - The claim states that the GEL has fallen by up to 6% in recent months.
   - To verify this, we would need to look at the exchange rate data for the GEL over the past few months and calculate the percentage change.

2. **Turkish Lira (TRY):**
   - The claim states that the Lira has dropped by 25% in recent months.
   - Similarly, we would need to examine the exchange rate data for the TRY over the same period and calculate the percentage change.

Without access to real-time data, I can provide a general approach to verify this information:

- **Check reliable financial news sources** for recent reports on the performance of the GEL and TRY.
- **Use financial websites** like XE, OANDA, or investing.com to look at historical exchange rate charts for the GEL and TRY against the USD or EUR.
- **Calculate the percentage change** by comparing the exchange rates from a few months ago to the current rates.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge and recent trends, the Turkish Lira has indeed experienced significant depreciation, often in the range of 20-30% over short periods due to economic instability. The Georgian Lari has also seen fluctuations, but typically less severe than the Lira.

“I am talking about the changes that have been implemented and implemented since the new constitution came into force ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and the factual basis of the statement. The claim states that changes have been implemented since the new constitution came into force. 

1. **True**: If there is verifiable evidence that changes have indeed been implemented since the new constitution came into force, the claim would be true.
2. **Mostly True**: If most of the changes mentioned have been implemented, but there are minor inaccuracies or exceptions, the claim would be mostly true.
3. **Half True**: If the claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or context, it would be half true.
4. **Mostly False**: If the claim has a small element of truth but is mostly inaccurate, it would be mostly false.
5. **False**: If there is no evidence that changes have been implemented since the new constitution came into force, the claim would be false.

Without specific details or evidence to verify the implementation of changes since the new constitution came into force, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, the statement is general and does not provide specific details that can be fact-checked.

"“The salary of the MP is GEL 2,000 and receives 1 600 GEL.Prize in the Parliament of Georgia A ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the salary and additional compensation (prize) received by Members of Parliament (MPs) in Georgia.

1. **Base Salary**: The claim states that the base salary of an MP is GEL 2,000.
2. **Additional Compensation**: The claim also mentions that MPs receive an additional GEL 1,600 as a prize.

To verify this, we would need to consult official sources such as the Parliament of Georgia's official website, government publications, or credible news sources that provide details on the compensation structure for MPs.

If the base salary and the additional prize amount are accurately represented in the claim, then it would be considered 'True'. If there are discrepancies in the amounts or if the additional prize is not a standard practice, the claim's accuracy would be adjusted accordingly.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it aligns with typical parliamentary compensation practices, I would make an educated guess.

1. Whether the Mayor of Rustavi was indeed on vacation.
2. Whether the Mayor of Rustavi received a bonus during that time.

Without specific evidence or reliable sources confirming these details, it is not possible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, based on the lack of verifiable information:

"“In 2011, our agriculture was 20%less than in 2003.Today is an increase in agriculture ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the agricultural data for the years 2003, 2011, and the current year. This involves checking reliable sources such as government agricultural reports, international agricultural databases, or credible research studies.

1. **Agricultural Data for 2003 and 2011**: 
   - We need to find the agricultural output or productivity figures for these years.
   - If the data shows that the agricultural output in 2011 was indeed 20% less than in 2003, this part of the claim would be accurate.

2. **Current Agricultural Data**:
   - We need to check the most recent agricultural data to see if there has been an increase since 2011.
   - If the data shows an increase in agricultural output or productivity from 2011 to the present, this part of the claim would be accurate.

Without access to specific data, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data is accurate based on the claim, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the structure of the claim, it is likely that the person making the statement has access to relevant data. Therefore, if we assume the data is correct:

- The claim that agriculture was 20% less in 2011 compared to 2003 can be considered plausible.
- The claim that there has been an increase in agriculture today compared to 2011 can also be considered plausible.

"“... at no point in them [the National Movement] was in cohabitation.In 9 years, ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the context and specific details about the National Movement being referred to. The statement suggests that at no point in a 9-year period was there cohabitation within the National Movement. 

Without additional context or specific historical details about the National Movement in question, it is challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, based on the information provided, we can analyze the structure and phrasing of the statement.

The phrase ""at no point in them [the National Movement] was in cohabitation"" implies a complete absence of cohabitation during the specified period. If we assume that the National Movement refers to a political or social movement, and if historical records or credible sources confirm that there was indeed no cohabitation during the 9-year period, the claim would be true. Conversely, if there were instances of cohabitation, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific historical context or evidence provided in the statement, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information available:

The Secretary of the Security Council typically serves as an administrative and procedural officer, facilitating the work of the Council but not speaking on its behalf unless explicitly authorized to do so.

Given this context, the claim that ""The Secretary of the Security Council has no right to speak on behalf of the Council"" is generally accurate. The Secretary does not have the inherent authority to represent the Council's views or decisions without specific authorization.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
There is a great demand for Certificates of Bible Freedom ... Everything is under the law,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There is a great demand for Certificates of Bible Freedom ... Everything is under the law,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""There is a great demand for Certificates of Bible Freedom"": This part of the claim suggests that there is a significant interest or need for certificates that presumably affirm one's freedom to use or interpret the Bible. Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify the demand for such certificates. This concept is not widely recognized or documented in mainstream discussions about religious freedom or legal documentation.

2. ""Everything is under the law"": This part of the claim is a general statement that can be interpreted in various ways. If it means that all actions and entities are subject to legal regulations, it is broadly true in the context of a society governed by laws. However, the phrase is quite vague and could be interpreted differently depending on the context.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context to support the first part of the claim and the general nature of the second part, the overall claim appears to be speculative and not well-supported by verifiable information.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Jobs have been reduced to a pandemic,true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Jobs have been reduced to a pandemic,"" we need to consider the context and the meaning of the statement. The phrase is somewhat ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways. 

1. If the claim is suggesting that the number of jobs has been significantly reduced due to the pandemic, this is largely accurate. The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread job losses and economic disruptions globally. Many businesses closed or reduced their workforce, leading to high unemployment rates in many regions.

2. If the claim is implying that jobs themselves have become a pandemic, this interpretation is metaphorical and not literally true. A pandemic refers to a widespread disease, and jobs cannot be a pandemic in the literal sense.

Given the likely intent of the statement is to highlight the significant reduction in jobs due to the pandemic, the claim is mostly accurate but could be clearer in its wording.

"Due to cement dust, most people with tumors are in Kaspi",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Due to cement dust, most people with tumors are in Kaspi,"" we need to evaluate several factors:

1. **Cement Dust and Health Effects**: Cement dust is known to have adverse health effects, including respiratory issues and potentially contributing to cancer. However, the direct causation between cement dust and tumors would require specific scientific studies.

2. **Epidemiological Data**: We would need data showing a higher incidence of tumors in Kaspi compared to other regions, and this data should be linked to cement dust exposure.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: The claim suggests that ""most people with tumors"" are in Kaspi, implying a comparison with other regions. This would require comprehensive health statistics from multiple regions.

Without specific scientific studies and epidemiological data directly linking cement dust in Kaspi to a higher incidence of tumors compared to other regions, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Public official [Ana Natsvlishvili] has no right and dares a lot when he speaks about parliament that he has made an irresponsible decision,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the context and the specific details provided. The claim states that a public official, Ana Natsvlishvili, has no right and dares a lot when speaking about the parliament making an irresponsible decision.

1. **Right to Speak**: Public officials generally have the right to express their opinions, including criticisms of other branches of government, as part of their freedom of speech and their role in public discourse. This is especially true in democratic societies where checks and balances and open dialogue are encouraged.

2. **Dares a Lot**: This part of the claim is subjective and depends on the context of the statement. It implies that Ana Natsvlishvili is taking a bold or risky stance by criticizing the parliament. Whether this is true or not can depend on the political climate, her position, and the nature of her criticism.

3. **Irresponsible Decision**: The claim that the parliament made an irresponsible decision is a matter of opinion and would require specific details about the decision in question to evaluate its responsibility.

Given these points, the claim that Ana Natsvlishvili ""has no right"" to speak about the parliament's decision is factually incorrect because public officials do have the right to express their opinions. The assertion that she ""dares a lot"" is subjective and cannot be definitively proven or disproven without more context.

"""Bendukidze has a $ 200 million property of the Agrarian University for 1 GEL""",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the details surrounding Kaha Bendukidze's acquisition of property related to the Agrarian University and its valuation.

1. **Kaha Bendukidze**: He was a Georgian businessman and politician known for his significant role in economic reforms in Georgia.
2. **Agrarian University**: This refers to an educational institution in Georgia.
3. **$200 million property**: This suggests a high-value asset.
4. **1 GEL**: This is the currency of Georgia, and 1 GEL is a very nominal amount.

The claim implies that Bendukidze acquired a property worth $200 million for a nominal price of 1 GEL. This would be an extraordinary transaction and would likely have been widely reported and scrutinized.

To verify this, we would need to look at credible sources such as news reports, official statements, or legal documents that confirm or refute the transaction details.

Based on available information:

- There are reports that Kaha Bendukidze was involved in the privatization and reform of educational institutions in Georgia.
- Specific details about the exact valuation of the property and the transaction amount would be necessary to confirm the claim.

Given the lack of concrete evidence in the provided context, and assuming no additional information is available to substantiate the exact figures:

"""We have seen the lari rate many times in recent years.""",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have seen the lari rate many times in recent years,"" we need to consider the context and frequency of the lari rate being mentioned or observed. The lari is the currency of Georgia, and its exchange rate can fluctuate due to various economic factors. If the claim is referring to the visibility or discussion of the lari exchange rate in financial news or reports, it is plausible that it has been mentioned multiple times, especially if there have been significant economic events affecting its value.

However, without specific data or context to confirm the exact frequency, we can only make a general assessment based on the likelihood of currency rates being discussed in financial contexts.

1. ""Obstetrician & nbsp; trust rating"": This part of the statement is unclear and seems to be a result of a formatting error. The term ""nbsp;"" is an HTML entity for a non-breaking space and does not contribute to the meaning of the statement. Therefore, this part of the claim is not meaningful in its current form.

2. ""Our bank & nbsp; system is one of the best in Europe"": This part of the statement claims that the bank system in question is one of the best in Europe. To evaluate this, we would need specific data or rankings from reputable sources that compare the quality, reliability, and performance of banking systems across Europe. Without such data, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of this claim.

Given the lack of clarity in the first part and the need for specific evidence to support the second part, the overall claim cannot be fully verified.

1. **Research Revenue Data**: Look up the annual financial reports or credible sources that provide the revenue figures for Georgian Railway for the years 2014, 2015, and other relevant years.
2. **Compare Revenue**: Compare the revenue figures for 2014 and 2015 with other years to see if either of these years had the highest revenue.

Without access to specific financial data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate financial data, we can proceed with the following logic:

- If 2014 or 2015 had the highest revenue compared to other years, the claim would be 'True'.
- If 2014 or 2015 had high revenue but not the highest, the claim would be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.
- If 2014 or 2015 did not have notably high revenue, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on accurate data, I would lean towards:

"According to Dimitri Khundadze, the rate of pensions growth is at least equivalent to the rate of the previous government",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of Dimitri Khundadze's claim that the rate of pensions growth is at least equivalent to the rate of the previous government, we would need to compare the actual rates of pension growth during the current government and the previous government. This involves examining official data on pension increases over the relevant periods.

Without access to specific data on pension growth rates under both the current and previous governments, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and comparable data, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

"""The President's Foundation is a different mechanism and its auditory inspection cannot be implemented""",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the nature of the President's Foundation and the mechanisms for its audit and inspection.

1. **Different Mechanism**: The President's Foundation could indeed be a different mechanism compared to other governmental or non-governmental organizations. This part of the claim could be true if the foundation operates under a unique set of rules or structures.

2. **Auditory Inspection**: The claim that its auditory inspection cannot be implemented suggests that there are no provisions or mechanisms for auditing the foundation. This is a strong assertion and would generally be false unless there is specific legal or structural immunity from audits.

Most foundations, especially those associated with public figures or government officials, are subject to some form of oversight or audit, whether by internal mechanisms, external auditors, or governmental bodies. Without specific evidence that the President's Foundation is exempt from all forms of audit, this part of the claim is likely false.

Given these points, the claim that ""The President's Foundation is a different mechanism and its auditory inspection cannot be implemented"" is misleading. While it might be a different mechanism, the assertion that it cannot be audited is likely incorrect.

Does not change the procedure of calculating the minimum wage and does not increase the minimum wage,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Does not change the procedure of calculating the minimum wage and does not increase the minimum wage,"" we need to consider the context and the specifics of the situation being referred to. 

1. **Does not change the procedure of calculating the minimum wage**: If the context or legislation in question indeed leaves the existing method of calculating the minimum wage unchanged, then this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Does not increase the minimum wage**: If the context or legislation does not result in an increase in the minimum wage, then this part of the claim would also be true.

If both parts of the claim are accurate based on the context, then the overall claim would be true. However, if there is any change in the procedure of calculating the minimum wage or if there is an increase in the minimum wage, the claim would be false or partially false.

Without specific context or additional information, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming no changes or increases are made, the claim would be:

This involves checking for any ongoing projects, government or private sector initiatives, and reports from credible sources that confirm or deny the active reclamation efforts.

1. **Government Reports and Announcements**: If there are official government reports or announcements confirming that reclamation services are actively being provided for agricultural land, this would support the claim.

2. **News Articles and Media Reports**: News articles from reputable sources that report on ongoing reclamation projects would also support the claim.

3. **Expert Opinions and Studies**: Opinions from experts in agriculture or environmental science, as well as studies or research papers, can provide additional context and verification.

4. **On-the-Ground Evidence**: Direct evidence from the areas where reclamation is supposed to be happening, such as testimonies from farmers or visual documentation, would further substantiate the claim.

Without specific evidence or context provided in the question, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that there is some level of ongoing reclamation work based on typical practices in many regions, but without concrete evidence, the most balanced assessment would be:

“The developments in Ukraine and Russia are more likely to export from these countries to Georgia ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and the nature of the developments in Ukraine and Russia, as well as their potential impact on Georgia.

1. **Geopolitical Context**: Ukraine and Russia are both geographically close to Georgia. Developments in these countries can have significant geopolitical implications for Georgia, given its proximity and historical ties.

2. **Economic Impact**: Both Ukraine and Russia have economic relationships with Georgia. Changes in these countries, such as sanctions, economic downturns, or shifts in trade policies, can affect Georgia's economy.

3. **Security Concerns**: Georgia has its own security concerns related to Russia, especially considering the history of conflict in regions like South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Developments in Russia, particularly military actions or political changes, can influence Georgia's security situation.

4. **Political Influence**: Political changes in Ukraine and Russia can also have a ripple effect on Georgia, potentially influencing its domestic politics and international alignments.

Given these points, the claim that developments in Ukraine and Russia are more likely to export from these countries to Georgia is generally supported by the geopolitical, economic, and security contexts.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there is an official report, government document, or credible source that confirms the implementation of 1186 infrastructure projects in the Samegrelo region.
2. **Time Frame**: Ensure that the claim specifies a time frame within which these projects were implemented. Without a time frame, it is difficult to assess the claim's accuracy.
3. **Project Definition**: Clarify what qualifies as an ""infrastructure project."" This could range from small-scale repairs to large-scale constructions, and the definition could impact the count.
4. **Independent Verification**: Look for independent verification or third-party assessments that corroborate the number of projects claimed.

Without access to specific data or sources to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a credible source and there is no immediate contradictory evidence, we might lean towards a cautious assessment.

However, if we interpret it as suggesting that a particular country has the third highest tax burden in the world and is experiencing a reduction in taxes or benefits, we would need specific data to verify this.

The claim is that ""the growth rate of the economy not just decreases, but even the pace of the decline itself is quite a bit.""

1. **Growth Rate Decrease**: This part of the statement suggests that the economy's growth rate is decreasing. This can be true in various economic conditions, such as during a recession or economic downturn.

2. **Pace of Decline**: The second part of the statement suggests that not only is the growth rate decreasing, but the rate at which it is decreasing is also significant. This implies an acceleration in the decline of the growth rate.

To evaluate this claim, we would need specific economic data showing both a decrease in the growth rate and an acceleration in the pace of this decline. Without specific data, we can only assess the logical coherence of the statement.

Given that economic conditions can indeed lead to both a decrease in growth rate and an acceleration in the pace of decline, the statement is plausible. However, without specific data, we cannot definitively confirm its accuracy.

1. ""Throughout Adjara, the number of families in crisis has increased"": This part of the claim suggests that there has been a rise in the number of families experiencing crisis in the region of Adjara. To verify this, we would need data or reports from reliable sources such as government statistics, non-governmental organizations, or reputable news outlets that confirm an increase in families facing crisis in Adjara.

2. ""in a crisis state who is in crisis ..."": This part of the claim is somewhat redundant and unclear. It seems to reiterate the idea that there is a crisis, but it does not add any new information or context.

Given the redundancy and lack of additional context in the second part of the claim, the primary focus should be on the first part. Without specific data or evidence to confirm or refute the increase in the number of families in crisis in Adjara, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

However, based on the structure and redundancy of the statement, it appears to be an attempt to emphasize the crisis situation without providing concrete evidence.

If the available information confirms that the third phase of the water and sewer project in Batumi was indeed scheduled for completion in 2014, then the claim would be 'True'. If the completion date was close to 2014 but not exactly in that year, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the project was significantly delayed or completed much earlier or later, the claim could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information in the prompt, I cannot definitively verify the exact completion date. However, based on the phrasing of the claim, it seems to be a straightforward statement about a scheduled completion date.

The depreciation of the GEL is driven by loans issued by the National Bank to commercial banks,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The depreciation of the GEL is driven by loans issued by the National Bank to commercial banks,"" we need to consider several factors that influence currency depreciation.

1. **Monetary Policy and Loans**: The National Bank's issuance of loans to commercial banks can influence the money supply. If the money supply increases significantly, it can lead to inflationary pressures, which might contribute to currency depreciation. However, this is just one of many factors.

2. **Other Influences**: Currency depreciation can also be driven by other factors such as trade deficits, political instability, changes in foreign exchange reserves, investor sentiment, and global economic conditions.

3. **Direct Causation**: While loans from the National Bank to commercial banks can have an impact, it is overly simplistic to claim that this is the primary driver of currency depreciation without considering the broader economic context.

Given these points, the claim oversimplifies the situation by attributing the depreciation of the GEL primarily to loans issued by the National Bank to commercial banks, without acknowledging the multifaceted nature of currency valuation.

"""For the first time this year, visitors' decline""",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""For the first time this year, visitors' decline,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Context and Data**: We need data on visitor numbers for the current year up to the point of the claim. This includes monthly or quarterly visitor statistics.
2. **Comparison**: We need to compare the current period's visitor numbers with previous periods within the same year to see if there has been a decline.
3. **First Time**: We need to verify if this is indeed the first instance of a decline in visitor numbers for the year.

Without specific data, we can only hypothesize. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified data showing a decline in visitor numbers for the first time in the current year, then the claim would be 'True'. If there have been previous declines in visitor numbers earlier in the year, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, we can only provide a reasoned judgment based on the assumption that the claim is made with accurate data.

1. ""Age pension by 60%"": This part of the claim suggests that the age pension has increased by 60%. To verify this, we would need to look at historical data on age pension rates over a specific period. If the age pension has indeed increased by 60% over a given timeframe, this part of the claim would be true.

2. ""Pensions monthly expenditure increased by 28.3%"": This part of the claim suggests that the monthly expenditure on pensions has increased by 28.3%. Again, we would need to look at data on pension expenditures over a specific period to verify this.

Without specific data or a timeframe, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a recent and relevant period, we can make an educated assessment based on available information.

"Georgian Post is not unprofitable, in 2017 it has been profitable",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Georgian Post is not unprofitable, in 2017 it has been profitable,"" we need to verify the financial performance of Georgian Post in 2017.

1. **Research Financial Data**: Look up the financial reports or credible sources that provide information on Georgian Post's profitability in 2017.
2. **Analyze the Data**: Check if Georgian Post reported a profit or a loss for the year 2017.

Based on available data, if Georgian Post indeed reported a profit in 2017, the claim would be accurate. If it reported a loss, the claim would be inaccurate.

Assuming we have verified that Georgian Post was profitable in 2017:

"“Although salaries are increasing in the public sector, it has been lowered in the private sector ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Although salaries are increasing in the public sector, it has been lowered in the private sector,"" we need to consider recent data and trends in salary changes for both the public and private sectors.

1. **Public Sector Salaries**: Generally, public sector salaries are often subject to government budget decisions, union negotiations, and policy changes. In many countries, there have been instances where public sector salaries have seen increases due to inflation adjustments, cost of living increases, or political decisions.

2. **Private Sector Salaries**: The private sector is influenced by market conditions, company performance, and economic factors. While some industries may experience salary reductions due to economic downturns, others may see increases due to competition for talent, inflation, or company growth.

Given the variability and the need for specific, up-to-date data to make a precise determination, the claim could be contextually accurate in certain regions or industries but not universally true.

Without specific data to confirm the trends in both sectors, the claim can be considered as having some basis but not universally applicable.

The tax burden has increased.Was 24.8% in 2013 and now is 25.5%,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The tax burden has increased. Was 24.8% in 2013 and now is 25.5%,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The tax burden in 2013 was indeed 24.8%.
2. The current tax burden is 25.5%.

If both of these statements are correct, then the claim that the tax burden has increased is accurate.

Given the information provided:
- The tax burden in 2013 was 24.8%.
- The current tax burden is 25.5%.

Since 25.5% is higher than 24.8%, the tax burden has indeed increased.

"""The dynamics of Georgia have changed and the child poverty rate has decreased""",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The dynamics of Georgia have changed and the child poverty rate has decreased,"" we need to examine recent data and trends regarding child poverty in Georgia.

1. **Data Sources**: Reliable sources for this information include the U.S. Census Bureau, the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, and reports from organizations like the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which tracks child well-being indicators.

2. **Recent Trends**: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and reports from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, there has been a general trend of decreasing child poverty rates in many parts of the United States, including Georgia, over the past decade. However, the rate of decrease and the specific dynamics can vary year by year.

3. **Contextual Factors**: The dynamics of child poverty can be influenced by various factors such as economic growth, employment rates, social policies, and demographic changes. For instance, improvements in the economy, increased job opportunities, and effective social programs can contribute to a reduction in child poverty rates.

4. **Verification**: To verify the claim, we would look at the most recent data available. For example, if the child poverty rate in Georgia has shown a consistent decline over the past few years, this would support the claim. Conversely, if the data shows fluctuations or an increase, the claim would be less accurate.

Based on the available information and assuming recent data supports a decline in child poverty rates in Georgia, the claim appears to be accurate but may require some context regarding the extent and consistency of the decrease.

The number of beneficiaries of socially vulnerable and free dining rooms increases,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The number of beneficiaries of socially vulnerable and free dining rooms increases,"" we would need to examine relevant data and trends over a specific period. This would involve looking at statistics from government reports, non-profit organizations, or other credible sources that track the number of people using these services.

Without access to specific data or trends, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent observations or reports, we can make an educated guess.

Given the context of economic challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, or other socio-economic factors, it is plausible that the number of beneficiaries of socially vulnerable and free dining rooms has increased. Many reports and news articles have indicated a rise in the need for social services and food assistance during such times.

"Samtskhe-Javakheti has been armed and expanded to 52 enterprises, 7 new enterprises have been launched",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Samtskhe-Javakheti has been armed and expanded to 52 enterprises, 7 new enterprises have been launched,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. Whether Samtskhe-Javakheti has indeed been ""armed"" (though this term is ambiguous and might need clarification).
2. Whether the number of enterprises in Samtskhe-Javakheti has expanded to 52.
3. Whether 7 new enterprises have been launched in the region.

Without specific and verifiable data from reliable sources, it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume that the term ""armed"" is a mistranslation or misstatement and focus on the expansion and the number of enterprises, we can make an educated guess based on available information.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or deny the exact numbers, the claim cannot be fully validated or refuted. Therefore, the most appropriate response based on the information provided would be:

"Gori Cascading Fountain, for Rehabilitation of GEL 106 000, is dysfunctional",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Gori Cascading Fountain, for Rehabilitation of GEL 106 000, is dysfunctional,"" we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the Gori Cascading Fountain underwent rehabilitation costing GEL 106,000.
2. Whether the fountain is currently dysfunctional.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm these details, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the rehabilitation cost and the current state of dysfunction are both accurate based on available information, the claim would be 'True'. If either of these points is inaccurate or unverified, the claim's accuracy would be affected.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I must base my response on the assumption that both points are accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
“Today we have about a hundred thousand new unemployed in Georgia.Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs ”,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific numbers and context regarding unemployment in Georgia. This involves checking recent and reliable sources such as government labor statistics, reports from the Georgia Department of Labor, or reputable news outlets.

1. **Check the latest unemployment data**: Look for the most recent unemployment figures for Georgia. This can be found on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website or the Georgia Department of Labor's official site.

2. **Contextual understanding**: Understand the time frame and context in which the claim is made. For example, if the claim is made during a period of economic downturn or a specific event like the COVID-19 pandemic, the numbers might be higher than usual.

3. **Cross-reference with multiple sources**: Ensure that the data is corroborated by multiple reliable sources to avoid misinformation.

Without access to real-time data and based on the information provided, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made in a context like the COVID-19 pandemic, where there were significant job losses, it might be plausible.

Given the need for precise data to make an accurate judgment, I would recommend checking the latest statistics from the aforementioned sources.

"In Slovenia, for example, sports involvement is 75%, we have a maximum of 10%",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In Slovenia, for example, sports involvement is 75%, we have a maximum of 10%,"" we need to verify the sports involvement rates in both Slovenia and the unspecified location referred to as ""we.""

1. **Slovenia's Sports Involvement**: According to various sources, Slovenia has a high rate of sports participation, but specific figures can vary. Some reports suggest that a significant portion of the population is involved in sports, but finding a precise and universally accepted figure of 75% is challenging.

2. **Unspecified Location's Sports Involvement**: The claim mentions ""we have a maximum of 10%,"" but without knowing the specific location being referred to, it's difficult to verify this part of the statement. However, 10% seems low compared to many countries' sports participation rates.

Given the lack of precise and universally accepted data for both parts of the claim, it is difficult to fully verify the accuracy. However, the claim seems to exaggerate the differences in sports involvement rates.

Financing of a prosecutor's son did not take place for socially vulnerable money,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Financing of a prosecutor's son did not take place for socially vulnerable money,"" we need to evaluate the evidence and context surrounding the financing in question. This involves understanding whether the funds used were indeed intended for socially vulnerable groups and whether they were misappropriated.

Without specific evidence or context provided, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that there is no evidence suggesting that the funds were intended for socially vulnerable groups, the claim could be considered accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
“... today we got that half a million our citizens in the debtors' registry are registered and one hundred ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""half a million of our citizens are in the debtors' registry,"" we need to verify the actual number of citizens registered in the debtors' registry. This would typically involve checking official statistics or credible sources that track such data.

Without access to the specific data or sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information from a reliable source, it could be considered 'True'. If the number is close but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the number is significantly different, it could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if we were to assume the claim is based on accurate information, the most appropriate response would be:

"In the first quarter of 2015, 5 main export components of Georgia were reduced ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In the first quarter of 2015, 5 main export components of Georgia were reduced,"" we need to verify the export data for Georgia during that period. This involves checking the performance of the main export components and seeing if there was indeed a reduction.

Without access to specific data from the first quarter of 2015, I cannot definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate data, it would be reasonable to consider it as 'True'. 

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I will base my response on the assumption that the claim is accurate.

"By the order of the Mayor of Venice, police officers have the right to shoot anyone who in the city ""Allah Akbar"" ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""By the order of the Mayor of Venice, police officers have the right to shoot anyone who in the city says 'Allah Akbar',"" we need to examine the context and the actual statements made by the Mayor of Venice.

In 2017, Luigi Brugnaro, the Mayor of Venice, made a controversial statement regarding the phrase ""Allahu Akbar"" (which means ""God is great"" in Arabic and is commonly used by Muslims in various contexts, including prayer). He suggested that anyone shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" in St. Mark's Square could be shot by police. This statement was widely reported and criticized for its extreme nature and potential to incite violence and discrimination.

However, it is important to note that such a statement does not constitute a formal legal order or policy. The Mayor's comments were more of a rhetorical expression of a hardline stance on security rather than an official directive that police officers are legally bound to follow.

Given this context, the claim is not entirely accurate as it misrepresents the nature of the Mayor's statement and implies a formal policy that does not exist.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
“We spend 7%of the budget on education and science.We have a restriction in this regard - Constitus of Georgia ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""We spend 7% of the budget on education and science. We have a restriction in this regard - Constitus of Georgia,"" we need to verify two key points:

1. Whether 7% of the budget is indeed allocated to education and science in Georgia.
2. Whether there is a constitutional restriction in Georgia that mandates this allocation.

### Verification:

1. **Budget Allocation**:
   - According to various sources, including government budget reports and financial summaries, the percentage of the budget allocated to education and science in Georgia can vary from year to year. However, it is generally in the range of 6-8%. For the most accurate and current figure, one would need to refer to the latest budget documents from the Georgian government.

2. **Constitutional Restriction**:
   - The Constitution of Georgia does not explicitly mandate a specific percentage of the budget to be allocated to education and science. However, it does emphasize the importance of education and the state's responsibility to support it. Specific budgetary allocations are typically determined by annual budget laws rather than the constitution itself.

### Conclusion:
Given that the claim states a specific percentage (7%) and mentions a constitutional restriction, which is not explicitly present, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Gigla Agulashvili talks about 2013 vintage and wine exports,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Gigla Agulashvili talks about 2013 vintage and wine exports,"" I would need to verify if there is any record or evidence of Gigla Agulashvili discussing the 2013 vintage and wine exports. Gigla Agulashvili is a Georgian politician who has served in various governmental roles, including as the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Protection of Georgia. His primary focus has been on environmental issues rather than wine production or exports.

Given the lack of specific evidence or records indicating that Gigla Agulashvili has discussed the 2013 vintage and wine exports, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is not accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"Wine exports decreased, but we would have had a much worse indicator if not market subversive ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Wine exports decreased, but we would have had a much worse indicator if not market subversive,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Wine exports decreased"": This part of the claim can be verified with data on wine export volumes or values over a specific period. If there is evidence showing a decline in wine exports, this part of the claim would be true.

2. ""We would have had a much worse indicator if not market subversive"": This part of the claim is more subjective and requires understanding what is meant by ""market subversive."" If ""market subversive"" refers to actions or strategies that mitigated the decline in wine exports, we would need evidence showing that such actions indeed had a positive impact on the export figures. Without clear evidence or context, this part of the claim is speculative.

Given the lack of specific data and context provided in the claim, it is challenging to fully verify its accuracy. Therefore, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not fully substantiated.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
We received excess income in property tax and budget for two quarters of 160%...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We received excess income in property tax and budget for two quarters of 160%,"" we need to break down the statement and analyze its components.

1. **Excess Income in Property Tax**: This part of the statement suggests that the income from property tax exceeded expectations. To verify this, we would need data comparing the actual property tax income to the budgeted or expected amount.

2. **Budget for Two Quarters of 160%**: This part of the statement is ambiguous. It could mean that the budget for two quarters was 160% of some baseline (e.g., the previous year's budget for the same period), or it could mean that the income received was 160% of the budgeted amount for two quarters.

Given the lack of specific data and context, it's challenging to verify the exact figures. However, the phrasing ""160%"" suggests a significant deviation from the norm, which is a quantifiable claim.

Without additional context or data to support or refute the claim, we can only assess the plausibility based on typical financial reporting and budgeting practices. Significant deviations like 160% are unusual but not impossible.

**Assessment**:
- If the claim is based on actual financial reports showing that the property tax income was 160% of the budgeted amount for two quarters, it would be 'True'.
- If there is no such data or if the claim is exaggerated, it would be 'False'.

Given the ambiguity and lack of specific data, the most balanced assessment would be 'Half True', acknowledging that there might be some basis for the claim but also recognizing the potential for exaggeration or misinterpretation.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"In Rustavi, people's owned playground is dismantled for personal purposes",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In Rustavi, people's owned playground is dismantled for personal purposes,"" we would need to verify specific details such as:

1. Whether a playground in Rustavi was indeed dismantled.
2. Whether the playground was owned by the people (public property).
3. Whether the dismantling was done for personal purposes (private gain).

Without concrete evidence or reliable sources to confirm these details, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that there is no available evidence to support the claim, the most cautious approach would be to consider it unverified.

There is a two -year retardation for the plan for the construction of the highway and the funds ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There is a two-year retardation for the plan for the construction of the highway and the funds,"" we need to verify two key points:

1. Whether there is indeed a two-year delay in the construction plan for the highway.
2. Whether the delay also applies to the allocation or availability of funds for the project.

Without specific evidence or data to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some factual information but lacks complete context or verification, we might consider it to be partially accurate.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"The number of acquittals has increased.In 2016 there were 429 such verdicts, and administrative ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The number of acquittals has increased. In 2016 there were 429 such verdicts, and administrative ..."", we need to verify the following:

1. Whether the number of acquittals has indeed increased over time.
2. The specific number of acquittals in 2016, which is stated as 429.

Without additional data or context about the number of acquittals in years following 2016, it is not possible to definitively confirm or refute the claim that the number of acquittals has increased. The statement provides a specific number for 2016 but does not provide comparative data for subsequent years to support the claim of an increase.

Given the lack of comparative data, the claim cannot be fully verified or falsified based on the information provided.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Giorgi Kvirikashvili has never been in parliament since his approval,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Giorgi Kvirikashvili has never been in parliament since his approval,"" we need to consider Giorgi Kvirikashvili's political career and roles. Giorgi Kvirikashvili served as the Prime Minister of Georgia from December 30, 2015, to June 13, 2018. Before becoming Prime Minister, he held various ministerial positions, including Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

However, being a Prime Minister or a minister does not necessarily mean one is a member of parliament. In Georgia, the Prime Minister is appointed by the President and approved by the Parliament, but the Prime Minister does not have to be a member of parliament.

Given this context, if the claim is specifically about Kvirikashvili's presence in parliament as a member since his approval as Prime Minister, it is important to note that he was not a member of parliament during his tenure as Prime Minister.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
"More than 1.7 billion salary expenses, reducing it by 20%means increasing the pension by 50 GEL",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the components and verify the calculations.

1. **Initial Salary Expenses**: The claim states that the salary expenses are more than 1.7 billion. For simplicity, let's assume the salary expenses are exactly 1.7 billion GEL.

2. **Reduction by 20%**: Reducing 1.7 billion by 20% means calculating 20% of 1.7 billion and then subtracting it from the original amount.
   - 20% of 1.7 billion = 0.20 * 1,700,000,000 = 340,000,000 GEL.
   - Reduced salary expenses = 1,700,000,000 - 340,000,000 = 1,360,000,000 GEL.

3. **Savings from Reduction**: The savings from the reduction would be 340,000,000 GEL.

4. **Increasing Pension by 50 GEL**: To understand the impact of increasing pensions by 50 GEL, we need to know the number of pensioners. Let's denote the number of pensioners as \( P \).

5. **Total Cost of Pension Increase**: The total cost of increasing pensions by 50 GEL per pensioner would be \( 50 \times P \).

To verify the claim, we need to check if the savings (340,000,000 GEL) can cover the total cost of the pension increase.

- If \( 50 \times P \leq 340,000,000 \), then the claim is feasible.
- Solving for \( P \):
  \[
  P \leq \frac{340,000,000}{50} = 6,800,000
  \]

So, if the number of pensioners is 6.8 million or fewer, the claim holds true. If the number of pensioners exceeds 6.8 million, the claim would be false.

Given that the number of pensioners in a country like Georgia is likely to be significantly less than 6.8 million, the claim appears to be feasible.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"The Georgian Dream has cut off the country, more unemployed, more debt to our budget",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Georgian Dream has cut off the country, more unemployed, more debt to our budget,"" we need to analyze each part of the statement:

1. **""The Georgian Dream has cut off the country""**: This part of the claim is vague and could be interpreted in several ways. If it means isolating the country internationally, we would need to look at Georgia's current diplomatic and trade relations. If it means internal policies that have isolated certain regions or communities, we would need specific examples.

2. **""More unemployed""**: This can be verified by looking at unemployment statistics over the period that the Georgian Dream party has been in power. If unemployment rates have increased, this part of the claim could be true.

3. **""More debt to our budget""**: This can be verified by examining the national debt levels and budget deficits during the tenure of the Georgian Dream party. If the national debt has increased, this part of the claim could be true.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data, let's break it down:

- **Cut off the country**: Without specific context, this is hard to verify definitively.
- **More unemployed**: Requires unemployment data.
- **More debt**: Requires national debt data.

Assuming we have access to reliable data sources:

- If Georgia's international relations have not significantly deteriorated, this part could be considered **False**.
- If unemployment has increased, this part could be **True**.
- If national debt has increased, this part could be **True**.

Given the mixed nature of the claim and the need for specific data to verify each part, the overall claim could be considered **Half True** if some parts are accurate and others are not.

"Session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, which is held in Georgia, so far in non-nonsense states ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. Whether a session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly has been held in Georgia.
2. The context of ""non-nonsense states"" and whether Georgia fits this description.

1. **NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Georgia**: The NATO Parliamentary Assembly has indeed held sessions in Georgia. For example, the NATO PA held its Spring Session in Tbilisi, Georgia, in May 2017.

2. **Non-nonsense states**: This term is subjective and not a standard classification. It could imply countries that are serious, stable, and committed to NATO's values and objectives. Georgia, while not a NATO member, has been a strong partner and has contributed to NATO missions, indicating a serious commitment to NATO's principles.

Given these points, the claim that a session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly has been held in Georgia is accurate. The term ""non-nonsense states"" is ambiguous but can be interpreted in a way that includes Georgia due to its active partnership with NATO.

"Foreign investments also have a disadvantage, investors are delivering a dividend, today if we see that 2013 ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and evaluate each part:

1. ""Foreign investments also have a disadvantage"" - This is a general statement that can be considered true because, like any investment, foreign investments come with their own set of risks and disadvantages, such as political risk, currency risk, and differences in regulatory environments.

2. ""investors are delivering a dividend"" - This part of the statement is somewhat vague. If it means that investors are receiving dividends from their investments, then it is generally true that many foreign investments can yield dividends. However, not all foreign investments necessarily deliver dividends, as it depends on the type of investment and the specific company or asset.

3. ""today if we see that 2013 ..."" - This part of the statement is incomplete and lacks context. It is unclear what specific point is being made about the year 2013, making it difficult to evaluate its truthfulness.

Given the incomplete and somewhat vague nature of the statement, it is challenging to fully assess its accuracy. However, based on the information provided:

This would involve checking the official budget reports or financial statements for the specified year to confirm the amounts spent on operational costs of vehicles and representative costs.

Without access to these specific financial documents, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided and the lack of verifiable sources, I cannot confirm the accuracy of the statement.

"Kaladze's ""Success"" is a good investment in the field of energy, investing during his ministry ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Kaladze's 'Success' is a good investment in the field of energy, investing during his ministry,"" we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding Kaladze's tenure and achievements in the energy sector.

Kakha Kaladze served as the Minister of Energy in Georgia from 2012 to 2017. During his tenure, there were several initiatives and projects aimed at improving the energy sector, including efforts to increase energy independence, develop renewable energy sources, and modernize infrastructure. However, the success and impact of these initiatives can be subjective and may vary based on different perspectives and metrics.

To accurately assess the claim, we would need to consider:
1. Specific projects and investments made during Kaladze's ministry.
2. The outcomes and measurable impacts of these projects.
3. Expert opinions and evaluations of his tenure.
4. Any criticisms or shortcomings identified during his time in office.

Without detailed evidence and a comprehensive analysis of these factors, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general information available, it appears that there were notable efforts and some positive outcomes in the energy sector during his ministry, but the extent of their success and the overall return on investment may be debated.

“The number of people living in poverty has been substantially reduced and this figure is virtually updated ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The number of people living in poverty has been substantially reduced and this figure is virtually updated,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Global Poverty Trends**: According to data from the World Bank and other international organizations, global poverty has indeed seen a significant reduction over the past few decades. For example, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty (defined as living on less than $1.90 a day) has decreased from around 36% in 1990 to about 9% in recent years.

2. **Recent Data**: The claim mentions that the figure is ""virtually updated."" This implies that the data is current and reflects recent trends. While global poverty has been on a downward trend, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a temporary setback, with millions of people falling back into poverty due to economic disruptions.

3. **Regional Variations**: While global figures show a reduction, the situation can vary significantly by region. Some areas, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, still have high poverty rates, and progress has been slower compared to other regions like East Asia and the Pacific.

4. **Measurement and Definitions**: The definition of poverty and the methods used to measure it can affect the interpretation of the data. Extreme poverty is often measured by income, but other dimensions such as access to education, healthcare, and living standards are also important.

Given these considerations, the claim that the number of people living in poverty has been substantially reduced is generally accurate, but the statement about the figure being ""virtually updated"" might be slightly overstated given the recent impacts of the pandemic and regional disparities.

"According to the regulations, the Minister is obliged to appear at a meeting with the faction in parliament",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the specific regulations or laws governing the obligations of a Minister in relation to parliamentary meetings. In many parliamentary systems, ministers are indeed required to appear before parliament or its committees to answer questions and provide information. However, the exact nature of this obligation can vary depending on the country's specific parliamentary rules and regulations.

For example, in the United Kingdom, ministers are generally expected to attend parliamentary sessions and committee meetings when summoned, but there may be exceptions or specific conditions under which they are required to appear. In other parliamentary systems, the rules might be different.

Without specific information about the regulations in question, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given the general expectation in many parliamentary systems for ministers to appear before parliament, the claim leans towards being accurate.

"In 2018, tourist flow flow to Adjara increased by 16%, as well as the number of visitors to 124%...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific statistics regarding the increase in tourist flow and the number of visitors to Adjara in 2018. 

1. **Tourist Flow Increase**: The claim states that the tourist flow to Adjara increased by 16% in 2018.
2. **Number of Visitors Increase**: The claim also states that the number of visitors increased by 124% in 2018.

Without access to the specific data from reliable sources such as government tourism reports or reputable news articles, it is challenging to confirm the exact figures. However, the claim seems inconsistent because a 16% increase in tourist flow and a 124% increase in the number of visitors are significantly different metrics. Typically, ""tourist flow"" and ""number of visitors"" would be closely related, and such a large discrepancy between the two figures is unusual.

Given the inconsistency and the lack of specific data to verify the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is not accurate as stated.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The reports of international organizations say that Georgia's integration process with Pro ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The reports of international organizations say that Georgia's integration process with Pro ..."", we need to consider the context and the specific international organizations being referenced. 

1. **European Union (EU)**: Georgia has been actively pursuing closer ties with the EU. The EU-Georgia Association Agreement, which includes a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), was signed in 2014. Reports from the EU have generally been positive about Georgia's progress, although they often highlight areas needing improvement.

2. **NATO**: Georgia has also been seeking NATO membership. NATO reports have acknowledged Georgia's contributions to international security and its reforms, but full membership has not yet been granted, partly due to geopolitical concerns.

3. **Other International Organizations**: Various other international organizations, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have also reported on Georgia's economic reforms and integration into the global economy.

Given this context, the claim that ""The reports of international organizations say that Georgia's integration process with Pro ..."" is generally supported by evidence from multiple sources, though the specifics of ""Pro ..."" are unclear. If ""Pro ..."" refers to ""progress"" or ""prosperity,"" the claim aligns with the positive but cautious reports from these organizations.

1. The existence of the ""Kartu"" foundation.
2. Whether the ""Kartu"" foundation is involved in the restoration project of Vardzia.
3. The involvement of Sapari K in the project.

Without additional context or sources, it is challenging to verify these specific details. However, the ""Kartu"" foundation is known to be a charitable organization in Georgia, often involved in cultural and historical restoration projects. Vardzia is a well-known cave monastery site in Georgia, and it is plausible that a foundation like ""Kartu"" could be involved in its restoration.

Given the lack of specific information about ""Sapari K"" and the exact details of the project, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted.

2. Whether 81 people died in such accidents in 2010.
3. The context or location referred to by ""Kh ..."".

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to verify the exact number of fatalities in production accidents in 2010. However, if we assume ""Kh ..."" refers to a specific location or industry, we would need detailed records from that area or sector.

Given the lack of specific information and context, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim.

1. The number of officers at the Ministry of Education.
2. The amount of bonuses they receive.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these details, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some factual information but may be exaggerated or lacking context, we can make an educated guess.

Given that the claim states ""more than 120 officers"" and ""millions of GEL bonuses,"" it is possible that the number of officers is accurate but the amount of bonuses might be exaggerated or not clearly defined.

"""This project was not announced [Panorama Tbilisi] and the Sololaki Range is already being cut""",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the project ""Panorama Tbilisi"" was announced or not.
2. Whether the Sololaki Range is already being cut.

1. **Announcement of Panorama Tbilisi:**
   - Panorama Tbilisi is a large-scale development project in Tbilisi, Georgia. It has been a subject of public discussion and media coverage since its announcement. The project was officially announced and has been covered by various news outlets and public forums.

2. **Cutting of the Sololaki Range:**
   - The Sololaki Range is a part of the area affected by the Panorama Tbilisi project. There have been reports and evidence of construction activities, including cutting and altering the landscape in the Sololaki Range as part of the development process.

Given these points, the claim that the project was not announced is incorrect, but the claim that the Sololaki Range is already being cut is correct.

"After the change of government, shore protection works were suspended in Batumi",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""After the change of government, shore protection works were suspended in Batumi,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. **Change of Government**: Confirm if there was indeed a change of government in Batumi or the relevant governing body.
2. **Shore Protection Works**: Establish if there were ongoing shore protection works in Batumi prior to the change of government.
3. **Suspension of Works**: Verify if these shore protection works were suspended following the change of government.

Without specific information or sources to confirm these points, it is not possible to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable events and there is no contradictory evidence, we might lean towards a preliminary assessment.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the most cautious and accurate response would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The 2015 budget has been exaggerated and this is the merit of the government,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The 2015 budget has been exaggerated and this is the merit of the government,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. Whether the 2015 budget has indeed been exaggerated.
2. Whether this exaggeration is a merit of the government.

Without specific data or context about the 2015 budget, it's challenging to definitively assess whether the budget was exaggerated. Exaggeration implies that the budget figures were overstated or inflated beyond what was realistic or necessary. This would require a detailed analysis of the budget figures, economic conditions, and comparisons to previous budgets or actual expenditures.

Assuming the budget was exaggerated, the second part of the claim suggests that this exaggeration is a merit of the government. Typically, exaggeration is not considered a merit, as it implies a lack of transparency or accuracy. Merits are usually positive attributes or achievements, and exaggeration would generally be viewed negatively.

Given the lack of specific evidence and the generally negative connotation of exaggeration, the claim appears to be misleading.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The State Department has directly linked the case of Rustavi 2 to Euro-Atlantic integration,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The State Department has directly linked the case of Rustavi 2 to Euro-Atlantic integration,"" we need to examine statements and actions from the U.S. State Department regarding Rustavi 2, a prominent television station in Georgia, and its connection to Euro-Atlantic integration.

1. **Background on Rustavi 2**: Rustavi 2 has been a significant media outlet in Georgia, often seen as a platform for opposition voices. Its ownership and editorial independence have been subjects of legal and political disputes.

2. **U.S. State Department's Position**: The U.S. State Department has expressed concerns about media freedom and judicial independence in Georgia, which are critical components of democratic governance and, by extension, Euro-Atlantic integration. However, whether the State Department has made a direct and explicit link between the Rustavi 2 case and Euro-Atlantic integration needs to be verified through official statements or documents.

3. **Statements and Reports**: If the State Department has issued statements or reports explicitly stating that the Rustavi 2 case is directly linked to Georgia's Euro-Atlantic integration, this would support the claim. If the connection is more implicit or part of broader concerns about democratic principles, the claim might be less accurate.

Based on available information, the U.S. State Department has indeed expressed concerns about media freedom and judicial independence in Georgia, which are relevant to Euro-Atlantic integration. However, a direct and explicit link between the Rustavi 2 case and Euro-Atlantic integration in official statements is less clear.

Facebook has never mentioned the Georgian Dream,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Facebook has never mentioned the Georgian Dream,"" we need to consider the context and the nature of Facebook as a platform. Facebook is a social media platform where users, pages, and organizations can post content. It is highly unlikely that Facebook, as a company or platform, has never had any mention of ""Georgian Dream,"" which is a political party in Georgia. Users, news organizations, and other entities on Facebook have likely mentioned it.

Given the widespread use of Facebook and the nature of the platform, it is highly improbable that there has been no mention of the Georgian Dream at all.

"Gas into Ude and Arali and lit up, at the end of the year the population will be completely gasified",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Gas into Ude and Arali and lit up, at the end of the year the population will be completely gasified,"" we need to evaluate several factors:

1. **Verification of Gas Supply to Ude and Arali**: Confirm whether gas has indeed been supplied to these locations.
2. **Current Status of Gasification**: Assess the current level of gasification in these areas.
3. **Feasibility of Complete Gasification by Year-End**: Evaluate whether it is realistic to achieve complete gasification of the population by the end of the year.

Without specific data or evidence to support these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given the ambitious nature of the statement and the typical complexities involved in infrastructure projects, it is prudent to approach the claim with skepticism unless there is strong supporting evidence.

City Hall will definitely have to go through the competition for those employees who have passed the exam,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""City Hall will definitely have to go through the competition for those employees who have passed the exam,"" we need to consider the context and typical procedures involved in hiring processes for government positions.

1. **Government Hiring Practices**: In many government settings, passing an exam is often just one step in the hiring process. Candidates who pass the exam may still need to go through additional steps, such as interviews, background checks, and other forms of evaluation.

2. **Use of the Word 'Definitely'**: The word ""definitely"" implies that there are no exceptions and that this process is guaranteed. However, hiring processes can vary based on specific regulations, policies, and the needs of the City Hall.

3. **Competition**: The term ""competition"" suggests that there are multiple candidates vying for the same positions, which is common in government hiring. However, the necessity of competition can depend on the number of available positions and the number of qualified candidates.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat accurate but not absolute. There are nuances and potential exceptions that the claim does not account for.

"In 2015, government debt deteriorated in relation to the country's economy ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In 2015, government debt deteriorated in relation to the country's economy,"" we need to examine the data on government debt and economic performance for that year.

1. **Global Context**: In 2015, many countries experienced varying degrees of economic performance and changes in government debt levels. For instance, some countries in the Eurozone were still recovering from the debt crisis, while others like the United States saw improvements in their economic indicators.

2. **Specific Country Data**: Without specifying a particular country, it's challenging to make a definitive statement. However, if we consider major economies:
   - **United States**: The U.S. saw a reduction in its budget deficit in 2015, but the overall debt level remained high relative to GDP.
   - **Eurozone**: Some countries like Greece continued to struggle with high debt levels, while others saw stabilization or improvement.
   - **Emerging Markets**: Countries like Brazil faced economic downturns, which likely led to a deterioration in debt-to-GDP ratios.

3. **General Trend**: On a global scale, the trend in 2015 was mixed. Some countries improved their debt situations, while others saw deterioration.

Given the variability and the lack of specificity in the claim, it is difficult to assert a universal truth. However, considering that several significant economies did experience challenges with their debt levels in relation to their economic performance, the claim holds some validity.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"During the United National Movement, the budget increased 6 times at the expense of foreign debt """,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""During the United National Movement, the budget increased 6 times at the expense of foreign debt,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: The United National Movement (UNM) was a political party in Georgia that came to power after the Rose Revolution in 2003 and remained influential until around 2012.

2. **Budget Growth**: We need to verify if the national budget of Georgia indeed increased sixfold during the period when the UNM was in power.

3. **Source of Funding**: It is crucial to determine whether this budget increase was primarily due to foreign debt or other sources such as economic growth, increased tax revenues, or foreign aid.

Without specific data on the budget figures and the breakdown of funding sources during the UNM's tenure, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the budget did increase significantly, we still need to verify the claim that this increase was mainly due to foreign debt.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, the claim appears to be an oversimplification. It is likely that multiple factors contributed to the budget increase, not solely foreign debt.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
"Balance balance deficit reduced to 8.7%, this with the stability of the GEL rate ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Balance balance deficit reduced to 8.7%, this with the stability of the GEL rate,"" we need to verify two key points:

1. Whether the balance deficit has indeed been reduced to 8.7%.
2. Whether the GEL (Georgian Lari) rate has remained stable.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the balance deficit reduction to 8.7% is accurate and that the GEL rate has remained stable, the claim could be considered accurate. 

Given the lack of specific data to verify these points, the most cautious and reasonable classification would be 'Half True,' as it acknowledges that the claim could be partially correct but lacks full verification.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Problem of gasification and water supply in the villages of Gori municipality ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Problem of gasification and water supply in the villages of Gori municipality,"" we need to consider the context and available data regarding the infrastructure and services in Gori municipality.

1. **Gasification**: Gasification refers to the process of supplying natural gas to households and businesses. In many rural areas, including those in Gori municipality, there can be challenges related to the infrastructure required for gas supply. This can include the lack of pipelines, financial constraints, and logistical issues.

2. **Water Supply**: Access to clean and reliable water supply is a common issue in many rural areas. Problems can arise from outdated infrastructure, insufficient water sources, and maintenance issues.

Given that rural areas often face challenges with both gasification and water supply, it is reasonable to assume that the villages in Gori municipality might experience similar issues. However, without specific data or reports confirming the extent of these problems in Gori municipality, it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim.

Based on general knowledge and the common issues faced by rural areas, the claim seems plausible but not definitively confirmed.

One of the lowest rates of corruption in Georgia and many European states in this regard ...,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that Georgia has ""one of the lowest rates of corruption in Georgia and many European states in this regard,"" we need to refer to reliable sources that measure corruption levels, such as Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).

1. **Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)**: This index ranks countries based on perceived levels of public sector corruption. As of the latest available data, Georgia has made significant progress in reducing corruption and is often ranked relatively well compared to many other countries, including some European states.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: While Georgia has improved its ranking, it is still not among the very top countries with the lowest corruption rates globally or in Europe. Many Western European countries, such as Denmark, Finland, and Switzerland, consistently rank higher in terms of lower corruption levels.

Given this context, the claim that Georgia has ""one of the lowest rates of corruption in Georgia and many European states in this regard"" is somewhat exaggerated. While Georgia does perform well compared to some countries, it is not among the very lowest in Europe.

Zurab Japaridze points to problems in the 2013 state budget spending,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Zurab Japaridze points to problems in the 2013 state budget spending,"" we need to verify whether Zurab Japaridze indeed made such statements and whether there were recognized issues with the 2013 state budget spending.

1. **Verification of Statement**: 
   - Zurab Japaridze is a Georgian politician known for his critical stance on various governmental issues. If there are records or credible sources indicating that he specifically pointed out problems in the 2013 state budget spending, this would support the claim.

2. **Context of the 2013 State Budget**:
   - The 2013 state budget of Georgia might have had issues that were publicly discussed or criticized by various political figures, including Japaridze. If there were documented problems or controversies surrounding the budget, this would further substantiate the claim.

Given the need for specific evidence to confirm both Japaridze's statements and the existence of problems in the 2013 budget, the claim's accuracy hinges on these factors.

Without direct evidence or sources at hand, but considering the plausibility based on Japaridze's known political activities and the likelihood of budgetary issues being a topic of discussion, the claim seems reasonably credible.

We are 114th in the world's level of life.So we were at Shevardnadze and Saakashvili's time.,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are 114th in the world's level of life. So we were at Shevardnadze and Saakashvili's time,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Ranking**: The claim states a specific ranking (114th) in the world's level of life. This could refer to various indices such as the Human Development Index (HDI), Quality of Life Index, or other similar metrics. We need to verify the current ranking of the country in question (presumably Georgia, given the reference to Shevardnadze and Saakashvili).

2. **Historical Comparison**: The claim also states that the ranking was the same during the times of Eduard Shevardnadze (President of Georgia from 1995 to 2003) and Mikheil Saakashvili (President of Georgia from 2004 to 2013). We need historical data to verify if the ranking was indeed 114th during their respective terms.

### Verification:

1. **Current Ranking**: As of the latest available data, Georgia's ranking in the Human Development Index (HDI) for 2021 is 63rd. This is significantly higher than 114th.

2. **Historical Data**: During Shevardnadze's and Saakashvili's terms, Georgia's HDI ranking varied. For instance, in 2000, Georgia's HDI ranking was around 100th, and by 2010, it had improved to around 74th. These rankings are also not consistent with the claim of being 114th.

### Conclusion:

The claim that ""We are 114th in the world's level of life"" is not supported by current data, and the historical comparison to Shevardnadze's and Saakashvili's times is also inaccurate. Therefore, the claim is:

2. Whether they received bonuses.
3. The amount of the bonuses they received, specifically if it was 200,000.

Ian Kelly's statement by some media outlets in the case of Rustavi 2 has been misinterpreted,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Ian Kelly's statement by some media outlets in the case of Rustavi 2 has been misinterpreted,"" we would need to examine the original statement made by Ian Kelly, the context in which it was made, and how various media outlets reported it. Misinterpretation implies that the media outlets presented the statement in a way that deviates from its original meaning or intent.

Without specific details on the original statement and the media reports in question, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if there is evidence that media outlets reported the statement in a way that significantly altered its meaning or context, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. Conversely, if the media reports were largely accurate and consistent with the original statement, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I cannot definitively assess the claim. However, based on the general nature of such disputes, it is reasonable to assume that there might be some degree of misinterpretation involved.

“David Narmania Ministry [Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure] approximately 130 ...,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""David Narmania Ministry [Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure] approximately 130 ..."", we need to verify the context and the specific details surrounding David Narmania's role and any relevant statistics or information related to the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure.

1. **David Narmania's Role**: David Narmania served as the Minister of Regional Development and Infrastructure of Georgia.
2. **Context of the Claim**: The claim mentions ""approximately 130"" but does not provide specific details about what this number refers to (e.g., projects, budget, personnel, etc.).

Without additional context or specific details, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, based on the information provided:

- David Narmania did indeed serve in the mentioned ministry.
- The number ""130"" lacks context, making it difficult to assess its accuracy.

Given the lack of specific details and context, the claim cannot be fully verified or debunked.

This year's GDP growth is due to the fact that there was a very low growth last year ... GDP growth in recent years ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""This year's GDP growth is due to the fact that there was a very low growth last year ... GDP growth in recent years ..."", we need to consider the following points:

1. **Base Effect**: When a year with low GDP growth is followed by a year with higher growth, the increase can partly be attributed to the base effect. This means that the percentage increase appears larger because it is calculated from a smaller base.

2. **Other Factors**: GDP growth can be influenced by a variety of factors including government policies, consumer spending, investment, and external economic conditions. Therefore, attributing this year's GDP growth solely to last year's low growth might be an oversimplification.

3. **Contextual Data**: Without specific data on the GDP growth rates for the years in question, it is difficult to definitively assess the claim. However, the base effect is a well-known economic phenomenon that can contribute to higher growth rates following a period of low growth.

Given these considerations, the claim has some validity but is not entirely comprehensive. It acknowledges the base effect but does not account for other potential contributing factors to GDP growth.

Prices for important consumption products have increased,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Prices for important consumption products have increased,"" we need to consider recent economic data and trends. Generally, prices for consumption products can be influenced by various factors such as inflation, supply chain disruptions, and changes in demand.

As of recent years, many countries have experienced inflationary pressures, leading to an increase in the prices of various goods and services, including important consumption products like food, fuel, and household items. This trend has been widely reported and documented by economic analysts and institutions.

Given this context, the claim appears to be supported by current economic conditions.

The Ministry of Environment should be a separate standing structure.The obligation to do this as an Association Agreement ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Ministry of Environment should be a separate standing structure. The obligation to do this as an Association Agreement ..."", we need to consider the context and specific details of any relevant Association Agreement.

An Association Agreement is typically a treaty between the European Union (EU) and a non-EU country that creates a framework for cooperation between them. These agreements often cover a wide range of areas, including political dialogue, trade, and regulatory alignment, but the specific obligations can vary significantly from one agreement to another.

If the claim is referring to an Association Agreement with the EU, it is important to verify whether such an agreement explicitly mandates the establishment of a separate Ministry of Environment. Generally, Association Agreements may encourage or require certain environmental standards and regulatory frameworks, but they do not usually dictate the specific administrative structures that a country must adopt.

Without specific evidence from the text of the relevant Association Agreement that explicitly states the requirement for a separate Ministry of Environment, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

"“Unlike previous years, in 2013, the private sector played a role in the economy.Village meu ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Unlike previous years, in 2013, the private sector played a role in the economy,"" we need to consider historical economic data and trends.

1. **Historical Context**: The private sector has been a significant part of the economy in many countries for decades. The extent of its role can vary based on the country and its economic policies.

2. **2013 Economic Trends**: In 2013, many countries around the world continued to see significant involvement from the private sector. For instance, in the United States, the private sector has always been a major driver of the economy. In emerging markets, the private sector's role has been growing over the years, but it was not unique to 2013.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: The claim suggests that the private sector's involvement in 2013 was a new development compared to previous years. This is generally not accurate for most economies, as the private sector has been integral for a long time.

Given this context, the claim that the private sector played a role in the economy in 2013 ""unlike previous years"" is misleading. The private sector has been playing a role in the economy for many years prior to 2013.

“In Spain for just one suicide when a Spanish woman was evicted ...,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In Spain for just one suicide when a Spanish woman was evicted,"" we need to consider the context and the specific details surrounding the event. 

1. **Context**: The claim suggests that there was a single suicide incident related to an eviction in Spain. 
2. **Verification**: We would need to verify if there was indeed a documented case of a Spanish woman committing suicide due to eviction and if it was the only such case reported.

Without specific details or evidence to confirm or refute the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a well-documented incident, it might be partially accurate but potentially misleading if there have been other similar incidents.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, the most cautious and balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"The Prosecutor's Office was interested in my election registration documentation, which has nothing to do with pardon ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and the specifics of the situation. The claim states that the Prosecutor's Office was interested in election registration documentation and implies that this has no connection to a pardon.

1. **Interest in Election Registration Documentation**: If the Prosecutor's Office indeed showed interest in the election registration documentation, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Connection to Pardon**: The claim asserts that the election registration documentation has nothing to do with a pardon. This would depend on the specific circumstances of the case. If there is no direct or indirect link between the election registration documentation and the pardon, then this part of the claim would also be true.

Without additional context or evidence to suggest a connection between the election registration documentation and a pardon, we can evaluate the claim based on the information provided.

"""European Parliaments are eager to make the opposition more constructive and cooperate with the government""",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""European Parliaments are eager to make the opposition more constructive and cooperate with the government,"" we need to consider the general practices and trends within European parliamentary systems.

1. **Constructive Opposition**: Many European parliamentary systems do encourage a constructive opposition. This means that while the opposition parties critique the government, they also aim to provide alternative solutions and engage in meaningful debate. This is seen as a way to improve governance and policy-making.

2. **Cooperation with Government**: The level of cooperation between the opposition and the government can vary significantly depending on the country, the political culture, and the specific issues at hand. In some countries, there is a tradition of coalition governments and cross-party cooperation, while in others, the political environment may be more adversarial.

3. **Institutional Mechanisms**: Some European parliaments have institutional mechanisms in place to facilitate cooperation and constructive opposition. For example, committees often include members from both the government and opposition parties, and there are procedures for opposition parties to propose legislation or amendments.

4. **Recent Trends**: In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of constructive opposition in many European countries. This is partly due to the increasing complexity of policy issues and the need for broad-based support to address challenges such as economic crises, climate change, and public health emergencies.

Given these points, the claim has a basis in reality but may not be universally applicable to all European parliaments or in all contexts. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but reflects a general trend.

"Now 4,000 cars are sold in Rustavi a month, but in 2010-2012 this figure will be 10 thousand ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the sales figures for cars in Rustavi for the years 2010-2012. The claim states that 4,000 cars are sold in Rustavi per month currently, and it predicts that this figure will increase to 10,000 cars per month in the years 2010-2012.

1. **Current Sales**: The claim states that 4,000 cars are sold per month currently. Without specific data, we cannot verify this part of the claim.
2. **Future Prediction**: The claim predicts that the sales will increase to 10,000 cars per month in the years 2010-2012. Since we are currently past the year 2012, we can check historical data to verify this prediction.

Given that we are now past 2012, we can look at historical data to see if the prediction was accurate. If historical data shows that car sales in Rustavi did indeed reach 10,000 cars per month during 2010-2012, the claim would be accurate. If not, the claim would be false.

However, without access to specific historical sales data for Rustavi, we cannot definitively verify the accuracy of the prediction. Therefore, based on the information provided and the need for historical data verification, we can conclude that the claim is speculative and lacks sufficient evidence.

"State enterprises are stolen, more than a billion GEL was the loss in 2017",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""State enterprises are stolen, more than a billion GEL was the loss in 2017,"" we need to evaluate two main components:

1. **State enterprises are stolen**: This part of the claim suggests that there is significant corruption or misappropriation of state-owned enterprises. This would require evidence of widespread theft or corruption within state enterprises.

2. **More than a billion GEL was the loss in 2017**: This part of the claim specifies a financial loss amounting to over a billion Georgian Lari (GEL) in the year 2017. This would require financial records or reports indicating such a loss.

Without specific evidence or data to support these claims, it is challenging to verify their accuracy. However, if there are credible reports or audits from 2017 that document such losses and instances of corruption or theft within state enterprises, the claim could be substantiated.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, and assuming no additional context or data is available, the claim appears to be an overgeneralization and lacks concrete evidence.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"""Absurd to health insurance does not actually cover anything""",mostly false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Absurd to health insurance does not actually cover anything,"" we need to consider the general purpose and function of health insurance.

Health insurance is designed to cover a range of medical expenses, including doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, prescription medications, and preventive care. The extent of coverage can vary significantly depending on the specific insurance plan, the provider, and the policyholder's choices. While some plans may have high deductibles, copayments, or exclusions for certain treatments, it is not accurate to say that health insurance ""does not actually cover anything.""

There are certainly cases where individuals may feel that their insurance does not provide adequate coverage, especially if they face high out-of-pocket costs or if certain treatments are not covered. However, this does not mean that health insurance, in general, fails to cover any medical expenses.

"IDPs are building the road at their own expense, and the local authorities have been able to withdraw bonuses ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are indeed building the road at their own expense.
2. Local authorities have been able to withdraw bonuses as a result.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that there is some truth to both parts but not enough detailed evidence to fully support them, the claim might be considered partially accurate.

However, the provided statement is vague and lacks specific details that can be verified. It does not provide enough information about what ""legalized lands"" refers to, what process was started, or any context that would allow for a clear verification.

Given the lack of specific information and context, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim as 'True', 'Mostly True', 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

"Irakli Khakhubia, a sponsor of the National Movement, today is ""Dream""",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Irakli Khakhubia, a sponsor of the National Movement, today is 'Dream',"" we need to verify the following:

1. Whether Irakli Khakhubia was indeed a sponsor of the National Movement.
2. Whether he is currently associated with 'Dream' (presumably referring to the Georgian Dream party).

Without specific and verifiable information on these points, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim, it suggests a change in political affiliation or support from the National Movement to the Georgian Dream party.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the claim, and assuming no additional context or verification is available, the safest assessment would be to consider the claim as unverified and potentially misleading.

1. The actual number of wine bottles exported in April.
2. The percentage increase compared to the previous year.

Without access to the specific data on wine exports for both the current and previous years, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate, the claim would be considered 'True'. 

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, I cannot definitively categorize it. Therefore, based on the information provided:

"In Avchala, Utseri Street has long been in need of rehabilitation.Residents are asking for help from City Hall ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. Whether Utseri Street in Avchala has indeed been in need of rehabilitation for a long time.
2. Whether residents have been asking for help from City Hall regarding this issue.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on actual resident reports and observable conditions of the street, it could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the question, but assuming the claim is based on genuine concerns from residents, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
"For the first time, artificial skiing took place, which increased the season to 5 months",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""For the first time, artificial skiing took place, which increased the season to 5 months,"" we need to evaluate two main components:

1. Whether it was indeed the first time artificial skiing took place.
2. Whether this event increased the skiing season to 5 months.

Without specific historical context or additional information, it's challenging to verify the exact timing of the first instance of artificial skiing. However, artificial skiing (using artificial snow) has been around for several decades, so it is unlikely that this is the first time it has occurred.

Regarding the extension of the skiing season to 5 months, artificial snow can indeed extend the skiing season, but the exact duration would depend on various factors such as location, climate, and technology used.

Given the lack of specific details and the historical context of artificial skiing, the claim seems to be an overstatement.

Administration Salary Fund does not grow,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Administration Salary Fund does not grow,"" we need to consider various factors such as historical data, budget allocations, and any relevant policies or economic conditions that might affect the growth of the fund.

1. **Historical Data**: If historical data shows that the Administration Salary Fund has remained constant over a significant period, the claim could be considered true. However, if there have been increases, even if minor, the claim would be less accurate.

2. **Budget Allocations**: Government or organizational budgets often undergo changes due to inflation, policy changes, or other economic factors. If the budget for the Administration Salary Fund has been adjusted over time, this would indicate growth.

3. **Economic Conditions**: Inflation and cost-of-living adjustments typically lead to increases in salary funds over time. If the Administration Salary Fund has been adjusted for these factors, it would suggest growth.

Without specific data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given that most salary funds are subject to periodic adjustments, it is unlikely that the fund has not grown at all.

"Financing of medicines does not include universal health care, and the prices of medicines for almost the third time ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and evaluate each part:

1. ""Financing of medicines does not include universal health care"":
   - This statement suggests that the financing mechanisms for medicines are separate from universal health care systems. In many countries with universal health care, the cost of medicines is often covered or subsidized as part of the overall health care system. However, there are also countries where medicines may not be fully covered under universal health care, requiring additional out-of-pocket expenses or separate insurance.

2. ""the prices of medicines for almost the third time ..."":
   - This part of the statement is incomplete and lacks context. It seems to imply that the prices of medicines have increased significantly, but without additional information, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of this claim.

Given the incomplete nature of the second part of the statement and the variability in how medicines are financed in different health care systems, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted based on the provided information.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
“Prices for medicines have increased by 25%.Medications are one of the most disadvantages of healthcare ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Prices for medicines have increased by 25%. Medications are one of the most disadvantages of healthcare,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Prices for medicines have increased by 25%.""
2. ""Medications are one of the most disadvantages of healthcare.""

For the first part, the accuracy of the statement depends on the specific timeframe and context. If there is verifiable data showing that medicine prices have indeed increased by 25% over a certain period, then this part could be true. However, without specific data or a defined timeframe, it's difficult to confirm this claim.

For the second part, ""Medications are one of the most disadvantages of healthcare,"" this is a subjective statement. The term ""disadvantages"" is vague and can be interpreted in various ways. Medications can be seen as a disadvantage due to high costs, side effects, or accessibility issues, but they are also a crucial part of healthcare for treating and managing diseases.

Given the lack of specific data and the subjective nature of the second part, the overall claim is not fully verifiable.

"Billions are spent on defense and NATO projects.Georgia's defense needs 600 million, with 400 million ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. ""Billions are spent on defense and NATO projects.""
2. ""Georgia's defense needs 600 million, with 400 million ...""

### Analysis:

1. **Billions are spent on defense and NATO projects:**
   - This statement is generally true. NATO member countries collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars annually on defense. For example, the United States alone spends over $700 billion on defense annually, and NATO as a whole has significant defense expenditures.

2. **Georgia's defense needs 600 million, with 400 million ...:**
   - This part of the claim is more specific and requires verification. Georgia, the country, has a defense budget that is significantly smaller than major NATO countries. According to recent data, Georgia's defense budget is indeed in the range of several hundred million dollars. For instance, in recent years, Georgia's defense budget has been around $300-400 million. The exact figure of $600 million might be an estimate or a projected need rather than the current budget.

### Conclusion:
- The first part of the claim is accurate.
- The second part of the claim is somewhat accurate but may not reflect the most current or precise figures.

Given the information, the claim is not entirely accurate but has elements of truth.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
We received 140.7 million GEL in privatization in 8 months,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We received 140.7 million GEL in privatization in 8 months,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The source of the claim: Who made this statement? Is it from a reliable and authoritative source such as a government report, official statement, or a credible news outlet?
2. The time frame: Does the 8-month period mentioned align with the reported data?
3. The amount: Is the figure of 140.7 million GEL accurate according to official records or reports?

Without access to specific data or reports, I cannot verify the claim directly. However, if the claim is made by a credible source and aligns with available data, it could be considered accurate.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"By my order, the Hauptwachts were abolished in the Georgian army",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""By my order, the Hauptwachts were abolished in the Georgian army,"" we need to consider historical context and specific details.

1. **Hauptwachts**: This term is German and typically refers to a main guard or a central watch, often used in military contexts.
2. **Georgian Army**: Refers to the military forces of Georgia, a country in the Caucasus region.

Given the German term ""Hauptwachts,"" it is unlikely that this term would be used in the context of the Georgian army, which would more likely use its own language or Russian terms due to historical influences.

Additionally, there is no widely known historical record or evidence that specifically mentions the abolition of ""Hauptwachts"" in the Georgian army by any particular order. 

Therefore, without specific historical evidence or context to support this claim, it is not accurate.

2. **Exports Value**: 3,771.5 million
3. **Context**: Record rate in recent decades

Without additional context or specific data sources, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the information provided:

- The claim states that exports reached a record rate of 3,771.5 million in 2019.
- It also mentions that this is a record in recent decades.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact figures and context, the claim appears to be somewhat specific but lacks comprehensive verification.

Three times reduced the rate of pre -trial detention,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Three times reduced the rate of pre-trial detention,"" we need to consider the context and the data available. The claim suggests that the rate of pre-trial detention has been reduced by a factor of three. 

To evaluate this, we would need:
1. Baseline data on the rate of pre-trial detention before the reduction efforts.
2. Data showing the rate of pre-trial detention after the reduction efforts.
3. Verification that the reduction is indeed threefold.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, if we assume that the claim is based on reliable data and context, it could be considered accurate. 

Given the lack of specific data in the question, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

"“In 2014, remuneration has really increased by 220 million, but the police, the police, Samama ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details mentioned:

1. **Year (2014)**: The claim refers to the year 2014.
2. **Remuneration Increase**: The claim states that remuneration increased by 220 million.
3. **Context (Police)**: The claim mentions the police, implying that the remuneration increase is related to police salaries or budgets.

Without specific data or context to verify these details, it is challenging to determine the exact truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the structure and the lack of clear context or supporting evidence, it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy.

"Funding for the CSU does not grow, it was allocated for four months",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Funding for the CSU does not grow, it was allocated for four months,"" we need to evaluate two components:

1. Whether the funding for the CSU (California State University) does not grow.
2. Whether the funding was allocated for only four months.

1. **Funding Growth**: Historically, funding for the CSU system can vary from year to year based on state budgets, economic conditions, and legislative decisions. It is not accurate to make a blanket statement that funding does not grow, as there have been periods of both increases and decreases in funding.

2. **Four-Month Allocation**: Typically, funding for public universities like the CSU is allocated on an annual basis as part of the state budget process. A four-month allocation would be highly unusual and would likely be part of a specific, temporary measure rather than a standard practice.

Given these points, the claim appears to be misleading on both counts. Funding for the CSU can grow, and it is generally allocated on an annual basis, not just for four months.

Currently 2 232 apartments are under construction for IDPs,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Currently 2,232 apartments are under construction for IDPs,"" I would need to verify the information from reliable sources such as government reports, official statements, or credible news articles. 

Since I don't have access to real-time data or specific sources, I can't definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to verify it:

1. **Check Government Announcements**: Look for recent announcements from the relevant government department or agency responsible for housing or IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) affairs.
2. **News Reports**: Search for recent news articles that report on housing projects for IDPs.
3. **Official Websites**: Visit the official websites of organizations involved in housing for IDPs to see if they have published any updates or reports.

Without access to these sources, I can't provide a definitive answer.

Population affected by frost in Shida Kartli did not help the authorities,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Population affected by frost in Shida Kartli did not help the authorities,"" we need to evaluate the available evidence and context. This involves checking if there are any official reports, news articles, or statements from authorities or credible sources that confirm or deny the claim.

1. **Official Reports**: If there are official reports from the government or local authorities stating that they did not provide help to the population affected by frost in Shida Kartli, this would support the claim.
2. **News Articles**: News articles from reputable sources that cover the situation in Shida Kartli and mention the lack of assistance from authorities would also support the claim.
3. **Statements from Authorities**: Any statements from local or national authorities acknowledging that they did not provide help would be relevant.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm or deny the claim, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that no such evidence is available or if the claim is based on anecdotal reports without substantial proof, we might lean towards a more cautious evaluation.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted. Therefore, the most appropriate response based on the information at hand would be:

"Compared to 2012, budget revenue has increased by 50%, which means that Georgian citizens ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Compared to 2012, budget revenue has increased by 50%, which means that Georgian citizens ..."", we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the budget revenue of Georgia has indeed increased by 50% compared to 2012.
2. The implication that this increase directly affects Georgian citizens in a specific way, which is not fully stated in the claim.

First, let's look at the budget revenue data. If the budget revenue in 2012 was X, a 50% increase would mean the budget revenue in the current year is 1.5X. We would need to check official financial records or credible sources to confirm this percentage increase.

Second, the claim implies a direct benefit or impact on Georgian citizens due to the increase in budget revenue. However, without additional context or specifics about how the increased revenue is being utilized (e.g., public services, infrastructure, social programs), it's not possible to definitively state the impact on citizens.

Given the lack of specific information about the direct impact on citizens and assuming the budget revenue increase is accurate, the claim is partially verifiable but lacks complete context.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Georgia is in fifth place in the Budget Transparency Ranking,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgia is in fifth place in the Budget Transparency Ranking,"" we need to verify the most recent and reliable sources that provide such rankings. The Open Budget Index (OBI) by the International Budget Partnership (IBP) is a widely recognized source for assessing budget transparency.

1. **Check the Latest Open Budget Index Report**: The most recent OBI report should be consulted to see where Georgia ranks.
2. **Verify the Year of the Report**: Ensure that the ranking is from the latest available report to provide the most accurate information.
3. **Cross-Reference with Other Sources**: If possible, cross-reference with other reputable sources or reports on budget transparency.

As of the latest available data from the Open Budget Index (OBI) 2021, Georgia was ranked 5th in the world for budget transparency. This ranking is based on the comprehensive assessment of the availability, timeliness, and comprehensiveness of budget documents.

According to the World Bank and other reliable economic sources, Georgia's GDP growth rate in 2014 was approximately 4.6%. This figure is below the 5% threshold mentioned in the claim.

Given this information, the claim that Georgia's economic growth in 2014 would exceed 5% is not accurate.

"Kutaisi residents will cost City Hall cars up to GEL 800,000 this year",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Kutaisi residents will cost City Hall cars up to GEL 800,000 this year,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The budget allocation for City Hall cars in Kutaisi for the current year.
2. Whether the amount allocated is indeed up to GEL 800,000.
3. If the cost is directly attributed to the residents of Kutaisi.

If the budget documents or official statements confirm that the City Hall has allocated up to GEL 800,000 for cars this year, and this cost is considered to be borne by the residents (through taxes or other means), then the claim would be accurate.

Without specific data or official confirmation, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the information is based on a reliable source, we can make an educated assessment.

"In the 21st century, in the second largest city, Kutaisi, with four-hour graphics there is water",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. **21st Century Context**: The claim is set in the 21st century.
2. **Location**: The second largest city in Georgia is Kutaisi.
3. **Water Supply**: The claim states that there is water available in Kutaisi with four-hour graphics (likely meaning scheduled water supply for four hours).

**Verification**:

1. **21st Century Context**: We are currently in the 21st century, so this part of the claim is accurate.
2. **Location**: Kutaisi is indeed the second largest city in Georgia, after Tbilisi.
3. **Water Supply**: Historically, Kutaisi has faced issues with water supply, and there have been periods where water was available only at scheduled times. However, recent improvements in infrastructure have aimed to provide more consistent water supply. The specific claim about ""four-hour graphics"" suggests a scheduled water supply, which may have been true at certain times but is not necessarily a current or consistent situation.

Given that the claim may have been true at certain points in the 21st century but does not necessarily reflect the current situation, it is not entirely accurate but has elements of truth.

We have lost 300 million GEL by achieving 3%economic growth,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have lost 300 million GEL by achieving 3% economic growth,"" we need to analyze several factors:

1. **Economic Growth Context**: Economic growth is generally measured by the increase in a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A 3% economic growth indicates that the economy has expanded by 3% over a specific period.

2. **Loss of 300 Million GEL**: The claim suggests a loss of 300 million Georgian Lari (GEL) despite achieving economic growth. This could imply that certain sectors or areas of the economy experienced a decline or that there were specific financial losses that offset the overall growth.

3. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - **Sectoral Decline**: It's possible that while the overall economy grew, certain sectors (e.g., agriculture, manufacturing) might have faced downturns, leading to financial losses.
   - **Inflation or Currency Devaluation**: If inflation rates were high or the currency devalued, the real value of economic growth might be less significant, potentially leading to perceived losses.
   - **Government Expenditure**: Increased government spending or investment to stimulate growth might result in a temporary financial deficit or loss.

4. **Data Verification**: To accurately assess the claim, we would need specific data on the Georgian economy, including GDP growth figures, sectoral performance, inflation rates, and government financial statements.

Without concrete data to support the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, the notion of ""losing"" money while achieving economic growth is counterintuitive unless specific adverse conditions are present.

**Conclusion**: Given the lack of detailed data and the general economic principle that growth typically indicates an overall increase in economic activity and value, the claim appears to be misleading.

1. Whether the remuneration of 51 thousand GEL was indeed not received.
2. Whether the figure of 51 thousand GEL is considered inflated.

Without additional context or evidence to verify these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the phrasing, it suggests that the claim is disputing the receipt of the amount and labeling it as inflated.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support or refute the claim, the most balanced assessment would be:

This would include official reports, water quality tests, and feedback from residents.

Without specific data or evidence, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that there are no widespread reports of water quality issues and that the local water supply meets national and international standards, the claim could be considered accurate.

"According to Giorgi Kakauridze, the annual increase in excise tax on tobacco is associated with the EU ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim made by Giorgi Kakauridze regarding the annual increase in excise tax on tobacco being associated with the EU, we need to consider the context and details of the relationship between Georgia and the European Union.

Georgia has an Association Agreement with the EU, which includes a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). Part of this agreement involves aligning certain regulations and standards with those of the EU, which can include excise taxes on products like tobacco. The EU has specific directives on tobacco taxation that member states and associated countries are encouraged to follow to ensure public health and market stability.

Given this context, it is reasonable to conclude that the annual increase in excise tax on tobacco in Georgia is indeed influenced by its commitments under the Association Agreement with the EU.

"By democratic standards, our country is much more preceding in the post -Soviet space.Will it be the media in itself ...",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""By democratic standards, our country is much more preceding in the post-Soviet space,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Democratic Standards**: This typically refers to the level of political freedom, fair elections, rule of law, freedom of the press, and civil liberties.
2. **Post-Soviet Space**: This includes countries that were part of the Soviet Union before its dissolution in 1991.

Countries in the post-Soviet space vary significantly in their democratic standards. For example, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are often considered to have higher democratic standards compared to others like Belarus or Turkmenistan.

Without specifying which country is being referred to, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the country in question is one of the more democratic ones in the post-Soviet space (e.g., Estonia), the claim could be considered 'Mostly True'. If the country is one with moderate democratic standards (e.g., Ukraine or Georgia), it might be 'Half True'. If the country is one with lower democratic standards (e.g., Belarus), the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information about the country in question, the most balanced assessment would be 'Half True', acknowledging that some countries in the post-Soviet space do have higher democratic standards, while others do not.

Kutaisi City Hall did not know if the white bridge was on the list of cultural heritage sites,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Kutaisi City Hall did not know if the white bridge was on the list of cultural heritage sites,"" we need to evaluate the available evidence or statements from reliable sources.

If there is evidence or a statement from Kutaisi City Hall indicating uncertainty or lack of knowledge about the white bridge's status on the cultural heritage list, the claim would be considered true or mostly true. Conversely, if there is evidence that Kutaisi City Hall was aware of the bridge's status, the claim would be false or mostly false.

Without specific evidence or statements to reference, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the phrasing of the claim, it suggests a lack of knowledge or uncertainty on the part of Kutaisi City Hall.

This would involve checking recent reports, government announcements, or reliable sources that provide updates on gasification in these areas.

Without access to the latest data or specific sources confirming the status of gasification in Martvili, Tsalenjikha, and Chkhorotsku, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and accurate information, it could be considered accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"In fact, tourism is the only growing sector in our economy today",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In fact, tourism is the only growing sector in our economy today,"" we need to consider the current economic data and trends across various sectors. 

1. **Economic Data**: Economic growth is typically measured by GDP, employment rates, and sector-specific performance indicators. 
2. **Sector Analysis**: Other sectors such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy have shown significant growth in recent years.
3. **Geographical Context**: The claim might be more accurate in certain regions or countries where tourism is a major economic driver, but globally, multiple sectors are experiencing growth.

Given the complexity and variability of economic growth across different sectors and regions, it is highly unlikely that tourism is the only growing sector in any diversified economy.

"Interest rates during the previous government were 21%, which is reduced by 3 times",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Interest rates during the previous government were 21%, which is reduced by 3 times,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. Interest rates during the previous government were 21%.
2. The interest rates have been reduced by 3 times.

First, let's consider the interest rate of 21% during the previous government. This is a specific historical fact that would need to be verified against historical interest rate data for the country in question. If this is accurate, then the first part of the claim is true.

Second, the phrase ""reduced by 3 times"" is somewhat ambiguous. If it means that the interest rate has been reduced to one-third of its original value, then the new interest rate would be 21% / 3 = 7%. If the current interest rate is indeed 7%, then this part of the claim would also be true.

However, if the current interest rate is not 7%, or if the original interest rate was not 21%, then the claim would be false or at least misleading.

Without specific historical data to verify these points, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim. Assuming the data provided is accurate, the claim would be logically consistent.

“Nika Gilauri was meant to be a Ukrainian business ombudsman ... The Georgian government sent a note and told him ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Nika Gilauri was meant to be a Ukrainian business ombudsman ... The Georgian government sent a note and told him ..."", we need to verify the following:

1. Whether Nika Gilauri was indeed considered or appointed as a Ukrainian business ombudsman.
2. Whether the Georgian government sent a note to him regarding this matter.

Nika Gilauri is a former Prime Minister of Georgia, and there have been instances where former officials from one country are considered for positions in another. However, specific details about his appointment as a Ukrainian business ombudsman and any communication from the Georgian government would need to be verified through credible sources such as news reports, official statements, or other reliable documentation.

Without access to specific and verifiable information confirming both parts of the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize the statement. However, based on the general knowledge available up to the cutoff date, there is no widely known or documented instance of Nika Gilauri being appointed as a Ukrainian business ombudsman and the Georgian government sending a note to him about it.

"Russia, in The Hague, uses quotes from Salome Zourabichvili's book as an argument against Georgia",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Russia, in The Hague, uses quotes from Salome Zourabichvili's book as an argument against Georgia,"" we need to verify if there is credible evidence or reports confirming that Russia has indeed used quotes from Salome Zourabichvili's book in its arguments against Georgia in The Hague.

Salome Zourabichvili is a Georgian politician and diplomat who has written books, and it is possible that her writings could be referenced in various contexts. However, without specific evidence or reports confirming that Russia has used her book in this particular manner, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the claim itself, and without additional verification from reliable sources, it is prudent to approach this claim with caution.

A country where the barrier is 5%and the winner brings all the barriers to the sounds of the,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down and analyze its components:

1. ""A country where the barrier is 5%"": This could refer to an electoral threshold, which is a common feature in many proportional representation electoral systems. In some countries, political parties must receive a minimum percentage of the vote (often 5%) to gain representation in the legislature.

2. ""the winner brings all the barriers to the sounds of the"": This part of the claim is unclear and seems to be incomplete or nonsensical. It does not provide a coherent or verifiable statement.

Given that the second part of the claim is not clear or meaningful, it is difficult to assess the overall truthfulness of the entire statement. The first part about the 5% barrier is plausible and true for some countries, but the second part does not make sense.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Tbilisi City Council transferred 16 590 sq.m land to the Patriarchate from January 2017 to July 2017,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the Tbilisi City Council transferred 16,590 sq.m of land to the Patriarchate from January 2017 to July 2017, we would need to verify the specific records and official documents from the Tbilisi City Council for that period. This would include checking council meeting minutes, land transfer records, and any public announcements or press releases regarding land transfers to the Patriarchate.

Without access to these specific records, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified information from reliable sources, we can tentatively assess it.

Given the lack of direct evidence provided here, I cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, based on the information available:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"During the previous government there was an average of 10 km on the highway a year, and today 28 km every year ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the data regarding highway construction during the previous government and the current government. This involves checking the average kilometers of highway built per year during both periods.

1. **Previous Government**: Verify if the average highway construction was indeed 10 km per year.
2. **Current Government**: Verify if the average highway construction is currently 28 km per year.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these figures, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the figures provided are accurate based on available data, we can make an assessment.

Given the information provided and assuming the figures are correct:

- If the previous government averaged 10 km per year and the current government averages 28 km per year, the claim would be accurate.

"""Exports have increased significantly ... we have had an export reduction in recent years""",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the two parts of the statement:

1. ""Exports have increased significantly...""
2. ""...we have had an export reduction in recent years.""

These two parts are contradictory. If exports have increased significantly, it would not be accurate to say there has been an export reduction in recent years. Conversely, if there has been an export reduction in recent years, it would not be accurate to say exports have increased significantly.

Given the inherent contradiction, the claim cannot be fully true or mostly true. It also cannot be half true because the two parts directly oppose each other.

"""A swampy lake has emerged on the territory of abandoned construction in Avlabari, Avlabari""",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""A swampy lake has emerged on the territory of abandoned construction in Avlabari, Avlabari,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. The existence of an abandoned construction site in Avlabari.
2. The emergence of a swampy lake on that site.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible report or observation, we might lean towards a certain level of truth.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the question, the most cautious and reasonable approach would be to consider the claim as 'Half True'—acknowledging that it could be partially accurate but lacking full verification.

One of the reasons for the depreciation of the GEL is foreign debts accumulated by the previous government,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""One of the reasons for the depreciation of the GEL is foreign debts accumulated by the previous government,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Foreign Debt Impact**: Foreign debt can indeed impact a country's currency value. High levels of foreign debt can lead to concerns about a country's ability to repay, which can weaken investor confidence and lead to depreciation of the currency.

2. **Other Factors**: Currency depreciation is typically influenced by a multitude of factors, including but not limited to economic performance, inflation rates, political stability, and global market conditions. Focusing solely on foreign debt may oversimplify the issue.

3. **Historical Context**: The specific impact of the previous government's actions, including the accumulation of foreign debt, would need to be assessed in the context of other concurrent economic policies and global economic conditions.

Given that foreign debt is one of many factors that can contribute to currency depreciation, and assuming the claim does not account for other significant factors, the statement is partially accurate but not wholly comprehensive.

This phrase is ambiguous and could be interpreted in various ways, such as referring to three locations, three founders, or three main services.

Without additional context or clarification, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, based on the information provided, there is no clear evidence or widely known fact that supports the idea that ""Kutaisi Cleaning Service"" is associated with ""three seats"" in any specific manner.

If the data shows that exports to China in 2017 were indeed over $200 million, the claim would be 'True'. If the exports were close to but not exactly $200 million, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the exports were significantly less than $200 million, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False' depending on how far off the figure is.

Without the specific export data for 2017, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data is accurate based on the context provided:

The ministry has never had 2 billion l,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The actual budget allocated to the ministry in 2019.
2. Historical budget allocations to the same ministry in previous years.

If the 2019 allocation is indeed 2 billion lari and no previous year had such an allocation, the claim would be 'True'. If the allocation is close to 2 billion but not exactly, or if there were previous years with similar allocations, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the allocation is significantly less or if there were previous years with higher allocations, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data on the budget allocations, we can only make an educated guess based on the information provided. However, for a definitive answer, we would need to look at the budget records.

4. Any relevant data or records that support or refute the claim.

Without additional context or specific details, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that a state would be given property of 5,634 people free of charge without significant documentation or public record.

"In 2008, out of 18,000 cases, the court issued an acquittal of only one",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In 2008, out of 18,000 cases, the court issued an acquittal of only one,"" we need to verify the specific data regarding court acquittals for that year. This involves checking reliable sources such as judicial reports, legal databases, or credible news articles that provide statistics on court cases and acquittals for 2008.

Without access to specific data or sources, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is about a specific court or jurisdiction, it would be highly unusual for a court to have such a low acquittal rate (1 out of 18,000 cases). Typically, acquittal rates, while often low, are not usually as extreme as 1 in 18,000.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, and considering the improbability of such an extreme acquittal rate, the claim seems highly suspect.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"""Transparency International"" speaks for thousands of people, more than 7,000 people ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and the specifics of Transparency International's operations and reach.

Transparency International is a global organization that works to combat corruption and promote transparency, accountability, and integrity at all levels of society. It has a significant presence worldwide, with chapters in over 100 countries and a large network of volunteers, supporters, and staff.

The claim states that Transparency International ""speaks for thousands of people, more than 7,000 people."" Given the organization's extensive network and the number of people involved in its activities, it is reasonable to assert that it represents the interests and voices of thousands of individuals globally.

However, the specific figure of ""more than 7,000 people"" is somewhat arbitrary and may not accurately reflect the total number of people directly associated with or represented by Transparency International. The organization likely has a much larger reach and influence.

"“For more than 20 years, Georgia's economy has been stagnated instead of development.What an argument ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""For more than 20 years, Georgia's economy has been stagnated instead of development,"" we need to examine economic data and trends for Georgia over the past two decades.

1. **Economic Growth**: According to data from the World Bank and other economic sources, Georgia has experienced significant economic growth since the early 2000s. The country has implemented various reforms to improve its business environment, which has attracted foreign investment and boosted economic development.

2. **GDP Trends**: Georgia's GDP has generally been on an upward trajectory, with some fluctuations due to global economic conditions and regional instability. For example, the GDP growth rate was quite high in the mid-2000s, although it did experience a slowdown during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. **Reforms and Development**: The country has made substantial progress in areas such as ease of doing business, governance, and infrastructure development. These reforms have contributed to economic growth and development.

4. **Challenges**: While Georgia has made significant strides, it still faces challenges such as unemployment, poverty, and regional disparities. However, these issues do not negate the overall trend of economic development.

Given this information, the claim that Georgia's economy has been stagnated for more than 20 years is not accurate. The country has seen periods of robust economic growth and development, despite some challenges.

Reduction of remuneration moves on the shoulders of Georgian soldiers,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Reduction of remuneration moves on the shoulders of Georgian soldiers,"" we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding it. This involves understanding whether there has been a reduction in the remuneration (pay or benefits) of Georgian soldiers and if this reduction has been a significant burden on them.

1. **Verification of Remuneration Reduction**: 
   - If there is concrete evidence or official statements indicating that the remuneration of Georgian soldiers has been reduced, this part of the claim would be true.
   
2. **Impact on Soldiers**:
   - If the reduction has indeed placed a significant burden on the soldiers, such as financial hardship or decreased morale, then the claim would be more accurate.

Without specific evidence or context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that there is some basis to the claim but lack detailed evidence on the extent and impact, a cautious approach would be to rate it as partially accurate.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False

1. ""Pension reform has taken place"": This part of the claim can be evaluated based on whether there have been recent changes or reforms in the pension system. If there have been significant reforms, this part would be true.

2. ""Applying from the pension scheme is practically minimized"": This part of the claim suggests that the process of applying for pensions has been significantly reduced or simplified. This would require evidence that the application process has been streamlined or that fewer people are applying due to the reforms.

Without specific details or evidence about the pension reforms and their impact on the application process, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, if we assume that some reforms have taken place but the extent to which the application process has been minimized is unclear, the claim might be partially accurate.

Without specific evidence or context, it is challenging to definitively confirm or deny this claim. However, if there is any record of Giorgi Gachechiladze discussing social heritage and describing it as ""heavy,"" then the claim would be true. Conversely, if there is no such record, the claim would be false.

The term ""unprecedentedly"" implies that the increase is the highest ever recorded or significantly higher than any previous increases.

Without access to the specific data and historical context, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified data, it could be considered true. Conversely, if there is no supporting data or if the increase is not as significant as claimed, it could be false.

Ossetian patients for treatment from Tskhinvali to Georgian clinics are reduced to patients and with their special services ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and available evidence regarding the treatment of Ossetian patients from Tskhinvali in Georgian clinics.

1. **Historical Context**: Tskhinvali is the capital of South Ossetia, a region with a complex political status and history of conflict between Georgia and separatist forces. Access to medical services can be influenced by political and logistical factors.

2. **Medical Access**: There have been instances where patients from South Ossetia have been treated in Georgian clinics, often facilitated by humanitarian efforts or special agreements. However, the frequency and conditions under which this occurs can vary.

3. **Current Situation**: The claim suggests a reduction in the number of Ossetian patients being treated in Georgian clinics, which could be due to various reasons such as political tensions, improved local healthcare, or logistical challenges.

4. **Special Services**: The mention of ""special services"" could imply that specific arrangements or programs are in place to facilitate the treatment of these patients, which might be true in some cases.

Given the complexity and variability of the situation, the claim appears to be partially accurate but lacks specific details and context.

A contactless patrol system that we are introducing is a practice introduced in Europe,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A contactless patrol system that we are introducing is a practice introduced in Europe,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Existence of Contactless Patrol Systems in Europe**: Contactless patrol systems, which often involve the use of technology such as GPS, RFID, or mobile apps to monitor and manage patrol activities without physical interaction, have indeed been implemented in various European countries. These systems are used in security, law enforcement, and other sectors to enhance efficiency and safety.

2. **Introduction of the Practice**: The claim suggests that the practice of contactless patrol systems originated in Europe. While Europe has been a significant adopter and innovator in this field, it is not necessarily the origin of the concept. Similar technologies and systems have been developed and implemented in other parts of the world, including North America and Asia.

Given that contactless patrol systems are indeed used in Europe but the claim implies that Europe is the origin of the practice, which is not definitively true, the claim is somewhat overstated.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
We have a very large shortage of electricity that grows every year,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have a very large shortage of electricity that grows every year,"" we need to consider several factors, including the current state of electricity supply and demand, regional variations, and trends over recent years.

1. **Current State of Electricity Supply and Demand**: In many parts of the world, electricity supply and demand are closely monitored and managed. Some regions may experience shortages due to various factors such as infrastructure issues, natural disasters, or economic growth outpacing supply. However, other regions may have surplus electricity or sufficient capacity to meet demand.

2. **Regional Variations**: The situation can vary significantly from one region to another. For example, developing countries or regions with rapid industrial growth may face more significant challenges in meeting electricity demand compared to developed countries with established infrastructure.

3. **Trends Over Recent Years**: The claim suggests that the shortage is growing every year. This would require consistent data showing an increasing gap between electricity supply and demand over multiple years. In some regions, investments in renewable energy, grid improvements, and energy efficiency measures have helped to mitigate shortages.

Given these considerations, the claim may hold true in specific contexts but is not universally applicable. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate to generalize this statement without specifying the context.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"More than 160 million in agro insurance to insure the vintage, 80-90% of the crop is protected from hail",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""More than 160 million in agro insurance to insure the vintage, 80-90% of the crop is protected from hail,"" we need to verify two main points:

1. The amount of agro insurance provided.
2. The percentage of the crop protected from hail.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these details, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and current information, we can analyze it as follows:

- ""More than 160 million in agro insurance to insure the vintage"" suggests a significant investment in agricultural insurance.
- ""80-90% of the crop is protected from hail"" indicates a high level of coverage for hail damage.

Given that both parts of the claim seem plausible but lack specific verification, the most appropriate response would be to consider it as partially accurate but not fully confirmed.

2. ""It will allow him to do so during the previous government ...""

First, we need to verify if the gas tariff in Senaki was indeed increased by the company. This would require checking recent news or official announcements from the gas company operating in Senaki.

Second, the phrase ""It will allow him to do so during the previous government ..."" is ambiguous and unclear. It seems to suggest that some permission or policy from the previous government is enabling the current action, but it is not specific about what ""it"" or ""him"" refers to.

Given the lack of clarity and specific information in the second part of the claim, it is difficult to fully verify its accuracy. Therefore, the claim as a whole is not entirely clear or verifiable based on the provided information.

"Three years ago, by reducing the tariff, our population saved up to GEL 150 million.This is the amount they are ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the following aspects:

1. **Time Frame**: The claim specifies ""three years ago."" We need to verify if there was indeed a tariff reduction three years ago.
2. **Tariff Reduction**: We need to confirm if there was a reduction in tariffs and what kind of tariffs were reduced (e.g., import tariffs, utility tariffs, etc.).
3. **Savings**: The claim states that the population saved up to GEL 150 million. We need to check if there are any official reports or credible sources that support this figure.

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some official statement or report, we can make an educated guess.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, but assuming it might be based on some factual basis, we might categorize it as:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The government has not used the anti -hail device,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The government has not used the anti-hail device,"" we would need to verify whether the government in question has indeed utilized such a device. This would involve checking official records, statements, or credible reports regarding the use of anti-hail technology by the government.

Without specific information or evidence to confirm or refute the claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that there is no evidence available to suggest that the government has used the anti-hail device, the claim could be considered 'True'. Conversely, if there is evidence that the government has used the device, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information provided in the question, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. Therefore, I will base my response on the assumption that no evidence of use has been presented.

Almost half of the hotels in Georgia were created under the power of the Georgian Dream,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Almost half of the hotels in Georgia were created under the power of the Georgian Dream,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Timeframe of Georgian Dream's Power**: The Georgian Dream party has been in power since 2012.
2. **Hotel Industry Growth**: We need data on the number of hotels built before and after 2012.
3. **Reliable Sources**: We should look for credible sources such as government reports, industry analyses, or reputable news articles that provide statistics on hotel construction in Georgia.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the hotel industry has seen significant growth since 2012 and that a substantial number of hotels have been built during this period, the claim could be plausible.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted. Therefore, the most appropriate classification based on the available information would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"When the number of taxes decreased, under these conditions the budget and economy were increasing",mostly true,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""When the number of taxes decreased, under these conditions the budget and economy were increasing,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: There have been instances where tax cuts have led to economic growth, such as the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s. However, the relationship between tax cuts and economic growth is complex and influenced by many variables, including the state of the economy, how the tax cuts are structured, and how they are financed.

2. **Economic Theory**: According to supply-side economics, reducing taxes can stimulate economic growth by increasing disposable income for consumers and investment capital for businesses. However, this theory is debated among economists, and the outcomes can vary.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Empirical studies show mixed results. Some studies suggest that tax cuts can lead to short-term economic growth, but the long-term effects on the budget deficit and overall economy can be negative if the tax cuts are not offset by spending cuts or other revenue increases.

4. **Budget Impact**: Decreasing taxes can lead to a reduction in government revenue, which might increase the budget deficit unless accompanied by a corresponding decrease in government spending. The impact on the budget and economy depends on how these changes are managed.

Given these considerations, the claim is an oversimplification. While there are scenarios where tax cuts have coincided with economic growth, it is not universally true and depends on various conditions and how the tax policy is implemented.

The problem of water supply in Kutaisi was unresolved.We started with intense work as a result of which…,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The problem of water supply in Kutaisi was unresolved. We started with intense work as a result of which…"", we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding the water supply situation in Kutaisi and the efforts made to address it.

1. **Unresolved Water Supply Problem**: If there is historical or recent evidence indicating that Kutaisi had significant issues with its water supply, this part of the claim could be considered true.

2. **Intense Work and Results**: The second part of the claim suggests that intense work was initiated to address the water supply problem. To verify this, we would need information on specific projects, initiatives, or efforts undertaken to improve the water supply in Kutaisi and whether these efforts led to tangible results.

Without specific evidence or detailed information, it is challenging to fully validate the claim. However, based on the structure of the statement and assuming there is some basis for the water supply issues and subsequent efforts, the claim could be considered partially accurate.

"Only 16 million GEL per year is spent on funding for psychiatry.For years, funding for psychiatry ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Only 16 million GEL per year is spent on funding for psychiatry,"" we would need to verify the actual budget allocated for psychiatry in the relevant region or country. This information is typically available through government health department reports, official budget documents, or credible news sources.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the figure of 16 million GEL is accurate based on available data, the claim would be considered 'True'. If the figure is close but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the figure is significantly different, it could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to the relevant budget information and it confirms the 16 million GEL figure, you can use that to determine the accuracy.

Final Answer: Unable to determine without specific data.",,False,True
"“There is an increase in growth per capita GDP, it has not stopped… why we do not pay attention to this fact ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and the data available on per capita GDP growth. Per capita GDP growth can vary significantly by country and over different time periods. 

1. **Global Perspective**: On a global scale, per capita GDP has generally increased over the long term, although there are periods of stagnation or decline, such as during economic recessions or crises.

2. **Country-Specific Data**: For individual countries, the growth in per capita GDP can be quite different. Some countries may experience consistent growth, while others may face economic challenges that lead to stagnation or decline.

3. **Recent Trends**: In recent years, many countries have seen fluctuations in per capita GDP growth due to various factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused significant economic disruptions worldwide.

Given these considerations, the claim that ""There is an increase in growth per capita GDP, it has not stopped"" is a general statement that may not hold true universally for all countries and all time periods. However, if we interpret it as referring to a long-term global trend, it is more likely to be accurate.

"“The government, this bureaucracy, which is now taxpayers in power, cost 1 ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the statement in its entirety and context. However, the provided text is incomplete: ""The government, this bureaucracy, which is now taxpayers in power, cost 1 ...""

"“After the March constitutional amendment, investments have not increased, trade has not increased except exports ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""After the March constitutional amendment, investments have not increased, trade has not increased except exports,"" we would need to examine specific data on investments, trade, and exports following the amendment in question. This would involve looking at economic reports, trade statistics, and investment data from credible sources such as government reports, financial institutions, and economic research organizations.

Without access to this specific data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information, we can analyze it as follows:

1. **Investments**: If data shows that investments have remained stagnant or decreased since the amendment, this part of the claim would be true.
2. **Trade**: If overall trade (imports and exports combined) has not increased but exports specifically have increased, this part of the claim would also be true.

Given the structure of the claim, it is making two separate assertions:
- Investments have not increased.
- Trade has not increased except for exports.

If both assertions are supported by data, the claim would be 'True'. If only one part is supported, it would be 'Half True'. If neither part is supported, it would be 'False'.

Final Answer: Without specific data to verify the claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize it. However, based on the structure and assuming the information is accurate, the most appropriate response would be 'Half True' if only one part is correct, or 'True' if both parts are correct.

Published by statistics according to which the criminal is clearly reduced compared to previous years,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Published by statistics according to which the criminal is clearly reduced compared to previous years,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of Statistics**: The credibility of the source publishing the statistics is crucial. Are these statistics from a reliable and recognized institution such as a government agency, reputable research organization, or academic study?

2. **Time Frame**: The claim mentions ""previous years,"" but it does not specify how many years back we are comparing. A reduction over one year might be different from a reduction over a decade.

3. **Type of Crime**: The claim does not specify which types of crime are being referred to. Some types of crime may have decreased while others may have increased.

4. **Geographical Scope**: The claim does not specify the geographical area. Crime rates can vary significantly from one region to another.

Without specific details and verification from a credible source, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the statistics are from a reliable source and cover a broad range of crimes over a significant period, the claim could be considered plausible.

Given the lack of specific details and the need for verification, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False

Without additional context or specific information about which National Movement is being referred to, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.

However, if we assume this refers to a specific political party or movement in a particular country, we would need to check historical records to confirm whether the National Movement was indeed not in power for nine years and whether this affected infrastructure development.

Given the lack of specific context and details, it is not possible to accurately verify the claim.

In international assessments all reforms of Georgia and the course spent by the authorities are endorsed,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In international assessments all reforms of Georgia and the course spent by the authorities are endorsed,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **International Assessments**: Various international organizations and assessments evaluate the reforms and policies of countries, including Georgia. These can include reports from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), European Union (EU), and other international bodies.

2. **Reforms and Course of Authorities**: Georgia has undertaken numerous reforms in areas such as governance, economic policy, anti-corruption measures, and judicial reforms. The reception of these reforms can vary widely among different international bodies and assessments.

3. **Endorsement**: Endorsement implies a positive evaluation or approval. It is unlikely that all reforms and the overall course of the authorities would receive unanimous approval from all international assessments, as these bodies often have different criteria and perspectives.

Given the diversity of international assessments and the complexity of reforms, it is improbable that every single reform and the overall course of the authorities in Georgia would be universally endorsed without any criticism or reservations.

Our attitudes on the money received from Russia are reduced,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Our attitudes on the money received from Russia are reduced,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Clarity**: The statement is somewhat vague. It is unclear what is meant by ""attitudes"" and how they are being ""reduced."" Are we talking about public opinion, governmental stance, or something else?

2. **Evidence and Data**: Without specific data or context, it is difficult to measure changes in attitudes. If there is evidence showing a decline in positive sentiment or reliance on money from Russia, that would support the claim. Conversely, if there is no such evidence or if attitudes have not changed, the claim would be false.

3. **Current Events and Trends**: If recent events or policies have led to a reduction in the acceptance or reliance on money from Russia, this could support the claim. For example, sanctions or political shifts could influence attitudes.

Given the lack of specific context and evidence provided in the claim, it is challenging to definitively assess its accuracy. However, based on the general ambiguity and the need for more precise information, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"According to the two quarters, the budget is exceeded and the failure is virtually not observed",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""According to the two quarters, the budget is exceeded and the failure is virtually not observed,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""According to the two quarters, the budget is exceeded.""
2. ""The failure is virtually not observed.""

Without specific data or context about the budget and failure rates for the two quarters in question, it's challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, we can analyze the logical consistency and typical scenarios.

1. If the budget is indeed exceeded, it means that the actual spending has surpassed the allocated budget for those two quarters.
2. If failure is ""virtually not observed,"" it implies that there are very few or no significant failures reported during the same period.

Given that the claim combines two separate observations (budget and failure rates) without providing specific data, we can only assess it based on the general plausibility of such a scenario occurring together.

Since the claim could be plausible but lacks specific evidence, it is reasonable to categorize it as ""Half True.""

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
Georgia's data in the Global Competitiveness Index improved by 7 positions.138 countries ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgia's data in the Global Competitiveness Index improved by 7 positions among 138 countries,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The specific year or period in question for the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) report.
2. The actual ranking of Georgia in the GCI for the specified years.
3. The total number of countries included in the GCI report for those years.

Without the specific years or access to the latest GCI reports, it is challenging to verify the exact improvement in Georgia's ranking. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent data and the number of countries (138) is accurate, we can cross-reference this with available GCI reports.

If the claim is found to be consistent with the data from the World Economic Forum's GCI reports, then it would be considered accurate. If there are discrepancies or if the improvement is not exactly 7 positions, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I will provide a general assessment based on typical verification steps:

1. Check the GCI report for the specified years.
2. Compare Georgia's rankings.
3. Confirm the number of countries included in the report.

Assuming the claim is based on accurate and recent data, and there is no significant discrepancy, the claim would likely be:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"In terms of security, Georgia is one of the leading positions in different rankings",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In terms of security, Georgia is one of the leading positions in different rankings,"" we need to examine various security-related rankings and reports that evaluate Georgia's position.

1. **Global Peace Index (GPI)**: The GPI measures the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness. As of recent reports, Georgia is not typically ranked among the top countries in terms of peace and security.

2. **Crime Index**: Websites like Numbeo provide a crime index that ranks countries based on the level of crime. Georgia often ranks relatively low in crime, indicating a safer environment compared to many other countries.

3. **Travel Advisories**: Various countries issue travel advisories for their citizens. Georgia is generally considered safe for travelers, with low levels of violent crime reported.

4. **Corruption Perception Index (CPI)**: Transparency International's CPI measures perceived levels of public sector corruption. Georgia has made significant improvements over the years and ranks better than many other countries, which can be an indirect indicator of security and governance.

5. **World Bank Governance Indicators**: These include measures of political stability and absence of violence/terrorism. Georgia has shown improvements in these areas but is not typically at the very top of global rankings.

Based on these points, while Georgia has made significant strides in improving security and governance, it is not consistently ranked among the very top countries globally in terms of security. Therefore, the claim is somewhat exaggerated but not entirely without basis.

1. ""We have taken offices in all districts"" - This implies that offices have been established in every district. Verification would require checking if there are indeed offices in all districts.

2. ""We have lost budget funding"" - This suggests that there has been a reduction or complete loss of budget funding. Verification would involve checking financial records or official statements confirming the loss of budget funding.

3. ""Forbidden free TV"" - This implies that access to free television has been restricted or prohibited. Verification would involve checking regulations or policies regarding free TV access.

Without specific context or additional information to verify these claims, it is challenging to determine their accuracy. However, if we assume the statement is from a credible source and there is no evidence to the contrary, we might consider it as 'Half True' because it contains multiple claims that could be partially accurate.

1. **Budget of the Ministry of Infrastructure**: The claim states that the budget of the Ministry of Infrastructure in the first quarter is 107%. This implies that the budget allocation or spending has exceeded the planned amount by 7%. To verify this, we would need access to official budget reports or statements from the Ministry of Infrastructure.

2. **Turkey's Self-Sufficiency in Livestock and Meat Export**: The claim suggests that Turkey has been self-sufficient in livestock and meat production and has been exporting these products. However, it also mentions that due to certain policies, there might be a need for imports.

To verify these points, we would need:
- Official budget reports from the Ministry of Infrastructure.
- Historical data on Turkey's livestock and meat production and export statistics.
- Recent policy changes or statements from relevant Turkish authorities regarding livestock and meat imports.

Without access to these specific data points, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge and trends:

- It is plausible that a ministry's budget could exceed 100% due to various factors such as additional funding or overspending.
- Turkey has historically been a significant producer of livestock and meat, but there have been periods where imports were necessary due to various reasons such as domestic shortages or policy changes.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data verification, the claim appears to be a mix of accurate and potentially exaggerated information.

1. **Water Pricing**: We need to compare the actual water tariffs in Telavi and Tbilisi. This information can typically be obtained from local water utility companies or municipal records.

2. **Water Availability**: The claim suggests that Telavi residents receive water for only 2 hours per day, while Tbilisi residents have access to water 24 hours a day. This needs to be verified through local reports or news sources.

3. **Cost Comparison**: Even if the water tariffs are the same, the total cost paid by residents can differ based on the amount of water consumed and the duration of availability.

Without specific data on water tariffs and availability, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified information, it could be plausible.

Given the lack of specific data in the provided context, the most cautious and reasonable categorization would be:

"Adjara's 2012 budget was 131 million, now is 236 million, growth 57%",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the figures and the percentage growth calculation.

1. **Initial Budget in 2012**: 131 million
2. **Current Budget**: 236 million

To calculate the percentage growth:
\[ \text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{\text{Current Budget} - \text{Initial Budget}}{\text{Initial Budget}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{236 - 131}{131} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Growth} = \left( \frac{105}{131} \right) \times 100 \]

The claim states that the total annual cost is GEL 3.5 million and that GEL 2.5 million of this is for salaries.

Without access to specific financial records or official statements from the Crisis Management Council, it is challenging to verify these exact figures. However, if we assume that the provided figures are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If there is any discrepancy in the figures or if the provided information is not entirely accurate, the claim could fall into one of the other categories.

3. Whether there was a continuation of this process in 2015.

Without specific and verifiable information about the water issues in Telavi and the stages mentioned, it is challenging to fully validate the claim. However, based on the structure and the typical issues faced by regions, it is plausible that water could be a significant problem and that there were efforts to address it over several years.

The first time the election is increasing in foreign direct investment in the year,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The first time the election is increasing in foreign direct investment in the year,"" we need to break down the statement and analyze its components.

1. **""The first time""**: This implies that there has never been a previous instance where an election has led to an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) within a year.

2. **""The election is increasing in foreign direct investment""**: This suggests a direct causal relationship between the election and an increase in FDI.

3. **""In the year""**: This specifies the timeframe within which the increase in FDI is being observed.

To evaluate this claim, we would need historical data on FDI trends and their correlation with election years. Elections can influence FDI, but it is not necessarily the first time this has happened. Many factors, including political stability, economic policies, and investor confidence, can affect FDI, and these factors can be influenced by elections.

Given that elections have occurred many times in various countries and have often been associated with changes in FDI, it is highly unlikely that this is the first instance of such a correlation.

This claim suggests that the Ministry of Health has not used any cars for work or personal purposes since 2012.

Given the nature of government operations and the necessity for transportation in various official capacities, it seems highly unlikely that the Ministry of Health would completely cease the use of cars for work purposes. Additionally, there is no widely known policy or publicized decision that supports this claim.

2. **Simplified Border Procedures**: This involves assessing the efficiency and simplicity of border procedures compared to other regions. If the procedures are demonstrably simpler, this part of the claim would be true.

3. **Non-Corruption**: This is a strong claim implying the absence of corruption. Given that corruption can exist to varying degrees in most places, claiming ""non-corruption"" is quite absolute and would be difficult to substantiate fully.

2. **Non-Payment Consequence**: It is common for utility companies to cut off electricity due to non-payment.
3. **Number of Families**: The specific number, 20,214, needs to be verified through reliable sources such as news reports, official statements, or utility company records.

Without access to specific data or sources confirming the exact number of families affected, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, the structure of the claim is plausible based on common practices regarding utility non-payment.

Given the lack of specific evidence to confirm the exact number but acknowledging the plausibility of the situation:

"According to Geostat's data, production turnover in the business sector is reduced by 22%",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""According to Geostat's data, production turnover in the business sector is reduced by 22%,"" I would need to verify the specific data from Geostat, which is the National Statistics Office of Georgia. This would involve checking the latest reports or publications from Geostat regarding the business sector's production turnover.

Since I do not have access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet, I cannot verify the claim directly. However, if you have access to the latest Geostat reports and they confirm a 22% reduction in production turnover, then the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows a different figure, the claim would be adjusted accordingly.

Given the lack of specific data verification in this context, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. Therefore, I would recommend checking the latest Geostat reports for the most accurate information.

Gigi Ugulava, a Georgian politician, has faced multiple legal issues over the years. However, without specific dates or additional context, it is challenging to confirm the exact duration of his pre-trial detention in any particular case.

Given the lack of precise information in the claim and the need for verification from reliable sources, it is difficult to definitively categorize the statement.

"As for the National Movement in Adjara for nine years, education infrastructure facilities, I ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details about the National Movement's activities in Adjara over a nine-year period, particularly focusing on education infrastructure facilities. This would involve checking historical records, government reports, and other reliable sources to confirm whether the National Movement indeed worked on education infrastructure in Adjara for nine years.

Without access to specific data or sources to verify this claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some known historical context, we might be able to make an educated guess.

Given the lack of specific information provided in the claim and the need for verification, the most cautious approach would be to categorize it as 'Half True' because it suggests some level of activity but lacks detailed evidence.

"Bobokvati's residence, which the government handed over to the Patriarchate in exchange for the property in Krtsanisi, ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details regarding the exchange of properties between the government and the Patriarchate. This involves confirming whether the government indeed handed over a residence in Bobokvati to the Patriarchate in exchange for property in Krtsanisi.

Without access to specific and verifiable information or sources confirming this exchange, it is not possible to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified information, we can proceed with the evaluation.

Given the structure of the claim, it appears to be a straightforward statement of fact. If the exchange did occur as described, the claim would be 'True'. If there were some inaccuracies or missing context, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the exchange did not occur or was significantly different from what is described, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Since I do not have access to the specific details or sources to verify this claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure and assuming the claim is based on accurate information, I would lean towards:

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
We are the only country in the region that has free trade with both Europe and China,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are the only country in the region that has free trade with both Europe and China,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of ""the region""**: The claim does not specify which region it refers to. This could be a continent, a subcontinent, or a specific geopolitical area.
2. **Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)**: We need to verify if the country in question has FTAs with both Europe (likely referring to the European Union) and China.
3. **Comparison with other countries in the region**: We need to check if other countries in the same region also have FTAs with both Europe and China.

Let's assume the region in question is Asia, as it is a common context for such claims.

- **China's FTAs**: China has several FTAs, including with ASEAN countries, Australia, and others.
- **European Union's FTAs**: The EU has FTAs with several countries, including South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.

For example, South Korea has FTAs with both the European Union and China. Similarly, Japan has an Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU and a trade agreement with China through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

Given this information, the claim that a country is the ""only"" one in the region with FTAs with both Europe and China is likely inaccurate.

All citizens of Georgia were 60%poor,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""All citizens of Georgia were 60% poor,"" we need to analyze the statement carefully.

1. **""All citizens of Georgia""**: This implies that every single person in Georgia is included in the claim.
2. **""were 60% poor""**: This suggests that 60% of each individual citizen's status is poor, which is a confusing and nonsensical way to describe poverty. Typically, poverty statistics are expressed as a percentage of the population that falls below the poverty line, not as a percentage of each individual's status.

Given the phrasing, the claim is inherently flawed and does not make logical sense. Poverty statistics are usually presented as a percentage of the population, not as a percentage of each individual. Therefore, the claim is not accurate in its current form.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"“Today, when each pensioner receives 150 GEL, he loses about 12 GEL per month, that is, a year d ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the context and the basis of the statement. The claim suggests that each pensioner receiving 150 GEL loses about 12 GEL per month. This could imply a loss due to inflation, currency devaluation, or some other economic factor.

1. **Inflation**: If the claim is based on inflation, we need to know the inflation rate in the region. For example, if the inflation rate is 8% annually, the monthly loss in purchasing power can be calculated.

2. **Currency Devaluation**: If the claim is based on currency devaluation, we need to know the rate at which the currency is losing value.

3. **Other Economic Factors**: There could be other factors such as increased cost of living, changes in pension policies, etc.

Without specific data on the inflation rate, currency devaluation, or other economic factors affecting the pensioners, it is challenging to verify the exact monthly loss of 12 GEL.

However, if we assume the claim is based on a reasonable inflation rate or economic factor that is not explicitly stated but is plausible, we might consider it as 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If there is no basis or the numbers do not add up, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact monthly loss, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

"“Since November 2013, economic growth has been steadily high, within 7-8 percent ... 2014 ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Since November 2013, economic growth has been steadily high, within 7-8 percent ... 2014 ..."", we need to look at the actual economic growth data for the relevant period.

1. **Global Context**: Economic growth rates can vary significantly by country. The claim does not specify which country or region it refers to, which makes it challenging to verify without additional context.

2. **Historical Data**: For many major economies, such as the United States, European Union, or Japan, growth rates of 7-8 percent are unusually high. These economies typically experience growth rates in the range of 2-3 percent. However, for rapidly growing economies like China or India, growth rates in the range of 7-8 percent have been more common during certain periods.

3. **Specific Data Check**:
   - **China**: China's GDP growth rate was around 7.7% in 2013, 7.3% in 2014, and continued to be in the 6-7% range in subsequent years.
   - **India**: India's GDP growth rate was around 6.4% in 2013, 7.4% in 2014, and continued to be in the 7-8% range in subsequent years.

Given the lack of specific context in the claim, but considering that some major economies like China and India did experience growth rates within the 7-8 percent range during the specified period, the claim can be considered accurate for those economies.

This would involve checking the source of the claim, the identity of the speaker, the enterprises in question, and any available evidence or records that support or refute the statement.

Without access to this specific information, I cannot definitively assess the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to evaluating such claims:

1. **Source Verification**: Identify who made the claim and their credibility.
2. **Evidence**: Look for supporting data or records that confirm the number of enterprises and their status over the years.
3. **Context**: Understand the context in which the enterprises were brought for sale and why they were previously ignored.

Given the lack of specific information in the provided text, I cannot make a definitive judgment. Therefore, I would refrain from categorizing the claim without further evidence.

1. Whether Genggem (or a similar authority) stated that something cannot be built on Zhvania Street.
2. Whether Kaladze signed something related to this matter, and if so, what the nature of that signature was.

Without additional context or verification from reliable sources, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, based on the structure of the statement, it suggests a contradiction between Genggem's assertion and Kaladze's actions.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy. Therefore, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

"“For many years, Parliament has recognized and recognized many constitutional lawsuits for the first time ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the statement in detail. The statement suggests that Parliament has both recognized and recognized many constitutional lawsuits for the first time over many years. 

1. **Parliament's Role**: Parliament is a legislative body, and its primary function is to make and pass laws. It does not typically ""recognize"" lawsuits; that is generally the role of the judiciary. 

2. **Constitutional Lawsuits**: These are typically recognized and adjudicated by courts, not by Parliament. Courts interpret the constitutionality of laws and actions through judicial review.

3. **Historical Context**: There may be instances where Parliament has acknowledged the importance of certain constitutional issues or has responded to court rulings by amending laws, but this is different from recognizing lawsuits.

Given these points, the claim that Parliament has ""recognized and recognized many constitutional lawsuits for the first time"" is misleading because it conflates the roles of the legislative and judicial branches.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"""The salary of teachers will increase by 17 percent""",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The salary of teachers will increase by 17 percent,"" we need to consider the context and the source of the information. Here are some factors to consider:

1. **Official Announcements**: Has there been an official announcement from a credible source, such as a government body, educational institution, or teachers' union, confirming a 17 percent salary increase for teachers?

2. **Implementation Timeline**: Is the 17 percent increase scheduled to happen immediately, over a period of time, or is it a proposed figure that has not yet been approved?

3. **Geographical Scope**: Is the claim specific to a particular region, state, or country? Salary changes can vary widely depending on the location.

4. **Conditions and Exceptions**: Are there any conditions or exceptions to the salary increase? For example, is it only applicable to certain levels of teachers or under specific circumstances?

Without specific details or verification from a credible source, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that there has been a recent credible announcement confirming this increase, we could consider the claim to be accurate.

Given the lack of specific context in the question, I will base my response on the assumption that the claim is derived from a credible and recent announcement.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
"In Georgia, extreme poverty has increased in all categories of population",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In Georgia, extreme poverty has increased in all categories of population,"" we need to examine recent data and reports on poverty in Georgia. This includes looking at statistics from reputable sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, and other relevant studies or reports.

1. **Definition of Extreme Poverty**: Extreme poverty is typically defined as living on less than $2 per day per person, but in the context of the United States, it often refers to living below 50% of the federal poverty line.

2. **Recent Data**: According to the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources, poverty rates can fluctuate based on economic conditions, policy changes, and other factors. It's important to look at data over a period of time to identify trends.

3. **Categories of Population**: This includes different demographics such as age groups (children, adults, elderly), racial and ethnic groups, urban vs. rural populations, and other socioeconomic categories.

To verify the claim, we would need to see if there is consistent evidence showing an increase in extreme poverty across all these categories in Georgia.

- **Children**: Reports from organizations like the Annie E. Casey Foundation often provide data on child poverty.
- **Adults**: Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other economic reports can provide insights into adult poverty rates.
- **Elderly**: Organizations like the AARP and government reports can provide data on poverty among the elderly.
- **Racial and Ethnic Groups**: The U.S. Census Bureau and other studies often break down poverty rates by race and ethnicity.
- **Urban vs. Rural**: Reports from the Georgia Department of Community Affairs and other sources can provide insights into urban and rural poverty rates.

If the data shows that extreme poverty has increased in all these categories, the claim would be true. If it shows increases in some but not all categories, the claim would be less accurate.

Based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there is no comprehensive evidence to support the claim that extreme poverty has increased in all categories of the population in Georgia. While some categories may have seen increases, others may not have, or may have even seen decreases.

The loss of profit tax has been reduced by government administrative costs and excise tax ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The loss of profit tax has been reduced by government administrative costs and excise tax,"" we need to analyze the relationship between profit tax, government administrative costs, and excise tax.

1. **Profit Tax**: This is a tax levied on the profits earned by businesses.
2. **Government Administrative Costs**: These are the expenses incurred by the government to administer and enforce tax laws.
3. **Excise Tax**: This is a tax levied on specific goods, such as alcohol, tobacco, and fuel.

The claim suggests that the loss of profit tax (presumably a reduction in revenue from profit tax) has been reduced by government administrative costs and excise tax. This implies that the reduction in profit tax revenue is somehow offset or mitigated by these two factors.

- **Government Administrative Costs**: These are typically expenses and do not directly generate revenue. Therefore, they would not reduce the loss of profit tax revenue. In fact, higher administrative costs could potentially increase the loss if they are not efficiently managed.
  
- **Excise Tax**: This is a source of revenue for the government. If the government increases excise taxes, it could potentially offset some of the revenue loss from profit tax. However, this would depend on the extent of the increase in excise tax and its ability to compensate for the loss in profit tax revenue.

Given this analysis, the claim that the loss of profit tax has been reduced by government administrative costs is incorrect because administrative costs are expenses, not revenue. The part about excise tax could be partially true if the increase in excise tax revenue offsets the loss in profit tax revenue, but this is not clearly established in the claim.

This would typically involve checking reliable sources such as official reports, news articles, or statements from the involved parties.

However, based on the information provided in the claim alone, it is not possible to definitively verify the percentage of completion or the involvement of the Ukrainian company without additional context or data.

"In 2012, 11 million were spent on City Hall and Ips in Kutaisi, and today 19 million are spent on",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details regarding the expenditures on City Hall and Ips in Kutaisi for the years mentioned. This involves checking reliable sources or official records that document the spending in 2012 and the current spending.

1. **2012 Expenditure**: Verify if 11 million was indeed spent on City Hall and Ips in Kutaisi in 2012.
2. **Current Expenditure**: Verify if the current spending is 19 million.

Without access to specific financial records or credible sources that confirm these figures, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the figures are accurate based on the information provided:

- If both figures are correct, the claim would be 'True'.
- If one figure is correct but the other is not, the claim would be 'Half True'.
- If both figures are incorrect, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to verify these numbers, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming the figures are accurate:

"In Georgia, 11,400 people die each year with tobacco diseases ... tobacco ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Georgia, 11,400 people die each year with tobacco diseases,"" we need to consult reliable sources such as health department statistics, CDC data, or other reputable health organizations.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The CDC provides state-specific data on tobacco-related deaths. For Georgia, the CDC's data and reports from the Georgia Department of Public Health can be used to verify this claim.

As of the latest available data, the CDC reports that smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths annually in the United States, including deaths from secondhand smoke. State-specific data often show that thousands of deaths in each state are attributable to smoking-related illnesses.

Based on the CDC's data and other health reports, the claim that approximately 11,400 people die each year in Georgia due to tobacco-related diseases appears to be consistent with the reported figures for tobacco-related mortality in the state.

Georgia's rating has deteriorated at Doing Business due to the new research methodology,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgia's rating has deteriorated at Doing Business due to the new research methodology,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the Doing Business Report**: The Doing Business report by the World Bank assesses the ease of doing business in various countries based on several indicators. Changes in methodology can impact rankings.

2. **Changes in Methodology**: The World Bank has periodically updated its methodology for the Doing Business report. These changes can affect the rankings of countries, sometimes causing shifts that are not necessarily reflective of actual changes in the business environment but rather due to the new criteria or adjustments in the scoring system.

3. **Georgia's Performance**: Historically, Georgia has performed well in the Doing Business rankings. If there has been a recent change in methodology, it is plausible that this could impact Georgia's ranking.

4. **Verification**: To confirm the claim, one would need to look at the specific reports and any statements from the World Bank regarding the impact of methodological changes on Georgia's ranking.

Given the information and the context provided, it is reasonable to infer that changes in methodology could indeed affect a country's ranking. However, without specific data confirming that Georgia's rating has deteriorated specifically due to the new research methodology, we cannot definitively state the claim as entirely true.

Without access to the exact figures and official records, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim.

However, based on the structure of the statement, it appears to be a specific claim about the salary amount and the timing. If we assume the context is accurate and the figures are correct, the claim could be considered accurate. But without concrete evidence, we cannot be certain.

Given the lack of specific verification, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

1. **Research IMF Reports and Statements**: Look for any official IMF reports, press releases, or statements that specifically mention Georgia's tax reforms and describe them as successful.

2. **Context of Reforms**: Understand the context and specifics of the tax reforms in Georgia. This includes what changes were made, when they were implemented, and the outcomes observed.

3. **Third-Party Verification**: Check if other reputable sources or organizations have corroborated the IMF's assessment of Georgia's tax reforms.

Without access to specific IMF documents or statements, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on actual IMF reports or statements, it could be considered accurate.

1. The number of employees in the public sector in 2012.
2. Whether ""the Dream"" came to power in 2012.

First, let's address the number of employees in the public sector in 2012. According to various sources, the number of public sector employees can vary significantly by country and context. Without specific data for a particular country, it's challenging to confirm the exact number of public sector employees in 2012.

Second, ""the Dream"" is not a widely recognized political entity or party. If ""the Dream"" refers to a specific political party or coalition, we would need more context to verify if they came to power in 2012.

"GEL 2 billion in water, the growth rate of agriculture is reduced",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""GEL 2 billion in water, the growth rate of agriculture is reduced,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. The investment of GEL 2 billion in water.
2. The impact of this investment on the growth rate of agriculture.

First, let's consider the investment of GEL 2 billion in water. GEL is the currency of Georgia, and an investment of this magnitude would be significant. However, without specific context or data, it's difficult to verify whether such an investment has been made.

Second, the claim suggests that this investment leads to a reduction in the growth rate of agriculture. Typically, investments in water infrastructure (such as irrigation systems) are intended to improve agricultural productivity, not reduce it. Therefore, the assertion that such an investment would reduce the growth rate of agriculture seems counterintuitive and would require substantial evidence to support.

Given the lack of specific data and the counterintuitive nature of the claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. Therefore, based on the information available, the claim appears to be misleading.

1. ""This year we gave the Ministry of Infrastructure 20% more budget.""
2. ""According to 6 months, more than 100%...""

For the first part, we need to verify if the Ministry of Infrastructure indeed received a 20% increase in its budget compared to the previous year. This would require access to budgetary records or official statements confirming the budget allocation.

For the second part, the statement ""according to 6 months, more than 100%..."" is incomplete and unclear. It seems to imply that within 6 months, some metric (possibly spending or project completion) exceeded 100%, but without additional context or clarification, it's difficult to assess the accuracy of this part of the claim.

Given the incomplete nature of the second part and the need for verification of the first part, the claim cannot be fully validated or invalidated based on the provided information.

"50,000 inhabitants from the highlands of Adjara ... Mountain can no longer bear, Khulo population 35-36a ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The population of the highlands of Adjara.
2. The specific population of Khulo.
3. The context of ""Mountain can no longer bear.""

1. **Population of the highlands of Adjara**: Adjara is an autonomous republic in Georgia, and its highland areas are less densely populated compared to the coastal regions. The total population of Adjara is around 350,000, but the highland areas have significantly fewer inhabitants.

2. **Population of Khulo**: Khulo is a municipality in the highlands of Adjara. According to recent data, the population of Khulo is approximately 23,000-25,000, not 35,000-36,000 as stated in the claim.

3. **Context of ""Mountain can no longer bear""**: This phrase is vague and could refer to environmental degradation, overpopulation, or other issues. Without specific context, it's challenging to verify this part of the claim.

Given the discrepancies in the population figures and the lack of context for the environmental claim, the statement appears to be inaccurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The depreciation of the GEL is due to the fact that the import is very increased,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The depreciation of the GEL is due to the fact that the import is very increased,"" we need to consider the relationship between currency depreciation and import levels.

Currency depreciation can be influenced by various factors, including but not limited to:
1. Trade balance: A country that imports significantly more than it exports may see its currency depreciate because it needs to exchange more of its currency for foreign currencies to pay for imports.
2. Inflation: Higher import levels can lead to higher inflation if the imported goods are essential and their prices rise.
3. Foreign exchange reserves: Increased imports can deplete a country's foreign exchange reserves, putting downward pressure on the currency.
4. Investor confidence: High import levels can affect investor confidence, leading to capital outflows and currency depreciation.

However, currency depreciation is a complex phenomenon and can also be influenced by other factors such as:
- Monetary policy and interest rates
- Political stability
- Global economic conditions
- Speculative activities in the forex market

Given that increased imports can contribute to currency depreciation but are not the sole factor, the claim has some basis in truth but oversimplifies the situation.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Railway freight is increased,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Railway freight is increased,"" we need to consider the context and the specific time frame. Railway freight can fluctuate based on various factors such as economic conditions, policy changes, and seasonal variations. Without specific data or a defined period, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim.

However, if we assume the claim is referring to a general trend or a recent period, we can look at available data and reports from relevant authorities like railway companies or government transportation departments. If recent reports indicate an increase in railway freight, the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if reports show a decrease or no significant change, the claim would be false or mostly false.

Given the lack of specific context or data in the claim provided, we can only make a general assessment.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
“The Prime Minister of Georgia has said clearly that it is acceptable to him the way to Serbia Kos ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify whether the Prime Minister of Georgia has indeed made a statement regarding the acceptability of the way to Serbia Kos. This involves checking reliable sources for any such statement made by the Prime Minister of Georgia.

Given the information provided, there is no context or evidence to support the claim. Without additional verification from credible sources, it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of the statement.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Georgia is the only country in the region whose economy will grow,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Georgia is the only country in the region whose economy will grow,"" we need to consider the economic forecasts for the region in question. The region likely refers to the South Caucasus, which includes Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, or it could refer to a broader region such as Eastern Europe or the former Soviet states.

1. **Economic Forecasts**: We need to look at the latest economic forecasts from reputable sources such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, or regional economic reports.
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the projected economic growth rates of Georgia with those of neighboring countries in the same region.

### Example Analysis (Hypothetical Data for Illustration):
- **IMF Forecasts**:
  - Georgia: Projected growth of 5%
  - Armenia: Projected growth of 3%
  - Azerbaijan: Projected growth of 2%

If the data shows that other countries in the region also have positive economic growth projections, the claim would not be accurate.

### Conclusion:
Based on the hypothetical data provided, the claim that ""Georgia is the only country in the region whose economy will grow"" would be incorrect because other countries in the region also have positive growth projections.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"Tbilisi City Hall does not spend money, it is 140 million, it is transferred to the remains",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Tbilisi City Hall does not spend money, it is 140 million, it is transferred to the remains,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Source**: The claim needs to be verified against official financial reports or statements from Tbilisi City Hall. Without specific context or source, it's challenging to assess the accuracy.

2. **Budget and Expenditure**: City budgets often have allocated funds that may not be fully spent within a fiscal year. Unspent funds can be carried over to the next fiscal year or reallocated.

3. **Specific Figures**: The claim mentions a specific amount, 140 million. Verification would require checking Tbilisi City Hall's financial records to see if this figure matches any unspent funds or budgetary remains.

4. **Terminology**: The term ""transferred to the remains"" is unclear. It could mean the funds are carried over to the next fiscal year, reallocated, or simply unspent.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context provided in the claim, it is difficult to definitively verify its accuracy. However, based on general practices in municipal budgeting, it is plausible that unspent funds could be carried over or reallocated.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Creating new fractions of the Georgian Dream in Parliament will not result in additional costs,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Creating new fractions of the Georgian Dream in Parliament will not result in additional costs,"" we need to consider the potential financial implications of forming new parliamentary fractions.

1. **Administrative Costs**: Forming new fractions may require additional administrative support, such as staff, office space, and resources, which could incur costs.
2. **Operational Costs**: New fractions might need separate budgets for their operations, including meetings, travel, and other parliamentary activities.
3. **Budget Allocation**: If the existing budget is reallocated without increasing the overall expenditure, it might not result in additional costs. However, if new funds are required, it would lead to additional expenses.

Given these considerations, the claim that creating new fractions will not result in additional costs is likely to be an oversimplification. While it is possible to manage within the existing budget, there are usually some additional costs associated with administrative and operational needs.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
“GDP decline [decrease in real growth rate] began in the summer of 2012.He has repeatedly said this ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""GDP decline [decrease in real growth rate] began in the summer of 2012,"" we need to look at historical GDP data for that period.

According to data from sources like the World Bank and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. GDP growth rate did experience fluctuations around 2012. However, the specific claim that a decline began in the summer of 2012 would need to be verified by looking at quarterly GDP growth rates for that year.

In 2012, the U.S. GDP growth rates by quarter were as follows:
- Q1 2012: 3.2%
- Q2 2012: 1.5%
- Q3 2012: 2.5%
- Q4 2012: 0.1%

From this data, we can see that there was a significant drop from Q1 to Q2, which could be interpreted as a decline beginning in the summer. However, the growth rate did pick up again in Q3 before dropping sharply in Q4.

Given this information, the claim that the GDP decline began in the summer of 2012 is somewhat accurate but not entirely precise, as the growth rate did increase in Q3 before declining again in Q4.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Before coming to power in power, 49% of Georgia's population lived beyond poverty, now ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific statistics regarding poverty in Georgia before and after the current administration came to power. This involves checking reliable sources such as government reports, reputable news outlets, and international organizations that track poverty rates.

1. **Historical Poverty Rate**: We need to confirm if 49% of Georgia's population was indeed living in poverty before the current administration took office.
2. **Current Poverty Rate**: We need to check the most recent data to see what the current poverty rate is under the current administration.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to find this information:

- Look for reports from the World Bank, United Nations, or Georgia's National Statistics Office.
- Check for news articles or research papers that discuss changes in poverty rates in Georgia over the relevant time period.

If the data confirms that 49% of the population was living in poverty before the current administration and shows a significant change now, the claim could be rated accordingly.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and the need for verification:

Final Answer: **Half True**",half true,False,False
Life level is increased by 40-50%,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Life level is increased by 40-50%,"" we need to understand the context and the specific parameters being measured. The term ""life level"" is vague and could refer to various aspects such as lifespan, quality of life, health metrics, or other factors. Without a clear definition and supporting evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim accurately.

Given the lack of context and specific information, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The European Charter on the status of judges is counted as a probation period before the life of judges ...,true,ka,"The claim that ""The European Charter on the status of judges is counted as a probation period before the life of judges"" is not accurate. The European Charter on the Statute for Judges, adopted by the Council of Europe in 1998, sets out principles and guidelines to ensure the independence, competence, and impartiality of judges. It does not specifically establish or count a probation period before judges are appointed for life. Instead, it provides a framework for the selection, training, and career development of judges, emphasizing the importance of judicial independence and security of tenure.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
It is a gross interference in parliamentary activity when the president dictates [veto format] what is going on in the law ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the role of the president in the legislative process and the concept of separation of powers.

1. **Role of the President in Legislation**: In many democratic systems, the president has the power to veto legislation passed by the parliament. This is a constitutional mechanism designed to provide a check and balance on legislative power. The veto can often be overridden by a supermajority in the parliament, depending on the specific country's laws.

2. **Separation of Powers**: The principle of separation of powers ensures that the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government operate independently. The president's veto power is a recognized part of this system and is not typically considered an interference but rather a constitutional check.

3. **Interference in Parliamentary Activity**: The claim suggests that the president's use of veto power is a ""gross interference"" in parliamentary activity. However, since the veto is a constitutionally granted power, its use is a legitimate part of the legislative process rather than an interference.

Given these points, the claim that the president's use of veto power constitutes a ""gross interference in parliamentary activity"" is not accurate. The veto is a standard and accepted part of the legislative process in many democratic systems.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"Whatever steps in the case of Mukhtarli case, these steps were taken ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Whatever steps in the case of Mukhtarli case, these steps were taken ..."", we need to evaluate the context and the specific actions referred to in the Mukhtarli case. 

The Mukhtarli case involves Azerbaijani journalist Afgan Mukhtarli, who was reportedly abducted in Tbilisi, Georgia, in May 2017 and later surfaced in Azerbaijani custody. The case has been surrounded by allegations of human rights violations and questions about the involvement of Georgian and Azerbaijani authorities.

Without specific details on what ""steps"" are being referred to, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, if the claim is suggesting that all necessary and appropriate steps were taken by the authorities involved, this is a matter of significant debate and controversy. Various human rights organizations and international observers have criticized the handling of the case, suggesting that not all appropriate steps were taken to ensure Mukhtarli's safety and legal rights.

Given the lack of clarity and the contested nature of the actions taken in the Mukhtarli case, the claim cannot be fully verified as true.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"“We have signed a contract with the World Bank, according to which we received preferential credit and ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the following:

1. Whether a contract has indeed been signed with the World Bank.
2. Whether the contract includes the provision of preferential credit.

Without specific evidence or documentation to confirm these details, it is not possible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is made by a credible source and there is no reason to doubt its authenticity, we might lean towards it being accurate.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"The village will no longer live at all, 57 GEL is a family output",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The village will no longer live at all, 57 GEL is a family output,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The village will no longer live at all"" - This is a very strong and absolute statement. It implies that the entire village will cease to exist or function, which is difficult to verify without specific context or evidence. Such a claim would require substantial proof, such as evidence of a catastrophic event or policy that would lead to the complete abandonment or destruction of the village.

2. ""57 GEL is a family output"" - This part of the claim is more specific and measurable. GEL is the currency of Georgia (Georgian Lari). To assess this, we would need to know if 57 GEL is indeed the average or typical output (income or production) for a family in the village. This would require statistical data or economic reports from the region.

Without additional context or evidence to support these statements, it is challenging to verify their accuracy. However, given the absolute nature of the first part and the lack of context for the second part, the claim appears to be exaggerated or lacking sufficient evidence.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
"“About 70,000 citizens have lost social assistance because the ministry has started strongly ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""About 70,000 citizens have lost social assistance because the ministry has started strongly ..."", we would need to verify several key points:

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there are credible sources or official statements from the ministry or relevant authorities confirming that approximately 70,000 citizens have indeed lost social assistance.
2. **Context and Reason**: Understand the context and the specific reasons why these citizens lost social assistance. The claim suggests it is due to the ministry's strong actions, but it is important to know what those actions were (e.g., policy changes, stricter eligibility criteria, fraud prevention measures).
3. **Time Frame**: Determine the time frame during which these changes occurred to ensure the claim is current and relevant.

Without access to specific data or official reports, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on a credible source and there is no contradictory evidence, we might lean towards a certain level of accuracy.

Given the lack of specific details and verification in this context, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
“Absolutely every faction representative of this resolution [Razol of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify whether ""absolutely every faction representative"" of the resolution by Razol of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly supported it. This would require checking the voting records or statements from all faction representatives involved in the resolution.

Without specific evidence or data to confirm that every single faction representative supported the resolution, it is not possible to definitively state that the claim is entirely true. Given the absolute nature of the claim (""absolutely every""), even a single dissenting representative would make the claim inaccurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
525 million GEL is spent on bureaucracy [government],mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""525 million GEL is spent on bureaucracy [government],"" we need to verify the actual expenditure figures from reliable sources such as government budget reports or financial statements.

1. **Check Government Budget Reports**: Look for the most recent budget report from the Georgian government. This report should detail the expenditures on various sectors, including bureaucracy or administrative costs.

2. **Cross-Reference with Other Sources**: Verify the information with other credible sources such as financial news, reports from international financial institutions, or independent audits.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: Understand what is included in ""bureaucracy"" spending. This could encompass salaries of government employees, administrative costs, operational expenses, etc.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if you have access to the latest budget report or a reliable source that confirms the expenditure, you can compare it to the 525 million GEL figure.

Given the need for precise data to make an accurate determination, I would recommend checking the latest available budget report from the Georgian government or a reliable financial news source.

Final Answer: **Unable to determine without specific data**",,False,True
Kutaisi Tourism Information Center in Georgia will be the largest,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the Kutaisi Tourism Information Center in Georgia will be the largest, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Information**: As of the latest available data, there is no widely recognized or official statement confirming that the Kutaisi Tourism Information Center will be the largest in Georgia or in any other specific context (e.g., largest in terms of size, visitor capacity, or services offered).

2. **Comparative Analysis**: There are other significant tourism information centers in Georgia, such as those in Tbilisi and Batumi, which are major tourist hubs. Without specific metrics or official announcements, it is difficult to verify the claim.

3. **Official Announcements**: If there were an official announcement from a credible source (e.g., Georgian National Tourism Administration) stating that the Kutaisi Tourism Information Center will be the largest, it would lend credibility to the claim. However, such an announcement is not currently available in the public domain.

Given the lack of concrete evidence or official confirmation, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Removal of a significant portion of the Public Broadcaster's procurement from the legislation of the EU ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Removal of a significant portion of the Public Broadcaster's procurement from the legislation of the EU,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of EU legislation regarding public procurement and broadcasting.

1. **EU Legislation on Public Procurement**: The EU has comprehensive rules governing public procurement to ensure transparency, competition, and value for money. These rules apply to public broadcasters as they are often publicly funded entities.

2. **Exemptions and Specific Provisions**: There are certain exemptions and specific provisions within EU procurement rules that can apply to public broadcasters, particularly concerning content production and acquisition, which may not be subject to the same procurement rules as other goods and services.

3. **Recent Changes or Proposals**: If there have been recent legislative changes or proposals specifically targeting the procurement processes of public broadcasters, this could impact the claim's accuracy. However, without specific details on such changes, it's challenging to confirm the extent of the impact.

Given the general framework and the possibility of specific exemptions, the claim could be partially accurate but lacks detailed context to be fully verified.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"According to the World Bank, Georgia ranks 19th out of 190 countries in the fight against corruption....",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""According to the World Bank, Georgia ranks 19th out of 190 countries in the fight against corruption,"" we need to verify the specific ranking and source.

The World Bank does not typically publish a direct ranking of countries based on their fight against corruption. Instead, it provides various indicators and reports, such as the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), which include a measure for control of corruption. However, these indicators do not provide a straightforward ranking of countries.

Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is a more commonly referenced source for corruption rankings. According to the 2022 CPI, Georgia was ranked 41st out of 180 countries.

Given this information, the claim that Georgia ranks 19th out of 190 countries in the fight against corruption according to the World Bank is not accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
A recreational zone will be built in the area of ​​the zoo ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A recreational zone will be built in the area of the zoo,"" I would need specific information or evidence about the plans for the zoo area. This could include official announcements, planning documents, or credible news reports confirming the construction of a recreational zone in that location.

Since I do not have access to real-time data or specific details about the zoo in question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"30,000 children could not go to school.The number of these children has been reduced to 6,000 in the last two years",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The initial number of children who could not go to school was 30,000.
2. The current number of children who cannot go to school has been reduced to 6,000.
3. This reduction occurred over the last two years.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these numbers, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the numbers provided are accurate, the claim would be considered true. 

Given the information provided and assuming the numbers are correct:

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"The American teacher's program was closed by Ivanishvili.Almost 3,000 Americans were coming to Georgia ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The American teacher's program was closed by Ivanishvili. Almost 3,000 Americans were coming to Georgia,"" we need to examine the context and details surrounding the statement.

1. **American Teacher's Program**: This likely refers to the Teach and Learn with Georgia (TLG) program, which was an initiative to bring native English-speaking teachers to Georgia to improve English language education.

2. **Closed by Ivanishvili**: Bidzina Ivanishvili is a Georgian politician who served as the Prime Minister of Georgia from October 2012 to November 2013. If the program was indeed closed during or shortly after his tenure, this part of the claim could be accurate.

3. **Almost 3,000 Americans**: This part of the claim suggests a significant number of American participants. Verification would require checking the actual number of American teachers involved in the program.

Upon reviewing available information:
- The TLG program did see a reduction in funding and support after Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream coalition came to power.
- The program was not entirely closed but scaled down significantly.
- The number of American participants in the program varied, but it is unlikely that almost 3,000 Americans were involved at any single point in time.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also exaggerations and inaccuracies.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"You have increased administrative costs by 685 million GEL, which you have come to power.During the previous government the number of states was 101 thousand and in 2018 there were 116 thousand",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The increase in administrative costs by 685 million GEL since the current government came to power.
2. The change in the number of state employees from 101,000 during the previous government to 116,000 in 2018.

### Verification:

1. **Increase in Administrative Costs:**
   - If the administrative costs have indeed increased by 685 million GEL since the current government came to power, this part of the claim would be accurate. This would require access to budgetary records and financial reports from the relevant government departments.

2. **Number of State Employees:**
   - The claim states that the number of state employees was 101,000 during the previous government and increased to 116,000 in 2018. This can be verified through official employment records or reports from the relevant government agencies.

### Analysis:

- If both points are verified to be accurate, the claim would be 'True'.
- If one point is accurate and the other is not, the claim would be 'Half True'.
- If both points are somewhat accurate but not entirely, the claim would be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the degree of accuracy.
- If both points are inaccurate, the claim would be 'False'.

### Conclusion:

Without access to the specific data required to verify these points, we can only hypothesize based on the structure of the claim. However, assuming the data provided in the claim is accurate and verifiable:

**Final Answer: Mostly True**",mostly true,False,False
"Cartu Bank does not issue mortgages, but as exceptions he issues mortgages ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break it down:

1. ""Cartu Bank does not issue mortgages"" suggests that as a general policy, Cartu Bank does not provide mortgage loans.
2. ""but as exceptions he issues mortgages"" implies that there are certain circumstances under which Cartu Bank does indeed issue mortgages, despite the general policy.

Given these points, the claim acknowledges that while the general rule is that Cartu Bank does not issue mortgages, there are exceptions to this rule where mortgages are issued.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely false, but it is not entirely true either. It falls somewhere in between, acknowledging both the general policy and the exceptions.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
In Ukraine the Orthodox Church,false,ka,"The claim ""In Ukraine the Orthodox Church"" is incomplete and lacks context. To evaluate its truthfulness, more specific information is needed about what is being claimed regarding the Orthodox Church in Ukraine. For example, if the claim were ""In Ukraine, the Orthodox Church is the predominant religious institution,"" it could be evaluated based on available data about religious demographics in Ukraine.

Given the incomplete nature of the claim, it is not possible to accurately assess its truthfulness.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"In Ukraine is strengthened, ruble is solid in Russia and the lari rate in Georgia is still falling",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the current economic conditions and currency exchange rates in Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia.

1. **Ukraine**: The economic situation in Ukraine has been significantly impacted by the ongoing conflict with Russia. The Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH) has faced considerable volatility. While there may be periods of relative stability or strengthening, the overall economic environment remains challenging.

2. **Russia**: The Russian ruble (RUB) has experienced fluctuations due to international sanctions and economic pressures. While there have been efforts to stabilize the ruble, it is subject to significant external and internal economic factors.

3. **Georgia**: The Georgian lari (GEL) has faced depreciation pressures due to various economic factors, including regional instability and economic policies. The lari has shown a tendency to weaken over time.

Given these points:

- The claim that the currency in Ukraine is ""strengthened"" is not entirely accurate given the ongoing conflict and economic instability.
- The claim that the ruble is ""solid"" in Russia is an oversimplification, as the ruble's stability is subject to significant economic pressures.
- The claim that the lari rate in Georgia is ""still falling"" aligns with recent trends of depreciation.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
The salary in the regulatory commissions is 14-16 thousand GEL and its upper limit has not been established,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The salary in the regulatory commissions is 14-16 thousand GEL and its upper limit has not been established,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Salary Range**: Verify if the typical salary range for positions within regulatory commissions in the relevant jurisdiction (presumably Georgia, given the currency) falls between 14,000 and 16,000 GEL.
2. **Upper Limit**: Check if there is any official documentation or policy that sets an upper limit on the salaries for these positions.

Without specific data or official sources to confirm these details, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some level of factual information but lacks complete verification, we might consider it as partially accurate.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"The situation in energy deteriorates, investments are reduced",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The situation in energy deteriorates, investments are reduced,"" we need to consider the current state of the energy sector and investment trends.

1. **Energy Situation**: The energy sector is complex and varies by region and energy source (e.g., fossil fuels, renewables). Factors such as geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and policy changes can impact the energy situation. For instance, the war in Ukraine has affected global energy markets, leading to higher prices and supply concerns.

2. **Investments**: Investment trends in the energy sector can also vary. While investments in fossil fuels might be declining due to environmental concerns and policy shifts towards renewable energy, investments in renewable energy sources have been increasing. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy investment has been shifting towards cleaner energy technologies.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat nuanced. While certain areas of the energy sector may be facing challenges and reduced investments (e.g., fossil fuels), other areas (e.g., renewables) are seeing increased investments.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Georgia's credit rating has improved,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Georgia's credit rating has improved,"" we need to verify the most recent credit rating assessments from major credit rating agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's (S&P), and Fitch Ratings. These agencies periodically review and update their credit ratings for various entities, including states.

If recent reports from these agencies indicate an upgrade in Georgia's credit rating, the claim would be 'True.' If the reports show no change or a downgrade, the claim would be 'False.' If the information is mixed or not entirely clear, the claim might fall into one of the intermediate categories like 'Mostly True,' 'Half True,' or 'Mostly False.'

Given that I don't have real-time access to the latest credit rating reports, I can't provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to recent credit rating updates for Georgia and they show an improvement, you can conclude:

Final Answer: True

If the updates show no improvement or a downgrade, you can conclude:

Final Answer: False",,False,True
"Within the framework of the program ""Produce in Georgia"", 12 p.",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Within the framework of the program 'Produce in Georgia', 12 p."", we need more context and specific information. The claim is incomplete and lacks details about what ""12 p."" refers to. It could mean 12 projects, 12 products, 12 participants, or something else entirely. Without additional context or clarification, it is impossible to verify the claim.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"“As you know, there has been no Georgia still there and there is still no crisis management center ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""There has been no Georgia still there"" - This part of the claim is ambiguous and lacks context. If it refers to the U.S. state of Georgia or the country of Georgia, both still exist. Therefore, this statement is false.

2. ""There is still no crisis management center"" - This part of the claim is also ambiguous without additional context. If it refers to a specific crisis management center in Georgia (state or country), we would need more information to verify its existence or non-existence. However, generally speaking, both the state of Georgia and the country of Georgia have crisis management centers or equivalent institutions.

Given the lack of clarity and the factual inaccuracies in the first part of the claim, the overall statement is misleading.

2020-04-30T10: 55: 55Z,false,ka,"To determine the truthfulness of the claim '2020-04-30T10: 55: 55Z', we need to assess whether this string is a valid ISO 8601 date and time format.

The string '2020-04-30T10: 55: 55Z' appears to be an attempt at an ISO 8601 date and time format, which typically looks like 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ'. However, there are spaces after the colons in the time portion ('10: 55: 55'), which makes it an invalid ISO 8601 format.

A correct ISO 8601 format would be '2020-04-30T10:55:55Z' without any spaces.

"Compared to 2006, Georgia has improved from the 100th to 6th place in the Doing Business rating ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Compared to 2006, Georgia has improved from the 100th to 6th place in the Doing Business rating,"" we need to verify the historical rankings of Georgia in the World Bank's Doing Business reports.

1. **2006 Ranking**: According to the World Bank's Doing Business report, Georgia was ranked 100th in 2006.
2. **Recent Ranking**: In the Doing Business 2020 report, Georgia was ranked 7th. However, the claim states 6th place, which might be a slight discrepancy.

Given this information, the claim is very close to being accurate but has a minor inaccuracy regarding the exact recent ranking.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
"According to the law, the budget should be presented by the Prime Minister in parliament, but Giorgi Kvirikashvili does not ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the specific legal and procedural requirements for budget presentation in the relevant jurisdiction, as well as the role of Giorgi Kvirikashvili.

1. **Legal Requirement**: In many parliamentary systems, the budget is typically presented by the Finance Minister or a similar official, not necessarily the Prime Minister. The exact requirement can vary by country.

2. **Role of Giorgi Kvirikashvili**: Giorgi Kvirikashvili served as the Prime Minister of Georgia from December 30, 2015, to June 13, 2018. During his tenure, the presentation of the budget would follow the legal and procedural norms of Georgia.

3. **Georgia's Procedure**: In Georgia, the budget is usually presented by the Minister of Finance, not the Prime Minister. Therefore, if the claim is that the law requires the Prime Minister to present the budget, this would be incorrect.

Given this context, the claim that ""the budget should be presented by the Prime Minister in parliament, but Giorgi Kvirikashvili does not"" is not accurate based on the standard procedures in Georgia.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
New initiatives in the 2017 budget are not reflected in election legislation,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""New initiatives in the 2017 budget are not reflected in election legislation,"" we need to consider the relationship between budget initiatives and election legislation.

1. **Budget Initiatives**: These are typically financial plans and allocations for various government programs and projects. They outline how the government intends to spend its money in the upcoming fiscal year.

2. **Election Legislation**: This refers to laws and regulations governing the conduct of elections, including campaign finance, voting procedures, and electoral boundaries.

The claim suggests that the new initiatives introduced in the 2017 budget do not have any impact on or are not included in the election-related laws and regulations.

To evaluate this:

- **Budget and Legislation**: Generally, budget initiatives are separate from election legislation. Budget initiatives focus on financial allocations and policy priorities, while election legislation focuses on the rules and regulations governing elections.
- **Overlap**: There can be instances where budget allocations might indirectly affect election processes (e.g., funding for election security or voter education), but these are typically not considered part of election legislation itself.

Given this understanding, the claim that ""New initiatives in the 2017 budget are not reflected in election legislation"" is generally accurate because budget initiatives and election legislation are distinct areas of governance.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"Compared to the previous government, the economy is at least twice the pace increased in all directions",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Compared to the previous government, the economy is at least twice the pace increased in all directions,"" we need to evaluate several factors:

1. **Economic Growth Rate**: We need to compare the GDP growth rates during the current government and the previous government. If the current growth rate is at least twice that of the previous government, this part of the claim could be true.

2. **""All Directions""**: This phrase implies that all economic indicators (e.g., employment, inflation, trade balance, industrial production, etc.) have improved at twice the pace. This is a broad and ambitious claim that requires comprehensive data across multiple economic metrics.

3. **Time Frame**: The comparison should be made over similar time frames to ensure fairness. For example, comparing the first two years of the current government to the last two years of the previous government.

Without specific data and a detailed analysis of these factors, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, such sweeping statements are often exaggerated and may not hold true across all economic indicators.

Given the broad and ambitious nature of the claim and the likelihood that not all economic indicators have improved at twice the pace, the claim is likely to be an overstatement.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"With the decisions of the Mayor of Poti, the budget has a loss of hundreds of thousands of GEL",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""With the decisions of the Mayor of Poti, the budget has a loss of hundreds of thousands of GEL,"" we would need to verify several key points:

1. **Source of Information**: Is there credible evidence or official reports that support the claim?
2. **Specific Decisions**: What specific decisions made by the Mayor are being referred to, and how have they impacted the budget?
3. **Financial Data**: Are there financial records or audits that show a loss of hundreds of thousands of GEL directly attributable to the Mayor's decisions?

Without access to this specific information, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verified financial reports and credible sources, it could be considered accurate. Conversely, if there is no substantial evidence or the claim is based on speculation, it would be less accurate.

Given the lack of specific details and evidence provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I would categorize it as:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Compared to 2012, the remuneration of the Ministry of Justice increased by GEL 20 million when ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Compared to 2012, the remuneration of the Ministry of Justice increased by GEL 20 million,"" we need to verify the actual remuneration figures for the Ministry of Justice in both 2012 and the year being compared.

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain the remuneration figures for the Ministry of Justice for 2012 and the year in question.
2. **Comparison**: Calculate the difference between the two figures.
3. **Verification**: Ensure the difference is indeed GEL 20 million.

Without the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data is accurate and the difference is exactly GEL 20 million, the claim would be 'True'. If the difference is close but not exactly GEL 20 million, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the difference is significantly different, it could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming the data is accurate:

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
Budget revenues are at a historic maximum,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Budget revenues are at a historic maximum,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Data**: We need to compare current budget revenues with historical data to see if they are indeed at their highest point ever.
2. **Inflation Adjustment**: It's important to adjust for inflation to ensure that we are comparing revenues in real terms rather than nominal terms.
3. **Context**: Understanding the context, such as economic conditions, tax policies, and other factors that might influence budget revenues, is crucial.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent data and has been adjusted for inflation, it could be plausible. 

Given the lack of specific data in this context, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"Compared to 2012, in 2019 we will spend 580 million GEL more on bureaucracy",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Compared to 2012, in 2019 we will spend 580 million GEL more on bureaucracy,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The actual spending on bureaucracy in 2012.
2. The actual spending on bureaucracy in 2019.
3. The difference between the two amounts.

If the difference is indeed 580 million GEL, the claim would be 'True'. If the difference is close but not exactly 580 million GEL, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the difference is somewhat close but not very precise, it could be 'Half True'. If the difference is significantly different, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data on the spending amounts for 2012 and 2019, it is challenging to make a precise determination. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate data and the difference is exactly 580 million GEL, the claim would be 'True'.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
In 2002 Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International noted that Koba Narchemashvili Torture and ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In 2002 Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International noted that Koba Narchemashvili Torture and ..."", I would need to verify the specific reports or statements made by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International in 2002 regarding Koba Narchemashvili. 

Without access to the specific reports or statements, I cannot definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if such reports or statements do exist and they specifically mention Koba Narchemashvili in the context of torture, then the claim would be accurate.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I cannot make a definitive judgment.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
50% of our population lives in poverty,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""50% of our population lives in poverty,"" we need to consider the context and the source of the data. The definition of poverty can vary significantly between countries and organizations, and the percentage of the population living in poverty can change over time due to economic conditions, policy changes, and other factors.

1. **Contextual Analysis**: 
   - If the claim is about a specific country, we need to look at the most recent and reliable data from sources such as government reports, international organizations (e.g., World Bank, United Nations), or reputable research institutions.
   - If the claim is about the global population, we need to refer to global poverty statistics from organizations like the World Bank.

2. **Data Verification**:
   - For example, according to the World Bank, as of recent years, the global extreme poverty rate (people living on less than $1.90 a day) is significantly lower than 50%. However, poverty rates can be higher in specific countries or regions.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Without specific data or context, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, based on general knowledge and available global statistics, it is unlikely that 50% of the global population lives in poverty by the most common definitions.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"If you export tomatoes from Georgia to Turkey, you have 300% taxpay, and when tomatoes enter, the levy is ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that exporting tomatoes from Georgia to Turkey incurs a 300% tax and a levy upon entry, we need to verify the current trade policies and tariffs between Georgia and Turkey.

1. **Export Tax from Georgia**: Typically, countries do not impose export taxes on agricultural products like tomatoes. Export taxes are more common on raw materials or commodities where the country wants to encourage domestic processing.

2. **Import Tariff in Turkey**: Import tariffs can vary widely depending on trade agreements, product type, and other factors. A 300% import tariff on tomatoes would be unusually high and would likely be documented in trade agreements or tariff schedules.

3. **Trade Agreements**: Both Georgia and Turkey are part of various trade agreements that might influence tariffs. For instance, Turkey is part of the Customs Union with the EU, and Georgia has a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) with the EU, which might affect bilateral trade terms.

Given the lack of specific evidence supporting a 300% tax and additional levy, and considering standard international trade practices, the claim seems highly exaggerated.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"The share of loans in dollars is reduced to 58%, the government team successfully successfully the larization reform ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The share of loans in dollars has indeed been reduced to 58%.
2. The government team successfully implemented a larization reform.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and the government did implement a reform that led to this reduction, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the phrasing ""successfully successfully,"" which seems like a typographical error, it does not affect the factual content of the claim.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"In 2014-2016 we have fully restored all kindergartens in Telavi, for which I am 400,000 GEL ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether all kindergartens in Telavi were fully restored between 2014 and 2016.
2. Whether the amount spent on these restorations was 400,000 GEL.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these details, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is being evaluated based on available information and typical fact-checking standards, we can make an educated guess.

Given that the claim involves specific details about the restoration of all kindergartens and a precise amount of money, it is likely that some elements of the claim could be verified or disproven with proper records. If there is no evidence to support the full restoration of all kindergartens or the exact amount mentioned, the claim would be less accurate.

Based on the need for verification and the specificity of the claim, it is reasonable to categorize it as 'Half True' if there is partial evidence supporting some aspects but not all.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The Georgian government has decided to stop supplying electricity to the population of Abkhazia,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Georgian government has decided to stop supplying electricity to the population of Abkhazia,"" we need to consider the context and the most recent developments in the region.

1. **Background Information**: Abkhazia is a region that declared independence from Georgia in the early 1990s, but its independence is not widely recognized internationally. Georgia considers Abkhazia to be part of its territory, although it has limited control over the region.

2. **Electricity Supply**: Historically, the supply of electricity to Abkhazia has been a contentious issue. Abkhazia has relied on the Enguri Dam, which is located on the border between Georgia and Abkhazia, for its electricity. The dam is operated by Georgia, but a portion of the electricity generated is supplied to Abkhazia.

3. **Recent Developments**: There have been reports and discussions about the Georgian government considering changes to the electricity supply arrangements due to various reasons, including technical issues, financial constraints, and political considerations.

4. **Verification**: To verify the specific claim, we would need to look at recent official statements or actions taken by the Georgian government regarding the electricity supply to Abkhazia. If there is an official announcement or credible report confirming that the Georgian government has indeed decided to stop supplying electricity, the claim would be true. Otherwise, it would be false or partially true depending on the specifics.

Given the complexity and the need for up-to-date information, the claim's accuracy can vary. However, based on the general understanding and the lack of a definitive, widely reported decision by the Georgian government to completely stop supplying electricity to Abkhazia, the claim appears to be exaggerated or not fully accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Human rights are not violated in our penitentiary system ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Human rights are not violated in our penitentiary system,"" we need to consider various factors and evidence related to human rights conditions in penitentiary systems.

1. **Reports and Studies**: Numerous reports from human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, often document instances of human rights violations in penitentiary systems around the world. These violations can include overcrowding, inadequate medical care, abuse by prison staff, and poor living conditions.

2. **Legal Standards**: International human rights standards, such as those set by the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules), provide guidelines for the treatment of prisoners. Many penitentiary systems fall short of these standards.

3. **Country-Specific Data**: The situation can vary significantly from one country to another. In some countries, there may be fewer documented violations, while in others, the issues may be more severe and widespread.

4. **Recent Incidents**: News reports and investigations often reveal ongoing issues within penitentiary systems, including cases of torture, lack of access to legal representation, and other forms of mistreatment.

Given the widespread documentation of human rights issues in penitentiary systems globally, it is unlikely that any system is entirely free of human rights violations.

1. Whether Kakha Kaladze indeed made the statement that 17 blocks already have gas.
2. Whether it is true that none of the blocks actually have gas.

If both points are verified and found to be accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If the statement was made but the actual situation is different, the claim would be 'False'. If there is partial truth to either the statement or the situation, it could fall into one of the intermediate categories.

Without specific evidence or verification from reliable sources, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the information provided:

- If Kakha Kaladze did make the statement and it is confirmed that none of the blocks have gas, the claim is 'True'.
- If Kakha Kaladze did not make the statement or if some blocks do have gas, the claim would be 'False' or fall into one of the intermediate categories.

Given the lack of specific evidence in the provided information, I will assume the claim is presented as is without additional context.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there are reliable sources or surveys that have documented the satisfaction levels of Eco-migrants in the 'Dream City' of Khelvachauri.
2. **Contextual Evidence**: Look for any reports, news articles, or official statements that provide insights into the living conditions and satisfaction levels of the residents.
3. **Contradictory Evidence**: Identify if there are any reports or complaints from the residents that contradict the claim of satisfaction.

Without specific data or sources to verify the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that there is no substantial evidence to support or refute the claim, we might consider it as 'Half True' due to the lack of comprehensive information.

"We had a 700 million investment from India, and more than 1 billion from South Korea from South Korea",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific investment amounts mentioned: $700 million from India and more than $1 billion from South Korea. This requires checking reliable sources such as financial news, investment reports, or official statements from relevant authorities.

Without access to real-time data or specific sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent and accurate information, it could be evaluated as follows:

- If both investment amounts are accurate and have been confirmed by reliable sources, the claim would be 'True'.
- If one of the amounts is slightly off but generally correct, the claim might be 'Mostly True'.
- If there is a significant discrepancy in one or both amounts, the claim could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.
- If both amounts are incorrect or there is no evidence of such investments, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific verification in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on some factual basis, a cautious approach would be:

"""About 80 tons of rice were brought to Georgia for the first time this year""",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""About 80 tons of rice were brought to Georgia for the first time this year,"" we need to verify two key points:

1. Whether 80 tons of rice were indeed brought to Georgia this year.
2. Whether this is the first time rice has been brought to Georgia.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable source, we can make an educated guess.

Given that rice importation is a common practice and Georgia has likely imported rice in previous years, the part of the claim stating ""for the first time this year"" seems questionable. Therefore, the claim is likely exaggerated or misleading.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
In 2016-2017 it will have one of the highest economic growth in the region of Georgia,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In 2016-2017 it will have one of the highest economic growth in the region of Georgia,"" we need to look at the economic growth data for Georgia and its neighboring regions during that period.

According to the World Bank and other economic reports, Georgia experienced significant economic growth in 2016 and 2017. The country's GDP growth rates were approximately 2.8% in 2016 and 4.8% in 2017. These growth rates were relatively high compared to some of its neighboring countries in the South Caucasus region, such as Armenia and Azerbaijan, which faced economic challenges during the same period.

Given this context, the claim that Georgia had one of the highest economic growth rates in its region during 2016-2017 is supported by the data.

I requested public information from Batumi City Hall in 2015 and received an answer a year later,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I requested public information from Batumi City Hall in 2015 and received an answer a year later,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Request Date**: The claim states that the request was made in 2015.
2. **Response Time**: The claim states that the response was received a year later, which would be in 2016.

If both of these points are accurate, then the claim would be 'True'. However, without specific evidence or documentation to verify the exact dates of the request and the response, it is challenging to confirm the claim with absolute certainty.

Given the information provided and assuming no additional context or evidence is available to dispute the claim, the most appropriate classification would be 'True' based on the details given.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False

The statement in question is: ""You say that as a result of the Spring Work Support Program has not increased the crop area, though this is not the case.""

The claim suggests that the Spring Work Support Program has indeed increased the crop area, contrary to what was previously stated. 

Without additional context or data to verify the actual impact of the Spring Work Support Program on the crop area, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the information given, the claim asserts that the program has increased the crop area, which contradicts the initial statement that it has not.

Given this contradiction and assuming the claim is based on accurate information, the claim would be:

   - This text appears to be a mix of Portuguese and some garbled or incomplete sentences. However, some parts can be understood:
     - ""O Congresso é o mais alto do poder legislativo do Brasil"" translates to ""The Congress is the highest legislative power in Brazil,"" which is true.
     - ""Cada Estado Tem O Mesmo Número de Senadores (Três)"" translates to ""Each state has the same number of Senators (three),"" which is also true.
     - ""Para a rejeição do veto necessária a maioria absoluta dos votos de deputados"" translates to ""For the rejection of the veto, an absolute majority of the votes of deputies is necessary,"" which is true in the context of Brazilian legislative procedures.

"In the three quarters of 2015, investments decreased by 17%.Investments are reduced in agriculture d ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether investments decreased by 17% in the first three quarters of 2015.
2. Whether investments were reduced in agriculture during that period.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume the information provided is accurate and there are no additional details that contradict it, we can make an educated guess.

Given the structure of the statement, it seems to be presenting two related but distinct pieces of information:
- A 17% decrease in overall investments.
- A reduction in investments specifically in agriculture.

If we assume the first part (17% decrease) is accurate and the second part (reduction in agriculture) is also accurate, the claim would be 'True'. However, if there is any doubt or lack of evidence for either part, the accuracy could be less certain.

Based on the information provided and without additional context or data, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Women's involvement in self-government bodies is very low,"" we need to consider the context and available data on women's participation in self-government bodies.

1. **Context**: The claim suggests a severe problem (""catastrophic situation"") and specifically points to low women's involvement in self-government bodies.

2. **Data**: 
   - If data shows that women's participation in self-government bodies is significantly lower than men's, the claim about low involvement could be accurate.
   - The term ""catastrophic"" is subjective and implies a very severe problem, which might be harder to quantify without specific criteria.

3. **Verification**:
   - If statistics or reports from credible sources (e.g., government reports, academic studies, or reputable NGOs) confirm that women's participation is indeed very low, the claim about low involvement is supported.
   - The severity of the situation being ""catastrophic"" would depend on additional qualitative assessments, such as the impact of low participation on governance and community outcomes.

Given the information provided and without specific data to confirm or refute the exact severity described as ""catastrophic,"" but acknowledging that low women's involvement in self-government bodies is a recognized issue in many regions:

3. **Previous Month's Report**: Review the financial report from the previous month to confirm the stated changes.

Without specific data or context, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the statement is based on actual financial reports and trends, it could be considered accurate. 

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate response based on the information provided would be:

3. **Historical Interactions**: What has been the historical relationship between the National Bank and the IMF? Have there been previous instances where the National Bank has successfully implemented IMF recommendations?

Without specific evidence or context, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if there is no substantial evidence suggesting a lack of understanding, the claim would likely be considered speculative or unfounded.

"“We are a political team whose budget has increased 10 times, 7-8%of the economy ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are a political team whose budget has increased 10 times, 7-8% of the economy,"" we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the budget of the political team has indeed increased tenfold.
2. Whether this budget now constitutes 7-8% of the economy.

Without specific data or context, such as the time frame over which the budget increased, the initial budget amount, the current budget amount, and the size of the economy, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, given the significant increase implied (a tenfold increase) and the substantial portion of the economy (7-8%), such a claim would generally require robust evidence.

Given the lack of specific data to verify these points, the claim cannot be fully substantiated or refuted based on the information provided.

This would involve checking credible news sources, official statements, or public records.

"Every seventh person in the country borrowed money with money, and every third person is ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Every seventh person in the country borrowed money with money, and every third person is ..."", we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Every seventh person in the country borrowed money with money.""
2. ""Every third person is ...""

For the first part, without specific data or context about the country in question, it is difficult to verify the exact proportion of people who have borrowed money. However, the phrasing ""borrowed money with money"" is unclear and could be interpreted in various ways, making it ambiguous.

For the second part, the statement is incomplete (""every third person is ...""), so it cannot be evaluated for truthfulness.

Given the ambiguity and the incomplete nature of the claim, it is not possible to verify its accuracy.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"According to David Sergeenko, you got a change in prices for medicines by a survey of Geostat population ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. Who David Sergeenko is and his relevance to the topic.
2. Whether Geostat (presumably a statistical agency) conducts surveys on medicine prices.
3. If the change in medicine prices was indeed reported by a survey of the Geostat population.

David Sergeenko is a known public figure, often associated with health-related matters in Georgia. Geostat is the National Statistics Office of Georgia, which conducts various surveys, including those related to prices and inflation.

If David Sergeenko mentioned that the change in medicine prices was identified through a survey conducted by Geostat, and if Geostat indeed conducts such surveys, then the claim would be accurate.

Given the information available:

1. David Sergeenko is a credible source in the context of health and medicine.
2. Geostat does conduct surveys that could include medicine prices.

Therefore, the claim appears to be accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
“The cost of the 2013 budget was GEL 703 million.Tax revenues with 633 million GEL ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the figures provided for the 2013 budget cost and tax revenues in GEL (Georgian Lari). 

1. **Budget Cost**: The claim states that the cost of the 2013 budget was GEL 703 million.
2. **Tax Revenues**: The claim states that tax revenues were GEL 633 million.

Without access to the specific financial records or official government reports from Georgia for the year 2013, it is challenging to definitively verify these figures. However, if we assume the figures are accurate based on available data or credible sources, we can evaluate the claim.

Given the information provided in the claim:
- The budget cost is GEL 703 million.
- Tax revenues are GEL 633 million.

If these figures are correct, the claim would be 'True'. However, if there is any discrepancy in the figures, the claim could range from 'Mostly True' to 'False' depending on the extent of the inaccuracy.

Since I do not have the exact data to confirm or refute these figures, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. Therefore, I would need to rely on the assumption that the figures are accurate as stated.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False

In the 2016 parliamentary elections in Georgia, the Georgian Dream party won a significant majority. According to official results, the Georgian Dream party secured 115 out of 150 seats in the Parliament of Georgia.

Given this information, the claim that the Georgian Dream received only 12 seats in the 2016 election is incorrect.

"The Ukrainian authorities have said that the Russian language should be banned, and all who speak Russian in Russian should be banned ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Ukrainian authorities have said that the Russian language should be banned, and all who speak Russian in Russian should be banned,"" we need to examine the policies and statements made by Ukrainian authorities regarding the Russian language.

1. **Language Policy in Ukraine**: Ukraine has implemented policies to promote the use of the Ukrainian language, especially in public life, education, and media. For example, the 2019 language law mandates the use of Ukrainian in most aspects of public life, but it does not ban the Russian language outright.

2. **Statements by Ukrainian Authorities**: There have been no official statements from Ukrainian authorities advocating for a complete ban on the Russian language or banning individuals who speak Russian. The focus has been on promoting Ukrainian as the state language while allowing the use of minority languages, including Russian, in private and some public settings.

3. **Context of the Claim**: The claim may stem from misunderstandings or misrepresentations of Ukraine's language policies. While there is a push to strengthen the use of Ukrainian, it does not equate to banning the Russian language or its speakers.

Based on the available information, the claim that Ukrainian authorities have said the Russian language should be banned and all who speak Russian should be banned is not supported by evidence.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
The state will spend 15 million GEL on Abastumani's amenities,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The state will spend 15 million GEL on Abastumani's amenities,"" we need to verify the information from reliable sources such as government announcements, official budgets, or credible news reports.

1. **Check Government Announcements**: Look for any official statements or press releases from the Georgian government or relevant ministries that confirm the allocation of 15 million GEL for amenities in Abastumani.
2. **Review Official Budgets**: Examine the state budget documents to see if there is a line item or allocation specifically for Abastumani's amenities amounting to 15 million GEL.
3. **Consult Credible News Sources**: Search for news articles from reputable media outlets that report on the funding for Abastumani's amenities and verify if the amount mentioned is 15 million GEL.

If the claim is supported by these sources, it can be considered true. If there are discrepancies or lack of evidence, the claim's accuracy may vary.

Without access to these specific sources at this moment, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if you have access to such information and it confirms the allocation, you can determine the accuracy accordingly.

The water in Khelvachauri is pulled out but not a drink,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The water in Khelvachauri is pulled out but not a drink,"" we need to consider the context and the specifics of the water situation in Khelvachauri, a municipality in Georgia.

1. **Water Source and Usage**: If the water is being extracted (pulled out) for purposes other than drinking, such as for irrigation, industrial use, or other non-potable purposes, the claim could be accurate.
2. **Water Quality**: If the water quality in Khelvachauri is not suitable for drinking due to contamination or other issues, this would also support the claim.
3. **Local Practices**: Understanding local practices regarding water usage can provide insight into whether the water is typically used for drinking or not.

Without specific, detailed information about the water quality and usage in Khelvachauri, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general understanding that water in many regions can be used for various purposes and may not always be potable, we can make an educated assessment.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Half of Georgia's population does not have gas, firewood is heated",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Half of Georgia's population does not have gas, firewood is heated,"" we need to examine available data on energy sources and heating methods in Georgia.

1. **Natural Gas Access**: According to various reports and data from organizations like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Bank, a significant portion of Georgia's population does have access to natural gas. However, there are rural and remote areas where access to natural gas is limited.

2. **Heating Methods**: In areas without natural gas, alternative heating methods such as firewood, electricity, and other fuels are commonly used. Firewood is indeed a traditional and widely used heating source in rural areas.

3. **Statistical Data**: Specific statistics on the exact percentage of the population without natural gas access can vary, but it is generally not as high as 50%. Reports suggest that while a notable portion of the rural population may rely on firewood, the overall percentage of the entire population without gas is likely lower than half.

Given this information, the claim that ""Half of Georgia's population does not have gas, firewood is heated"" seems to overstate the situation. While it is true that a significant number of people, especially in rural areas, may not have access to natural gas and use firewood, the figure of ""half"" appears to be an exaggeration.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
We only get debt to finance infrastructure projects,mostly true,ka,"The claim ""We only get debt to finance infrastructure projects"" is not entirely accurate. Governments and organizations can incur debt for a variety of reasons beyond just infrastructure projects. These reasons can include financing budget deficits, funding social programs, covering operational costs, managing cash flow, and responding to emergencies or economic downturns.

The 24th place of Georgia's shift in the ranking of business has led to a change in methodology,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The 24th place of Georgia's shift in the ranking of business has led to a change in methodology,"" we need to consider the context and details surrounding Georgia's ranking and any changes in methodology.

1. **Georgia's Ranking**: Georgia has been recognized for its business-friendly environment and has often ranked highly in various business and economic indices. However, the specific ranking of 24th place needs to be verified against a credible source, such as the World Bank's Doing Business report or other reputable business rankings.

2. **Change in Methodology**: Changes in methodology for business rankings can occur for various reasons, including the need to improve accuracy, address biases, or reflect new economic realities. If a change in methodology was indeed implemented, it would typically be documented and explained by the organization responsible for the ranking.

To verify the claim, we would need to:
- Check the specific ranking of Georgia in a recent and credible business index.
- Confirm if there was a change in the methodology of that index and whether it was attributed to Georgia's ranking.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, based on general knowledge and the need for precise verification, the claim appears to be speculative.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
The reduction of the amount of penalties in the budget was due to the reduction of the volume of penalties,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the relationship between the amount of penalties in the budget and the volume of penalties. The claim states that the reduction in the budgeted amount for penalties is due to a reduction in the volume of penalties.

If the volume of penalties (the number or severity of penalties) decreases, it logically follows that the total amount allocated for penalties in the budget would also decrease, assuming all other factors remain constant. Therefore, the claim appears to be logically consistent.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"The previous president pardoned 35,000 people, I - 3 500",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The previous president pardoned 35,000 people, I - 3,500,"" we need to verify the number of pardons issued by both the previous president and the current speaker.

1. **Previous President's Pardons**: 
   - Historically, U.S. presidents have not pardoned anywhere near 35,000 people. For example, President Barack Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations, and President Donald Trump issued 143 pardons and 94 commutations. These numbers are far below 35,000.

2. **Current Speaker's Pardons**:
   - If the current speaker is a recent U.S. president, such as Joe Biden, as of the latest data, he has issued very few pardons and commutations, certainly not 3,500.

Given the historical data on presidential pardons, the claim that the previous president pardoned 35,000 people is highly exaggerated, and the claim that the current speaker pardoned 3,500 people is also inaccurate.

"According to the World Bank report, Georgia's rating has improved and show me the record for the last 18 years ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""According to the World Bank report, Georgia's rating has improved and show me the record for the last 18 years,"" we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the World Bank report indicates that Georgia's rating has improved.
2. Whether there is a record available for the last 18 years.

The World Bank publishes various reports, including the Doing Business report, which ranks countries based on the ease of doing business. Georgia has been known to improve its ranking in these reports over the years.

To verify this claim, we would need to look at the specific World Bank reports over the last 18 years and check Georgia's rankings. If the data shows a general trend of improvement, the claim can be considered true.

However, without access to the specific data from the World Bank reports for the last 18 years, I cannot definitively confirm the claim. Based on general knowledge, Georgia has shown improvement in various World Bank indicators over the years.

1. Whether the previous government indeed sold a specially created company.
2. Whether the sale was conducted at a minimum price.
3. Any additional context or details that follow the initial statement.

Without specific details or evidence to support or refute these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the information provided, we can make an educated guess.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context, the claim appears to be somewhat vague and unsubstantiated. Therefore, it would be prudent to categorize it as 'Half True' since it contains elements that could be true but lacks sufficient detail to fully verify.

"According to the government, we received 355 million from investments, but 207 million of them on equipment ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify the details:

1. The government claims to have received 355 million from investments.
2. Out of this 355 million, 207 million was spent on equipment.

If both parts of the statement are accurate, then the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor inaccuracies or missing context, it might be 'Mostly True'. If there are significant inaccuracies or misleading elements, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Without additional context or verification of the specific figures from a reliable source, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the statement, it appears to be internally consistent.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"""As of 2014, exports have increased significantly ...""",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""As of 2014, exports have increased significantly,"" we would need specific data on export levels before and up to 2014. This data would typically come from reliable sources such as government trade reports, international trade organizations, or economic research institutions.

Without access to this specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and reliable data, it could be considered true. Conversely, if the data shows only a minor increase or a decrease in exports, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if we were to assume the claim is based on accurate data, the most appropriate response would be:

Final Answer: True",true,False,False

1. The content of the Venice Commission and OSCE reports regarding the last vote.
2. Whether there was indeed only one negative assessment in these reports.
3. If the individual in question was the sole provider of the negative assessment.

Without access to the specific reports from the Venice Commission and OSCE, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the reports are publicly available and can be checked, the process would involve:

- Reviewing the Venice Commission report on the last vote.
- Reviewing the OSCE report on the last vote.
- Identifying the number and nature of assessments (positive, neutral, negative) in these reports.
- Confirming if there was only one negative assessment and if it was attributed to the individual in question.

Given the lack of specific information and assuming a hypothetical scenario where the reports are accessible and the claim can be verified, the answer would depend on the findings from these reports.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have checked the reports and found multiple assessments, both positive and negative, from various sources.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"In the last five years, the population of Georgia has declined by 800,000 people: 4.5 million people - ""National ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the population of Georgia has declined by 800,000 people over the last five years, we need to look at reliable population data sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau or other official demographic statistics.

1. **Population Data Check**: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Georgia in 2020 was approximately 10.7 million people. If the claim states that the population has declined to 4.5 million, this would be a drastic and highly unlikely decrease.

2. **Verification**: A decline of 800,000 people from 10.7 million would result in a population of approximately 9.9 million, not 4.5 million. The figure of 4.5 million is not consistent with any recent data for the state of Georgia.

3. **Conclusion**: The claim that the population of Georgia has declined by 800,000 people to 4.5 million is not supported by any credible data sources.

2. Whether the construction was not completed as scheduled.

If both points are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If only one of the points is accurate, the claim would be 'Half True'. If neither point is accurate, the claim would be 'False'. If the claim is mostly accurate but has minor inaccuracies, it would be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the nature of the inaccuracies.

1. **Historical Debt (When Georgian Dream Took Office):**
   - Georgian Dream, a political party in Georgia, came to power in October 2012.
   - According to available data, the government debt of Georgia around that time was approximately GEL 8.5 billion.

1. The amount of money left in the Treasury account by the previous government.
2. The current volume of the Treasury account.

Without specific data or sources to verify these figures, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable data, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the previous government indeed left the Treasury account with up to GEL 2 billion and the current volume is 558 million, the claim would be accurate.
- If there is any discrepancy in these figures, the claim's accuracy would be affected.

"""The defendants have given many new rights""",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The defendants have given many new rights,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of the situation. Generally, defendants in legal contexts are individuals or entities accused of wrongdoing, and they are typically the recipients of rights rather than the givers of rights. Rights are usually granted by laws, courts, or governing bodies, not by the defendants themselves.

Given this understanding, the claim appears to be misleading because it suggests that defendants are in a position to grant rights, which is not typically the case.

1. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is a federal agency that has always been part of the U.S. government. It was established as a Cabinet-level department in 1989, evolving from the Veterans Administration, which was created in 1930.
2. There has been no recent event or change where the VA ""returned to the government"" because it has always been a government entity.

1. Whether there are indeed plans for the construction of 14 new schools in Adjara.
2. Whether there are plans for 23 schools in total (including the 14 new schools) in Adjara.

If both parts of the claim are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If only one part is accurate or if there are minor inaccuracies, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the claim is largely inaccurate, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data or sources to verify these details, I cannot definitively confirm the claim. However, if we assume the information provided is accurate based on reliable sources, the claim would be evaluated as follows:

- If 14 new schools are indeed planned and the total number of schools planned (including new and existing) is 23, the claim is 'True'.
- If 14 new schools are planned but the total number of schools planned is not 23, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

TBC Bank attracted not a direct investment but a portfolio investment.Foreign Invest ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the difference between direct investment and portfolio investment:

1. **Direct Investment**: This involves a long-term interest and control in a company, such as acquiring a significant portion of the company's shares or assets, often leading to a lasting management interest.

2. **Portfolio Investment**: This involves investing in a company's securities, such as stocks or bonds, without seeking control or a lasting interest in the company. It is typically more short-term and speculative.

The claim states that TBC Bank attracted a portfolio investment rather than a direct investment. If TBC Bank received investments in the form of securities without the investors seeking control or a long-term interest, then the claim would be accurate.

Without specific details about the nature of the investment TBC Bank received, we can only assess the claim based on the definitions provided. Assuming the claim is based on accurate information about the type of investment, it would be:

"The budget of the water supply company is increasing.In 2018 there were 166 million expenses, with 30%in 2019 ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The budget of the water supply company is increasing. In 2018 there were 166 million expenses, with 30% in 2019,"" we need to analyze the provided information.

1. **2018 Expenses**: 166 million.
2. **2019 Expenses**: The claim states ""with 30% in 2019,"" which is ambiguous. It could mean:
   - The expenses increased by 30% in 2019.
   - The expenses in 2019 were 30% of the 2018 expenses.

Let's consider both interpretations:

### Interpretation 1: 30% Increase in 2019
- 2018 Expenses: 166 million.
- 30% increase in 2019: \( 166 \times 0.30 = 49.8 \) million.
- 2019 Expenses: \( 166 + 49.8 = 215.8 \) million.

### Interpretation 2: 2019 Expenses are 30% of 2018 Expenses
- 2018 Expenses: 166 million.
- 2019 Expenses: \( 166 \times 0.30 = 49.8 \) million.

### Analysis
- If the first interpretation is correct, the budget is indeed increasing.
- If the second interpretation is correct, the budget is decreasing.

Given the ambiguity in the statement, we cannot definitively conclude that the budget is increasing without additional context. However, the phrase ""the budget of the water supply company is increasing"" suggests an upward trend, which aligns with the first interpretation.

### Conclusion
Given the ambiguity but leaning towards the interpretation that supports the claim of an increasing budget:

All crimes in Tbilisi have been opened this year,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""All crimes in Tbilisi have been opened this year,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of ""opened""**: If ""opened"" means that all crimes have been investigated or cases have been initiated, it is still highly unlikely that every single crime has been addressed due to the nature of crime reporting and investigation processes.

2. **Crime Statistics and Reporting**: Crime statistics are typically reported by law enforcement agencies. It is improbable that every single crime reported in a city, especially a large one like Tbilisi, has been fully investigated or resolved within a single year.

3. **Practicality**: In any city, there are always some crimes that remain unsolved or are under investigation for extended periods. The claim that ""all crimes"" have been opened suggests a 100% resolution rate, which is virtually impossible in real-world scenarios.

Given these considerations, the claim is highly unlikely to be true.

2. ""that used the proportional electoral system"" - Proportional electoral systems are used in many countries around the world, not just those related to Georgia.

3. ""mixed Saa ..."" - This part of the claim is incomplete and does not provide enough information to understand what is being referred to.

Given the ambiguity and lack of clarity in the claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy. The statement is not specific enough to be evaluated as true or false.

4. These hotels added 6 thousand rooms (assuming ""6 thousand"" refers to rooms).

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and verifiable data, it could be considered 'True'. If there are minor inaccuracies or slight exaggerations, it might be 'Mostly True'. If there are significant inaccuracies or the data is outdated, it could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'. If the claim is entirely incorrect, it would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute each point, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure and typical reporting of such statistics, it is reasonable to assume that there might be some truth to it, but also potential for minor inaccuracies.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The number of convicts for drug offenders is reduced,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The number of convicts for drug offenders is reduced,"" we need to consider recent data and trends in drug-related convictions. 

1. **Data Analysis**: 
   - If recent statistics from credible sources (e.g., government reports, criminal justice databases) show a consistent decline in the number of drug-related convictions over a significant period, the claim could be considered true.
   - If the data shows a mixed trend, with some years showing a decrease and others an increase, the claim might be considered partially true or half true.
   - If the data shows no significant change or an increase in drug-related convictions, the claim would be false.

2. **Contextual Factors**:
   - Changes in drug laws, such as decriminalization or legalization of certain substances, could impact the number of convictions.
   - Shifts in law enforcement priorities or practices could also influence the data.

Without specific and up-to-date data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that recent trends and reforms in many regions have led to a reduction in drug-related convictions, we might lean towards a positive assessment.

**Hypothetical Conclusion Based on General Trends**:
Given the general trend towards decriminalization and reform in many places, it is plausible that the number of drug-related convictions has decreased.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"“Today, new jobs are not created, but what is lost, and today the population is problematic ...",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Today, new jobs are not created, but what is lost, and today the population is problematic,"" we need to consider the current trends in job creation and population issues.

1. **Job Creation**: 
   - **True**: New jobs are being created in various sectors, especially in technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. However, automation and globalization have led to job losses in certain traditional industries.
   - **False**: The statement that ""new jobs are not created"" is inaccurate. According to data from labor statistics, new jobs are continually being created, although the nature and sectors of these jobs may be changing.

2. **Population Issues**:
   - **True**: There are indeed population-related challenges, such as aging populations in some countries, overpopulation in others, and migration issues. These can create economic and social pressures.

Given these points, the claim is a mix of accurate and inaccurate elements. While it is true that there are population challenges, the assertion that new jobs are not being created is incorrect.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"It's a lie, the Prime Minister does not sign such a thing",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""It's a lie, the Prime Minister does not sign such a thing,"" we need to consider the context and the specific document or action being referred to. The Prime Minister's role and the documents they sign can vary depending on the country and its governmental structure. 

In many parliamentary systems, the Prime Minister does sign certain types of documents, such as executive orders, official letters, and some forms of legislation. However, other documents might be signed by different officials, such as ministers or heads of specific departments.

Without specific context about what ""such a thing"" refers to, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, the general statement that the Prime Minister does not sign any documents at all is incorrect.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
What happens in relation to the lari rate is the result of a stir behavior,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""What happens in relation to the lari rate is the result of a stir behavior,"" we need to break down the components of the statement.

1. **Lari Rate**: The lari is the currency of Georgia. The ""lari rate"" typically refers to the exchange rate of the Georgian lari against other currencies.

2. **Stir Behavior**: This term is vague and not commonly used in economic contexts. It could imply market volatility, speculative actions, or other forms of economic disturbance.

Given the ambiguity of ""stir behavior,"" it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. Exchange rates can be influenced by a variety of factors, including economic policies, market speculation, geopolitical events, and more. If ""stir behavior"" is interpreted as market volatility or speculative actions, then it could be one of the factors affecting the lari rate, but it is not the sole determinant.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but overly simplistic and vague.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"In the first three months of 2017, about 20 cases of robbery occurred with armed penetration of the apartment, which and ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the specific data regarding the number of robbery cases with armed penetration of apartments in the first three months of 2017. This would typically involve consulting crime statistics from reliable sources such as law enforcement agencies or official crime reports for that period.

Without access to the specific data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided and the lack of verifiable data, I cannot confirm the accuracy of the statement.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Georgia in connection with the Law on Occupied Territories from International Organizations ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Georgia in connection with the Law on Occupied Territories from International Organizations,"" we need to consider the context and details surrounding Georgia's Law on Occupied Territories and its interactions with international organizations.

1. **Georgia's Law on Occupied Territories**: This law, enacted in 2008, regulates the legal status of the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which Georgia considers occupied by Russia. The law imposes restrictions on economic activities and travel in these regions without Georgian government permission.

2. **International Organizations' Involvement**: Various international organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), have been involved in addressing the situation in these territories. They have issued statements and resolutions supporting Georgia's territorial integrity and calling for peaceful resolution of the conflict.

Given these points, the claim that there is a connection between Georgia and international organizations regarding the Law on Occupied Territories is accurate. International organizations have indeed been involved in discussions and actions related to this law and the broader conflict.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"The Georgian Dream nominated a candidate in Gori, who was charged by the Prosecutor's Office and the preventive event ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Georgian Dream nominated a candidate in Gori, who was charged by the Prosecutor's Office and the preventive event ..."", we need to verify the following:

1. Whether the Georgian Dream party indeed nominated a candidate in Gori.
2. Whether this candidate was charged by the Prosecutor's Office.
3. Whether there was a preventive event related to this candidate.

Without specific details or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verified information, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the candidate was indeed nominated by the Georgian Dream party in Gori and was charged by the Prosecutor's Office, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there are some inaccuracies or missing details, such as the nature of the charges or the specifics of the preventive event, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context provided in the claim, it is prudent to err on the side of caution.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"""We have truly reduced penalties ... including the tax direction""",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have truly reduced penalties ... including the tax direction,"" we need to evaluate the context and evidence regarding the reduction of penalties, specifically in the area of taxes.

1. **Context**: The claim suggests that there has been a reduction in penalties, with a specific mention of tax-related penalties.
2. **Evidence**: To verify this, we would need to look at recent legislative changes, policy updates, or official statements from relevant authorities (e.g., tax agencies) that confirm a reduction in penalties, including those related to taxes.

Without specific evidence or context provided in the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that there have been recent policy changes or legislative actions that support this claim, we can make an informed judgment.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, but assuming there is some basis for the claim, the most cautious and balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
“The number of recipients of socially disadvantaged status was significantly increasing during each election ... this ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The number of recipients of socially disadvantaged status was significantly increasing during each election,"" we would need to examine empirical data and trends over multiple election cycles. This would involve looking at official statistics and reports from relevant government agencies or credible research studies that track the number of individuals receiving socially disadvantaged status over time.

Without access to specific data or sources to verify this claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that the claim is based on observable trends and there is no contradictory evidence, we might lean towards a certain level of truth. 

Given the lack of specific data provided in the question, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Administrative costs in Adjara 2017 budget are reduced,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Administrative costs in Adjara 2017 budget are reduced,"" we need to examine the budget data for Adjara in 2017 and compare it to previous years. This involves looking at official budget documents or credible reports that detail the administrative costs for the relevant years.

1. **Data Collection**: Gather the budget documents for Adjara for the years 2016 and 2017.
2. **Comparison**: Compare the administrative costs listed in these documents.
3. **Verification**: Ensure the data is from a reliable source, such as government publications or reputable financial analysis.

Without access to the specific budget documents or credible reports, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified data, we can proceed with the following:

- If the administrative costs in 2017 are indeed lower than in 2016, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the reduction is minor or there are other significant factors to consider, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.
- If the costs are not reduced or have increased, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the question and assuming the claim is based on accurate data:

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"""You can't name any occasion where foreign companies have hidden hearing keys.""",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""You can't name any occasion where foreign companies have hidden hearing keys,"" we need to consider the context and the specific terminology used. The phrase ""hearing keys"" is not a standard term in common usage, so it might be a misinterpretation or a specific jargon that is not widely recognized.

However, if we interpret ""hearing keys"" to mean critical information or backdoors in software or hardware, there have been documented instances where foreign companies have been accused of hiding such elements. For example, there have been concerns and allegations about certain foreign technology companies embedding backdoors in their products for surveillance purposes.

Given this interpretation, the claim that no such occasion exists is not accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"""In 2013, for the first time in Georgia, the health budget has doubled, we have not had a precedent""",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In 2013, for the first time in Georgia, the health budget has doubled, we have not had a precedent,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The health budget for Georgia in 2013.
2. The health budget for Georgia in the previous year (2012).
3. Historical data to see if there was any precedent of the health budget doubling in previous years.

If the health budget in 2013 was indeed double that of 2012 and there was no previous instance of the health budget doubling, the claim would be true. If the budget increased significantly but not doubled, or if there was a previous instance of the budget doubling, the claim would be less accurate.

Without specific data, we can only hypothesize based on general knowledge. However, for a precise answer, we would need to look at the actual budget figures from official sources.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, we cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"“There are slightly more than 2000 schools in Georgia and after seven months of competition, only 900 are certified ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The total number of schools in Georgia.
2. The number of schools that are certified after seven months of competition.

According to the Georgia Department of Education, there are indeed slightly more than 2,000 public schools in Georgia. This includes elementary, middle, and high schools.

However, without specific information on what ""certified"" refers to in this context (e.g., a particular certification program, competition, or standard), and without data on the number of schools that have achieved this certification, it is challenging to verify the second part of the claim.

Given the lack of specific data on the certification aspect, we cannot fully confirm the accuracy of the entire statement. Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable but lacks complete evidence for full verification.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Badri Basishvili: Georgian Dream's three contractors of Gori City Hall in the last 2 years 250 thousand ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Badri Basishvili: Georgian Dream's three contractors of Gori City Hall in the last 2 years 250 thousand ..."", we need to verify several key points:

1. **Identity and Role of Badri Basishvili**: Confirm if Badri Basishvili is associated with Georgian Dream and has made statements regarding contractors of Gori City Hall.
2. **Number of Contractors**: Verify if there are indeed three contractors associated with Gori City Hall.
3. **Time Frame**: Check if the time frame mentioned is accurate (the last 2 years).
4. **Financial Amount**: Confirm if the total amount involved is 250 thousand (currency not specified, but likely Georgian Lari).

Without access to specific data or sources, it's challenging to verify these details conclusively. However, if we assume the claim is based on publicly available information and there are no significant disputes or corrections from reliable sources, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific evidence to either fully confirm or refute the claim, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"International Edition ""Global Finance"" was published, where Georgia is 10 most attractive ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the ""International Edition 'Global Finance' was published, where Georgia is 10 most attractive,"" we need to verify the following:

1. Whether there is a publication called ""Global Finance"" that has an international edition.
2. Whether this publication has ranked Georgia among the 10 most attractive in any specific category.

Without specific details or access to the latest publications of ""Global Finance,"" it is challenging to confirm the exact claim. However, based on general knowledge, ""Global Finance"" is a reputable magazine that often publishes rankings and reports on various financial and economic metrics.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support the exact claim as stated, it is difficult to fully verify its accuracy.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Georgia is one of the worst countries in terms of environmental protection.Yale University Account M ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgia is one of the worst countries in terms of environmental protection,"" we need to refer to credible sources that rank countries based on their environmental performance. One such source is the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) published by Yale University.

The EPI ranks countries on various environmental health and ecosystem vitality metrics. If Georgia ranks very low on this index, the claim could be considered accurate. Conversely, if Georgia's ranking is not among the worst, the claim would be inaccurate.

As of the most recent EPI report, Georgia is not ranked among the worst countries in terms of environmental protection. While it may have areas needing improvement, it does not fall into the category of the worst-performing nations.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"None of the projects have been implemented in Bolnisi, local level since 2012",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""None of the projects have been implemented in Bolnisi, local level since 2012,"" we would need to verify whether any projects have indeed been implemented in Bolnisi at the local level since 2012. This would involve checking records, reports, or other sources of information that document local projects in Bolnisi over the specified period.

Without access to specific data or records, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is being evaluated based on available information and no projects have been documented or reported in Bolnisi since 2012, the claim would be considered 'True'. Conversely, if there is evidence of even a single project being implemented, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we were to assume that no projects have been reported or documented, the claim would be:

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
“It is an internationally recognized criterion that one of the parameters of self-governing cities ...,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""It is an internationally recognized criterion that one of the parameters of self-governing cities ..."", we need to consider the context and the specific criterion being referred to. 

Self-governing cities, also known as autonomous cities, typically have certain recognized parameters such as political autonomy, administrative independence, and the ability to enact local laws. These parameters are often recognized in various international frameworks and by organizations that study urban governance.

However, without the specific criterion being mentioned in the claim, it is difficult to fully verify its accuracy. The statement is somewhat vague and general, which makes it challenging to assess its truthfulness definitively.

Given the general nature of the statement and the fact that self-governing cities do have internationally recognized parameters, but without a specific criterion mentioned, the claim can be considered partially accurate.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Of the 3.5 billion deficits in trade, 2 billion tourism is covered with revenues",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Of the 3.5 billion deficits in trade, 2 billion tourism is covered with revenues,"" we need to break down the statement into its components and verify each part:

1. **Trade Deficit**: The claim states there is a 3.5 billion deficit in trade. This means the country is importing more than it is exporting by 3.5 billion.

2. **Tourism Revenues**: The claim also states that 2 billion of this deficit is covered by tourism revenues. This implies that tourism generates 2 billion in revenue, which helps offset the trade deficit.

To evaluate the truthfulness of this claim, we would need specific data on the trade deficit and tourism revenues for the country in question. Without this data, we can only assess the logical consistency of the statement.

- If the trade deficit is indeed 3.5 billion and tourism revenues are 2 billion, then it is logically consistent to say that tourism revenues cover part of the trade deficit.
- However, the statement does not provide the full picture of the trade balance or other sources of revenue that might also contribute to covering the deficit.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact figures, but assuming the figures are accurate and the logic holds, the claim can be considered:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Roman Gotsiridze: ... Gender Quoting Bill was thrown by the majority two years ago,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of Roman Gotsiridze's claim that the ""Gender Quoting Bill was thrown by the majority two years ago,"" we need to verify the following:

1. Existence of a ""Gender Quoting Bill.""
2. Whether it was indeed proposed and subsequently rejected.
3. The timeline of events, specifically if it happened two years ago.

Without specific details or context, it is challenging to verify the exact claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a real event and the timeline is accurate, we can make an educated guess.

Given the lack of specific information to confirm or refute the claim definitively, the most cautious approach would be to consider it as partially accurate but not fully verifiable.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Balance Balance is improved by $ 700 million,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Balance Balance is improved by $700 million,"" we need to verify the context and the data supporting this statement. This involves checking financial reports, official statements, or other reliable sources that provide information on the balance in question.

Without specific context or data, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified financial data, we can proceed as follows:

1. **True**: If there is clear, verified evidence that the balance has indeed improved by exactly $700 million.
2. **Mostly True**: If the balance has improved by an amount very close to $700 million, with minor discrepancies.
3. **Half True**: If the balance has improved, but the amount is significantly different from $700 million.
4. **Mostly False**: If the balance has improved, but the amount is far from $700 million, or if the improvement is not as significant.
5. **False**: If there is no improvement in the balance, or if the balance has worsened.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the question and the need for a final answer:

Final Answer: Half True",,False,True
"Members of Parliament asked the executive bodies 816 questions in 2012-2016, in 2008-2012 ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the number of questions asked by Members of Parliament to executive bodies during the specified periods (2012-2016 and 2008-2012). The claim states that 816 questions were asked in 2012-2016, but it does not provide a specific number for 2008-2012. Without additional context or data to compare the numbers, it is challenging to fully validate the claim.

Given the lack of specific comparative data for the period 2008-2012, the claim cannot be fully verified or disproven based on the information provided.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The conscripts system in Georgia will be enacted according to the standards of NATO member states,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The conscripts system in Georgia will be enacted according to the standards of NATO member states,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **NATO Standards**: NATO member states do not have a uniform conscription system. Some NATO countries have mandatory conscription (e.g., Norway, Greece), while others have professional volunteer armies (e.g., the United States, the United Kingdom). Therefore, there is no single ""NATO standard"" for conscription.

2. **Georgia's Military Reforms**: Georgia has been working to align its military practices with NATO standards as part of its broader goal of NATO membership. This includes reforms in training, equipment, and operational procedures. However, aligning with NATO standards does not necessarily mean adopting a specific conscription model, as NATO does not prescribe a particular system for conscription.

3. **Official Statements and Policies**: If there are official statements or policies from the Georgian government indicating that their conscription system will be modeled after those of NATO member states, this would lend credibility to the claim. However, without specific details on how Georgia's conscription system will be structured, it is difficult to assess the extent to which it aligns with any NATO member state's practices.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat ambiguous and lacks specificity. While Georgia may be aligning its military practices with NATO standards in general, the statement about the conscription system being enacted according to NATO standards is not entirely accurate due to the lack of a uniform NATO conscription model.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"“The Georgian Public Broadcaster is in the MIA State Security Service, someone ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Georgian Public Broadcaster is in the MIA State Security Service, someone ..."", we need to verify the relationship between the Georgian Public Broadcaster (GPB) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) State Security Service.

The Georgian Public Broadcaster is an independent public service broadcaster in Georgia, established to provide impartial and diverse information to the public. It operates independently of the government and is not part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs or the State Security Service.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) and the State Security Service are separate entities responsible for internal security, law enforcement, and intelligence services in Georgia. They do not have direct control over the Georgian Public Broadcaster.

Given this information, the claim that the Georgian Public Broadcaster is in the MIA State Security Service is incorrect.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The worst demographic indicators in the last 10 years and the economy of the Georgian Dream migration ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the demographic indicators and economic performance of Georgia under the Georgian Dream party over the last 10 years.

1. **Demographic Indicators**: 
   - Georgia has faced challenges with population decline, low birth rates, and high emigration rates. These issues have been persistent over the last decade.
   - However, whether these are the ""worst"" indicators in the last 10 years would require a comparative analysis with previous periods and other countries.

2. **Economy under Georgian Dream**:
   - The Georgian Dream party has been in power since 2012. During this period, Georgia has seen mixed economic performance.
   - There have been periods of economic growth, but also challenges such as unemployment, inflation, and economic impacts from regional instability and global events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. **Migration**:
   - High emigration rates have been a significant issue for Georgia, contributing to demographic challenges. Many Georgians have left the country in search of better economic opportunities abroad.

Given these points, the claim that Georgia has the ""worst demographic indicators in the last 10 years"" and linking it to the ""economy of the Georgian Dream migration"" is somewhat subjective and lacks specific comparative data to definitively label it as the ""worst."" However, it does highlight real and significant issues.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
“I would like to tell you about the return of VAT that this year 70 million [GEL] is more returned last year ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The amount of VAT returned this year.
2. The amount of VAT returned last year.
3. The difference between the two amounts.

If the difference is indeed 70 million GEL more this year compared to last year, then the claim would be 'True'. If the difference is close to 70 million GEL but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the difference is significantly different, the claim could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Without specific data to verify these amounts, I cannot definitively determine the accuracy of the claim. However, based on the structure of the statement and assuming the speaker has accurate data, the claim seems plausible.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Speaking about the pardon of his wife's brother's brother, the president notes that another convict on the same accusation ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify its components:

1. ""Speaking about the pardon of his wife's brother's brother"":
   - This phrase is ambiguous and could be interpreted in multiple ways. It could mean the president's brother-in-law (his wife's brother) or his wife's brother-in-law (his wife's sister's husband). However, without additional context, it's challenging to ascertain the exact relationship.

2. ""the president notes that another convict on the same accusation ..."":
   - This part of the statement suggests that the president is discussing another individual who was convicted of the same crime as the person being pardoned.

Given the ambiguity in the relationship described and the lack of specific details about the pardon and the other convict, it is difficult to verify the claim's accuracy without further context or evidence.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Until 2012, if a person had no appropriate finances, it would have been impossible to use a doctor/hospital ...",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""Until 2012, if a person had no appropriate finances, it would have been impossible to use a doctor/hospital,"" we need to consider the context of healthcare access in the United States before 2012.

1. **Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)**: Since 1986, EMTALA has required hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment to anyone needing it, regardless of their ability to pay. This means that even without appropriate finances, individuals could still access emergency care.

2. **Medicaid and Other Assistance Programs**: Medicaid, established in 1965, provides health coverage to low-income individuals and families. Additionally, various state and local programs have existed to help those without sufficient finances access healthcare services.

3. **Charity Care and Sliding Scale Clinics**: Many hospitals and clinics offer charity care or sliding scale fees based on a patient's ability to pay. These programs have been in place for many years to assist those without adequate financial resources.

Given these points, the claim that it would have been ""impossible"" to use a doctor or hospital without appropriate finances until 2012 is not accurate. While financial barriers certainly existed and limited access to non-emergency care for many, it was not entirely impossible to receive medical treatment.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"Lari's course drop had an objective reason, all of the countries around us suffered from devaluation",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Lari's course drop had an objective reason, all of the countries around us suffered from devaluation,"" we need to consider the context and the specifics of the situation.

1. **Objective Reason**: The claim states that the drop in the value of the Lari (the currency of Georgia) had an objective reason, implying that it was not due to internal factors but rather external ones.

2. **Devaluation in Neighboring Countries**: The claim asserts that all the countries around Georgia experienced devaluation, which could have influenced the Lari's value.

To evaluate this:

- **Economic Context**: If neighboring countries indeed experienced significant devaluation, it could create economic pressure on Georgia, leading to a drop in the Lari's value. This is a common economic phenomenon where regional economic issues can have a ripple effect.

- **Verification**: Historical economic data would need to be checked to confirm if neighboring countries (such as Russia, Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan) experienced devaluation during the same period.

Given that the claim hinges on the economic conditions of neighboring countries and assuming that there is evidence of regional devaluation, the claim can be considered largely accurate. However, without specific data, we cannot fully confirm the extent of the impact.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Suicide facts have increased in the last three years in the penitentiary system,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Suicide facts have increased in the last three years in the penitentiary system,"" we would need to examine reliable data sources such as government reports, research studies, or statistics from credible organizations that track suicide rates in the penitentiary system over the specified period.

Without access to specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information from reliable sources, it could be considered true. Conversely, if there is no supporting data or if the data contradicts the claim, it would be false.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. Therefore, I would need more information to accurately assess the claim.

“The Ministry of Justice has published a list of removed voters with personal numbers.This is the law and the mock ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify whether the Ministry of Justice has indeed published a list of removed voters with personal numbers and whether this action is in accordance with the law.

1. **Verification of Publication**: Check if there is any official announcement or document from the Ministry of Justice that confirms the publication of such a list.
2. **Legal Compliance**: Determine if publishing personal numbers of removed voters is legally permissible. This involves understanding the relevant laws and regulations regarding voter information and privacy.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general practices and privacy laws in many countries, publishing personal numbers of individuals is typically restricted due to privacy concerns.

"According to mobile service rates, Georgia is one of the cheapest countries in the world",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""According to mobile service rates, Georgia is one of the cheapest countries in the world,"" we need to look at recent data and reports on mobile service costs globally.

Several studies and reports, such as those from Cable.co.uk, often analyze and rank countries based on the affordability of mobile data. According to the 2022 report by Cable.co.uk, Georgia was indeed listed among the countries with the lowest mobile data costs. This suggests that the claim has a basis in recent data.

However, the term ""one of the cheapest"" can be somewhat subjective and may depend on the specific metrics used (e.g., cost per GB, overall mobile service costs, etc.). Given that Georgia consistently ranks low in terms of mobile data costs, the claim is largely supported by available data.

"In 2014, Georgia is ranked first in Europe and the region with the growth rate of GDP ... Previously, the leader is inadequate ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In 2014, Georgia is ranked first in Europe and the region with the growth rate of GDP,"" we need to verify the GDP growth rates of European countries and the region for that year.

According to the World Bank data for 2014, Georgia's GDP growth rate was approximately 4.6%. However, other countries in Europe had higher growth rates. For instance, Ireland had a GDP growth rate of around 8.5%, and Malta had a growth rate of about 7.9%. These figures indicate that Georgia was not the highest in Europe in terms of GDP growth rate for 2014.

Given this information, the claim that Georgia was ranked first in Europe and the region with the growth rate of GDP in 2014 is not accurate.

"Local majoritarians of Zugdidi, including Merab Kvaraia, according to NDI research 9 ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The existence of local majoritarians in Zugdidi, including Merab Kvaraia.
2. The involvement of the National Democratic Institute (NDI) in conducting research related to this topic.
3. The specific findings of the NDI research, particularly the number '9' mentioned in the claim.

Without access to the specific NDI research report or additional context, it is challenging to verify the exact details of the claim. However, based on the structure and typical content of such claims, it appears to be a statement that could be verified with the right sources.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided here, I cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Construction of Kobuleti Sports Complex was suspended by the authorities of the Georgian Dream,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Construction of Kobuleti Sports Complex was suspended by the authorities of the Georgian Dream,"" we need to verify the following:

1. Whether the construction of the Kobuleti Sports Complex was indeed suspended.
2. Whether the suspension was carried out by the authorities of the Georgian Dream party.

Without specific and verifiable information from credible sources, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the construction was indeed suspended and that the Georgian Dream party was in power at the time, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific details and assuming the claim is based on accurate information, the most cautious and reasonable categorization would be:

1. **2012 Parliament**: Identify the number of businessmen who were members of the 2012 Parliament.
2. **2016 Parliament**: Identify the number of businessmen who were members of the 2016 Parliament.
3. **Comparison**: Calculate the ratio of the number of businessmen in the 2016 Parliament to the number in the 2012 Parliament.

Without specific data on the number of businessmen in each parliament, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate data, we can analyze the statement logically.

If the number of businessmen in the 2012 Parliament was X, then the number of businessmen in the 2016 Parliament should be between 3X and 4X for the claim to be true.

For example:
- If there were 10 businessmen in the 2012 Parliament, there should be between 30 and 40 businessmen in the 2016 Parliament for the claim to be true.

Given the lack of specific data, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if the claim is based on accurate data, it would be considered 'True'.

"The Georgian Railway was a billion dollar organization in my time and minus $ 200 million, it is a trifle ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim about the Georgian Railway being a billion-dollar organization and the specific financial details mentioned, we need to look at the financial history and valuation of the Georgian Railway.

1. **Georgian Railway Overview**: The Georgian Railway is a state-owned railway company in Georgia, responsible for the operation and management of the country's railway network.

2. **Financial Valuation**: The valuation of a company can fluctuate based on various factors such as revenue, assets, liabilities, and market conditions. There have been periods when the Georgian Railway has been valued at around a billion dollars, especially considering its strategic importance and infrastructure.

3. **Specific Financial Figures**: The claim mentions a specific figure of minus $200 million. Without precise and up-to-date financial statements, it is challenging to verify this exact figure. However, it is not uncommon for large infrastructure companies to have significant debts or financial fluctuations.

Given the general understanding that the Georgian Railway has been a significant and valuable entity, but without precise verification of the exact financial figures mentioned, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not fully verifiable in detail.

1. The actual budget allocated by Rustavi City Hall for the façade renovation of 15 houses.
2. The actual budget allocated for the rehabilitation of one street.
3. The total expenditure combining both projects.
4. Any official statements or documents from Rustavi City Hall confirming these expenditures.

Without access to specific budget documents or official statements from Rustavi City Hall, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the information provided is based on reliable sources or official announcements, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific evidence to either confirm or refute the claim, the most cautious approach would be to consider it as ""Half True,"" indicating that there is some basis to the claim but it may not be fully accurate or complete.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
NATO is not a priority for the Georgian Dream [declared],false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""NATO is not a priority for the Georgian Dream [declared],"" we need to examine the official statements and actions of the Georgian Dream party regarding NATO.

The Georgian Dream party, which has been the ruling party in Georgia since 2012, has generally expressed support for Georgia's Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership. However, there have been instances where the party's commitment to NATO has been questioned, particularly in the context of balancing relations with Russia and addressing domestic political concerns.

For example, in recent years, some members of the Georgian Dream party have made statements that suggest a more cautious approach to NATO integration, emphasizing the need for pragmatic relations with Russia. This has led to some criticism and concerns about the party's dedication to NATO membership.

Given this context, the claim that ""NATO is not a priority for the Georgian Dream [declared]"" is not entirely accurate, as the party has officially maintained support for NATO integration, even if there have been moments of ambiguity or mixed messaging.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
We have equal spending of the budget this year,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have equal spending of the budget this year,"" we need to understand what ""equal spending"" means in this context. If ""equal spending"" refers to the budget being evenly distributed across different categories or departments, we would need to examine the actual budget allocations and expenditures.

Without specific data on how the budget is allocated and spent, it is impossible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that ""equal spending"" means that the budget is evenly distributed and there is no significant disparity in spending across different areas, we can make an educated guess based on typical budget practices.

In most cases, budgets are not evenly distributed across all categories. Certain areas, such as healthcare, education, defense, or infrastructure, often receive more funding than others. Therefore, it is unlikely that the budget is perfectly equal in its spending.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"British views us as wildlife, perceiving us as criminals",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""British views us as wildlife, perceiving us as criminals,"" we need to consider the general attitudes and perceptions of British people towards a specific group. The claim is quite broad and lacks context, making it difficult to assess without additional information.

1. **Generalization**: The statement makes a sweeping generalization about the views of all British people, which is unlikely to be accurate. People's views are diverse and influenced by various factors such as personal experiences, media, education, and social circles.

2. **Context**: The claim does not specify which group is being referred to as ""us."" Without this context, it's challenging to evaluate the statement's validity.

3. **Evidence**: There is no evidence provided to support the claim. Public opinion polls, sociological studies, or other forms of empirical data would be necessary to substantiate such a broad assertion.

4. **Stereotyping**: The claim itself could be seen as perpetuating a stereotype, which is problematic. Stereotypes are often based on limited or biased information and do not reflect the views of an entire population.

Given these points, the claim appears to be an overgeneralization and lacks sufficient context and evidence to be considered accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False

2. The specific time frame referenced (the last 6 months).
3. The exact figure of GEL 247 million and whether it represents a breakthrough or significant change in the budget.
4. Any official sources or reports that confirm or deny this information.

Without access to specific data or official reports, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure and nature of the statement, it appears to be a specific and measurable claim that could be verified with the right data.

Given the lack of specific information and context provided in the claim, it is difficult to assess its accuracy. Therefore, the most appropriate response based on the available information is:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"“The regulations, neither by law nor any internal normative acts are defined by the main auditor ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the statement: ""The regulations, neither by law nor any internal normative acts are defined by the main auditor.""

1. **Regulations by Law**: Regulations are typically defined and enforced by legislative bodies or regulatory agencies, not by individual auditors. Auditors follow these regulations to ensure compliance.

2. **Internal Normative Acts**: Internal normative acts, such as company policies or internal guidelines, are usually established by the organization's management or governing bodies, not by the main auditor. The auditor's role is to ensure these internal acts are being followed.

Given this context, the claim that regulations are not defined by the main auditor, either by law or internal normative acts, aligns with the general understanding of the roles and responsibilities of auditors.

"Over the years, the number of social assistance recipients is increasing before the election and then again ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Over the years, the number of social assistance recipients is increasing before the election and then again ..."", we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Data**: We would need to examine historical data on social assistance recipients over multiple election cycles to identify any patterns of increase before elections.
2. **Political Influence**: It is important to consider whether there is evidence that political parties or governments have a history of increasing social assistance before elections to gain favor with voters.
3. **Economic Factors**: Economic conditions, such as recessions or unemployment rates, can also influence the number of social assistance recipients, independent of election cycles.
4. **Policy Changes**: Changes in social assistance policies or eligibility criteria can affect the number of recipients and may coincide with election periods.

Without specific data or evidence to support the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if there is some anecdotal or partial evidence suggesting that social assistance increases before elections, but not enough to fully substantiate the claim, it might be considered ""Half True.""

The claim suggests a comparison between the destruction of 150 archaeological sites and the preservation of Sakdrisi.

1. **BP Project and Archaeological Sites**: There is no widely known BP project that is associated with the destruction of 150 archaeological sites. BP (British Petroleum) is primarily involved in energy projects, and while there have been environmental concerns related to their activities, there is no specific record of such a large number of archaeological sites being destroyed.

2. **Sakdrisi**: Sakdrisi is an ancient gold mine in Georgia, which has been a subject of controversy. There were significant protests and international outcry when the site was threatened by mining activities. However, it is not accurate to say that Sakdrisi was preserved without any damage, as there were reports of destruction despite the protests.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim that 150 archaeological sites were destroyed during a BP project and the fact that Sakdrisi did experience some level of destruction, the claim appears to be misleading.

Exports to the EU during this period increased 70%,"" we need to verify the data from reliable sources such as trade statistics from the Georgian government, international trade organizations, or reputable economic research institutions.

1. **Overall Exports Increase**: Check if the total exports from Georgia have indeed increased by 24% over the specified two-year period.
2. **Exports to the EU**: Verify if exports specifically to the European Union have increased by 70% during the same timeframe.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and comes from a reliable source, we can evaluate the claim based on the information given.

Given the structure of the claim, it is possible for the overall exports to increase by a smaller percentage (24%) while exports to a specific region (EU) increase by a larger percentage (70%), as the latter is a subset of the former.

**Assuming the data is accurate and from a reliable source:**

"According to a Heritage Foundation survey, Georgia's European Court's Effectiveness ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""According to a Heritage Foundation survey, Georgia's European Court's Effectiveness ..."", we need to verify several aspects:

1. **Existence of the Survey**: Check if the Heritage Foundation has conducted a survey related to Georgia's European Court's effectiveness.
2. **Content of the Survey**: Verify if the survey specifically addresses the effectiveness of Georgia's European Court.
3. **Relevance and Accuracy**: Ensure that the claim accurately represents the findings of the survey.

The Heritage Foundation is a conservative think tank based in the United States, and it is not typically known for conducting surveys on European courts. Additionally, Georgia is a country in the Caucasus region, and it does not have a ""European Court"" per se; it may be subject to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) as a member of the Council of Europe.

Given these points, it seems unlikely that the Heritage Foundation would conduct a survey specifically on the effectiveness of Georgia's European Court. Therefore, without concrete evidence supporting the existence and content of such a survey, the claim appears to be inaccurate.

"""We have been intensifying this dialogue [on free trade with the United States"" """,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have been intensifying this dialogue [on free trade with the United States],"" we need to consider the context and recent developments in trade discussions between the relevant parties. 

1. **Context**: Identify the parties involved in the dialogue. This could be a country, a trade organization, or a specific group of negotiators.
2. **Recent Developments**: Look at recent news, official statements, and trade negotiation activities to see if there has been an increase in discussions or actions related to free trade with the United States.
3. **Sources**: Verify the information from credible sources such as government announcements, trade reports, and reputable news outlets.

Without specific details on the parties involved and the timeframe, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if there have been recent reports or official statements indicating an increase in trade discussions with the United States, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim provided, but assuming there have been some recent developments in trade talks, a cautious assessment might be:

2. The context or comparison involving the land nearby from ten years ago.

Without additional context or verification of these specific details, it is not possible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the structure of the statement, it appears to be presenting a factual assertion about a recent purchase and a historical comparison.

Given the lack of specific evidence to confirm or refute the details provided, the most appropriate classification would be:

"In all countries, the National Bank has been fortified by the currency… we should not have such actions ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""In all countries, the National Bank has been fortified by the currency.""
2. ""We should not have such actions.""

For the first part, the statement ""In all countries, the National Bank has been fortified by the currency"" is not universally true. National banks in different countries have varying structures, roles, and sources of fortification. While many national banks do play a significant role in managing and stabilizing the national currency, this is not a universal truth applicable to all countries. Some countries may have different financial systems or mechanisms in place.

For the second part, ""We should not have such actions,"" it is a subjective statement and depends on the context of what actions are being referred to. Without additional context, it is difficult to evaluate the truthfulness of this part.

Given the generalization in the first part and the lack of context in the second part, the overall claim cannot be considered fully accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
No large -scale infrastructure projects have been implemented in Samtredia since 2012,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""No large-scale infrastructure projects have been implemented in Samtredia since 2012,"" we would need to verify the presence or absence of such projects in Samtredia from 2012 onwards. This would involve checking records, news reports, government announcements, and other reliable sources for any large-scale infrastructure developments in the area.

Without specific data or sources to confirm or refute the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that no significant projects have been reported or documented in reliable sources, we might lean towards the claim being true. Conversely, if there are documented projects, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific information provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I will refrain from making an assumption and instead state that more information is needed.

"“Economic growth in Georgia is the highest, this is the World Bank's information.If we don't ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Economic growth in Georgia is the highest, this is the World Bank's information,"" we need to verify the latest data from the World Bank regarding economic growth rates.

1. **Check World Bank Data**: The World Bank regularly publishes data on the economic growth rates of countries. This data is typically available on their official website or through their annual reports.

2. **Compare Growth Rates**: We need to compare Georgia's economic growth rate with that of other countries to see if it is indeed the highest.

3. **Context and Time Frame**: The claim does not specify a time frame (e.g., quarterly, annually) or whether it refers to a specific region or globally. This context is crucial for accurate verification.

Without the specific data at hand, we can make a general assessment based on typical economic reports and trends. As of the latest available data, Georgia has shown significant economic growth, but it is unlikely to be the highest in the world, as other countries often report higher growth rates.

**Verification Steps**:
- **World Bank Data**: According to the World Bank's latest data, Georgia's economic growth rate is notable but not the highest globally.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Countries like China, India, and some African nations often report higher growth rates.

Based on this information, the claim that ""Economic growth in Georgia is the highest, this is the World Bank's information"" is not fully accurate.

"For the second year, the Georgian Dream government has not been able to handle school textbooks",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""For the second year, the Georgian Dream government has not been able to handle school textbooks,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Context and Background**: The Georgian Dream is a political party in Georgia that has been in power since 2012. The claim suggests a specific issue with school textbooks over a two-year period.

2. **Evidence and Sources**: We would need to look at reports, news articles, and official statements from the Georgian government or educational authorities to verify if there have been ongoing issues with school textbooks for two consecutive years.

3. **Nature of the Issue**: The term ""handle"" is somewhat vague. It could refer to various problems such as distribution delays, quality issues, content controversies, or logistical challenges.

Without specific evidence or detailed information, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if there are credible reports or consistent issues documented over two years, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I would lean towards a cautious assessment.

We are the only country in the world whose legislation is the case of a person's court decision ...,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are the only country in the world whose legislation is the case of a person's court decision,"" we need to analyze the statement in the context of how legal systems operate globally.

1. **Legislation vs. Court Decisions**: Legislation typically refers to laws enacted by a legislative body, such as a parliament or congress. Court decisions, on the other hand, are rulings made by judges in the judicial system. In many countries, court decisions can interpret and apply legislation, but they do not constitute legislation themselves.

2. **Common Law vs. Civil Law Systems**: In common law countries (e.g., the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada), court decisions (case law) play a significant role in shaping the law. However, even in these countries, legislation is created by legislative bodies, not by court decisions alone. In civil law countries (e.g., France, Germany, Japan), legislation is primarily codified and less reliant on judicial decisions.

3. **Unique Legal Systems**: No country is known to have a legal system where legislation is solely based on individual court decisions without any legislative process. Court decisions can influence and interpret laws, but they do not replace the legislative process.

Given this context, the claim that any country’s legislation is solely the result of a person's court decision is inaccurate.

1. The actual expenditure of the Ministry of Agriculture of Adjara over the specified five-year period.
2. Whether the amount spent aligns with the ""about 100 million"" figure mentioned in the claim.

Without specific data or sources to confirm the exact expenditure, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on available data and there is no significant evidence to the contrary, we might consider it to be reasonably accurate.

Given the lack of specific data to either fully confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
We have the highest economic growth in the region,mostly false,ka,"To accurately determine whether the claim ""We have the highest economic growth in the region"" is true, we would need specific data on the economic growth rates of all countries or entities within the specified region. This data would typically come from reliable sources such as government reports, international organizations (e.g., the World Bank, International Monetary Fund), or reputable economic research institutions.

Without access to this specific data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a credible source and there is no evidence to the contrary, we might lean towards a certain level of truthfulness. Conversely, if there is evidence that other countries in the region have higher economic growth rates, the claim would be less accurate.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if you provide more context or data, I could give a more precise evaluation.

“Georgia is the only state in Eastern Europe with integrated border management ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgia is the only state in Eastern Europe with integrated border management,"" we need to consider the context and definitions involved.

1. **Integrated Border Management (IBM)**: This is a comprehensive approach to border management that involves coordination and cooperation among various agencies and stakeholders to ensure secure and efficient border control.

2. **Eastern Europe**: This term can be somewhat ambiguous, but it generally includes countries like Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, among others.

3. **Georgia's IBM Status**: Georgia has indeed made significant strides in implementing integrated border management, often with support from the European Union and other international bodies. The country has been recognized for its efforts in this area.

4. **Other Countries**: Several other Eastern European countries have also adopted integrated border management practices, often with support from the EU and other international organizations. For example, countries like Ukraine and Moldova have also been working on integrated border management systems.

Given this information, the claim that Georgia is the ""only"" state in Eastern Europe with integrated border management is an overstatement. While Georgia may be a leader or a notable example, it is not the only country in the region to have implemented such systems.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and reflects the actual change in the current account deficit, the claim would be 'True'. If the data is not accurate or misrepresented, the claim could be 'False' or fall somewhere in between.

2. **Context and Details**: Understand the context in which the resources were provided. Are these resources in the form of loans, grants, subsidies, or another type of financial support? The nature of the support can affect the interpretation of the claim.

3. **Time Frame**: Determine the time frame during which these resources were provided. Was it a one-time allocation, or spread over several years?

Without access to the specific financial records or reports of Parkingervice, it is challenging to verify these details definitively. However, based on the structure of the claim, it appears to be a straightforward comparison of expected versus actual revenue.

Given the information provided:
- The claim states that Parkingervice brought in 166 thousand GEL instead of the expected 460 thousand GEL.
- The claim also mentions that 60% of the revenue is related to some context not fully provided.

"With tightened tax administration, revenues from the gambling business in recent years have increased ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""With tightened tax administration, revenues from the gambling business in recent years have increased,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Tax Administration**: Tightened tax administration typically involves stricter enforcement of tax laws, better compliance mechanisms, and possibly higher tax rates or new taxes on gambling activities.

2. **Revenue Trends**: We need to look at data on gambling revenues over recent years to see if there has been an increase. This data can come from government reports, industry analyses, or financial statements from gambling businesses.

3. **Causation**: Even if there is an increase in revenues, we need to establish that the increase is due to tightened tax administration and not other factors such as increased popularity of gambling, economic conditions, or expansion of gambling services.

Without specific data and analysis, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, it is reasonable to infer that stricter tax administration could lead to higher reported revenues due to better compliance and reduced tax evasion.

Given these considerations, the claim seems plausible but not definitively proven without specific data.

1. **Small Government**: This generally refers to a government with limited intervention in the economy and fewer public sector employees relative to the size of the economy.

2. **Indicator of Salaries with GDP**: This suggests that the size of the government can be measured by the proportion of government salaries relative to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

3. **Planned in 2019**: This implies that there was a specific plan or projection made in 2019 regarding the relationship between government size and salaries with GDP.

### Analysis:

- **Small Government and Salaries with GDP**: It is true that one way to measure the size of the government is by looking at government spending, including salaries, as a percentage of GDP. A smaller government would typically have a lower percentage of GDP allocated to government salaries.

- **Planned in 2019**: Without specific context or data from 2019, it is difficult to verify if there was a particular plan or projection made in that year regarding this relationship. However, it is plausible that such plans or projections could have been made.

Given the general understanding of the terms and the plausible nature of the claim, but without specific evidence from 2019, the claim can be considered somewhat accurate but not fully verifiable.

"[The President of the National Bank] has exchanged GEL 70%, and no neighboring country has no such depreciation ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement into its components and verify each part:

1. ""The President of the National Bank has exchanged GEL 70%"":
   - This part of the statement is unclear. It could mean that the President of the National Bank has devalued the Georgian Lari (GEL) by 70%, or it could mean that 70% of the GEL has been exchanged for another currency. We need specific data on the exchange rate changes or actions taken by the President of the National Bank to verify this.

2. ""No neighboring country has no such depreciation"":
   - This part of the statement implies that none of Georgia's neighboring countries have experienced a similar level of currency depreciation. To verify this, we need to look at the recent currency depreciation rates of countries neighboring Georgia (e.g., Russia, Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan).

Without specific data on the exchange rate changes and the currency depreciation rates of neighboring countries, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure and typical economic scenarios, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the ambiguity and the need for specific data, the claim appears to be exaggerated or misleading.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
"At the water supply company, Tsabutashvili's management paid GEL 80,000 for the program, which is ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""At the water supply company, Tsabutashvili's management paid GEL 80,000 for the program,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. Whether Tsabutashvili's management is indeed associated with the water supply company in question.
2. Whether a payment of GEL 80,000 was made by this management.
3. Whether the payment was specifically for a program.

Without additional context or evidence to confirm these details, it is not possible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we assume that the information provided is accurate and there are no discrepancies, the claim could be considered 'True'. Conversely, if any part of the information is incorrect or misleading, the claim could range from 'Mostly True' to 'False'.

Given the lack of specific evidence or context provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I must refrain from making a conclusive judgment.

Final Answer: Not enough information to determine.",,False,True
"“To date, there was virtually no mechanism for identifying illegal and ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""To date, there was virtually no mechanism for identifying illegal and ..."", we need to consider the context and the specific mechanisms being referred to. 

If the claim is about a specific area, such as illegal immigration, illegal financial transactions, or illegal online content, the accuracy can vary. For instance:

1. **Illegal Immigration**: There are mechanisms in place, such as border patrols, visa checks, and immigration enforcement agencies.
2. **Illegal Financial Transactions**: Financial institutions and governments have systems like anti-money laundering (AML) protocols and financial monitoring systems.
3. **Illegal Online Content**: There are mechanisms like content moderation, digital forensics, and cybersecurity measures.

Given that there are established mechanisms in various fields to identify illegal activities, the claim that there was ""virtually no mechanism"" is likely an exaggeration.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"“The 8 -month budget is executed and there is an exaggeration.The budget of 9, 10, 11 and 12 months will also be executed. ”",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The 8-month budget is executed and there is an exaggeration.""
2. ""The budget of 9, 10, 11, and 12 months will also be executed.""

For the first part, ""The 8-month budget is executed and there is an exaggeration,"" we need to verify if the budget for the first 8 months has indeed been executed and if there is any evidence of exaggeration. Without specific data or context, it's challenging to confirm or deny this statement.

For the second part, ""The budget of 9, 10, 11, and 12 months will also be executed,"" this is a prediction about future events. While it is possible that the remaining budget will be executed, it is not certain and depends on various factors such as government decisions, economic conditions, and unforeseen circumstances.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support or refute both parts of the claim, the most appropriate classification would be 'Half True' as it contains elements that could be true but are not fully verifiable with the given information.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"The Georgian Dream has increased the number of public servants by 14,000",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Georgian Dream has increased the number of public servants by 14,000,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Identify where this claim originated. Is it from a reliable source such as a government report, a reputable news outlet, or an official statement from the Georgian Dream party?

2. **Data Verification**: Check official statistics or reports from the Georgian government or relevant agencies that track public sector employment numbers. This could include annual reports, budget documents, or employment records.

3. **Time Frame**: Determine the time frame during which this increase supposedly occurred. The Georgian Dream has been in power since 2012, so the claim should be contextualized within this period.

4. **Contextual Factors**: Consider any external factors that might have influenced public sector employment, such as economic conditions, policy changes, or administrative reforms.

Without access to specific data or sources, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable data from reliable sources, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the need for precise data to confirm the exact number, and assuming that the claim is based on some level of factual information but may not be entirely accurate or complete, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Predicting supplements in state agencies contradict the requirement of the applicable law,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Predicting supplements in state agencies contradict the requirement of the applicable law,"" we need to analyze the statement in the context of legal requirements and the role of state agencies.

1. **Predicting Supplements**: This phrase is somewhat ambiguous. If it refers to forecasting or estimating the need for additional resources or supplements, it is a common practice in many state agencies to ensure they meet their operational requirements.

2. **Contradict the Requirement of the Applicable Law**: This part of the statement suggests that there is a legal requirement that would be violated by predicting supplements. However, without specific details about the law in question, it is difficult to assert that such predictions inherently contradict legal requirements.

In general, state agencies often engage in planning and forecasting to ensure they can fulfill their mandates effectively. This planning process typically includes predicting the need for additional resources or supplements. Unless there is a specific law that explicitly prohibits such predictions, the claim seems unfounded.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The current account deficit in 2018 was 7.7% of GDP and decreased compared to the previous year.This p ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific data regarding the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP for the year 2018 and compare it to the previous year, 2017.

1. **Current Account Deficit in 2018**: The claim states it was 7.7% of GDP.
2. **Comparison to Previous Year (2017)**: The claim states it decreased compared to 2017.

Let's verify these points with available data:

- According to the World Bank and other reliable economic sources, the current account deficit for a country can be found in their economic reports.
- If the current account deficit in 2017 was higher than 7.7%, then the claim that it decreased in 2018 would be accurate.

For example, if the current account deficit in 2017 was 8.0% of GDP and it decreased to 7.7% in 2018, the claim would be true.

Without specific data at hand, we can make a general assessment based on the provided information. If the data aligns with the claim, it would be 'True'. If there is a slight discrepancy, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the data is significantly different, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Given the claim as it stands and assuming the data is accurate:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"“One area we have to do is construction, but I will tell you that I have 40%in construction ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and the specific details provided. The statement mentions having ""40% in construction,"" but it is unclear what this percentage refers to. It could mean 40% of a workforce, budget, project completion, or something else related to construction.

Without additional context or specific information to verify what the 40% pertains to, it is challenging to assess the truthfulness of the claim accurately. Therefore, based on the information provided:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
“In all evaluations (in the last 6-8 years) the Public Broadcaster was named as in ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the evaluations of the Public Broadcaster over the last 6-8 years. This would involve checking multiple sources and reports to see if the Public Broadcaster was consistently named in the manner described.

Without specific data or sources to confirm this claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that the claim is being made without any supporting evidence provided, we might lean towards a more cautious assessment.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"We have a heavy social background, about 38% of the city budget is spent on social programs",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""about 38% of the city budget is spent on social programs,"" we would need to verify the actual budget allocation of the city in question. This involves checking the city's official budget documents or reliable sources that provide a breakdown of the budget.

If the available data confirms that approximately 38% of the city budget is indeed allocated to social programs, then the claim would be 'True'. If the percentage is close but not exactly 38%, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the percentage is significantly different, the claim could range from 'Half True' to 'False' depending on the degree of discrepancy.

Without specific data to verify the claim, we cannot definitively categorize it. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and verified information, we can tentatively categorize it as follows:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
NATO European Analog: A rift between the Western countries has emerged,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""NATO European Analog: A rift between the Western countries has emerged,"" we need to consider the current state of relations among NATO member countries, particularly those in Europe.

1. **NATO's Unity and Challenges**: NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a military alliance of Western countries, primarily in Europe and North America. While NATO has generally maintained a strong sense of unity, there have been instances of disagreements and differing priorities among member states. These disagreements can be related to defense spending, strategic priorities, and responses to global threats.

2. **Recent Developments**: In recent years, there have been notable tensions within NATO. For example, disagreements over defense spending commitments, the approach to Russia, and the handling of security threats have occasionally caused friction. However, these disagreements have not fundamentally undermined the alliance's overall cohesion.

3. **European Union (EU) Dynamics**: Within the European Union, which overlaps significantly with NATO membership, there have also been political and economic disagreements. Issues such as Brexit, migration policies, and economic strategies have sometimes created rifts among EU member states.

4. **Current Context**: As of the latest information available, while there are ongoing discussions and occasional disagreements among Western countries within NATO and the EU, these do not constitute a fundamental or irreparable rift. The alliance continues to function and collaborate on key security issues.

Given this context, the claim that ""a rift between the Western countries has emerged"" is somewhat exaggerated. While there are disagreements and challenges, they do not amount to a significant rift that threatens the overall unity of NATO or the Western alliance.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"There is a precedent for ""Hriko Slovakia"" when to protect the court with impartiality ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down and verify each part:

1. **""Hriko Slovakia""**: There is no widely known or documented precedent or legal case specifically named ""Hriko Slovakia"" in international law or Slovakian legal history. This part of the claim appears to be either incorrect or fictional.

2. **""to protect the court with impartiality""**: Courts are generally expected to operate with impartiality as a fundamental principle of justice. However, without a specific context or case, this statement is too vague to verify in relation to ""Hriko Slovakia.""

Given the lack of evidence or documentation supporting the existence of ""Hriko Slovakia"" as a precedent, the claim appears to be unfounded.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"APR 9, 2015 - Aqui No Brasil, O Sindicato Dos Jornalistas Do Paraná Denunciou ...... a maioria dessas investigações é ligada a reportagens do jornal gazeta do povo, de 2012. ... para a gente é é um constrangimento, um constrangimento muito ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and details provided in the statement. The claim mentions that on April 9, 2015, the Sindicato dos Jornalistas do Paraná (Journalists' Union of Paraná) denounced something related to investigations tied to reports from the newspaper Gazeta do Povo from 2012, and that this situation is described as a ""constrangimento"" (embarrassment or constraint).

Given the information provided, it is difficult to verify the exact details without additional context or sources. However, the claim does provide specific details such as the date, the organization involved, and the connection to the Gazeta do Povo's 2012 reports. 

Based on the information available and assuming no additional context or sources to contradict the claim, it appears to be a specific and plausible statement.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"“In 2012 it was impossible to request any public information from the Audit Office, long ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In 2012 it was impossible to request any public information from the Audit Office,"" we need to consider the context and the availability of public information from the Audit Office during that time.

1. **Freedom of Information Laws**: Many countries have Freedom of Information (FOI) laws that allow the public to request information from government bodies, including audit offices. If the country in question had such laws in place in 2012, it would generally be possible to request public information, although there might be exceptions or limitations.

2. **Audit Office Policies**: The specific policies of the Audit Office in 2012 would also be relevant. Some audit offices may have had restrictive policies or practices that made it difficult to obtain information, even if FOI laws existed.

3. **Historical Context**: If there were specific events or circumstances in 2012 that led to a temporary suspension or significant restriction of public information requests from the Audit Office, this would be important to know.

Without specific details about the country or the exact circumstances, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, given that many countries had FOI laws by 2012, it is unlikely that it was entirely impossible to request any public information from the Audit Office.

"Kutaisi has recovered two million GEL from municipal transport each year, which is in the pocket of the males ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Kutaisi has recovered two million GEL from municipal transport each year, which is in the pocket of the males,"" we need to evaluate two main components:

1. **Financial Recovery**: Whether Kutaisi has indeed recovered two million GEL from municipal transport each year.
2. **Beneficiaries**: Whether this amount is specifically going into the pockets of males.

Without specific data or evidence to support these claims, it is challenging to verify their accuracy. However, based on the structure and typical scrutiny of such claims, we can make an educated assessment.

1. **Financial Recovery**: Municipal transport systems often generate revenue, but the exact figure of two million GEL would need to be verified through municipal financial records or official statements.
2. **Beneficiaries**: The claim that the recovered money is specifically going into the pockets of males is a significant assertion that would require evidence of gender-specific financial distribution, which is uncommon in public financial management.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided for both components, the claim appears to be speculative and lacks substantiation.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
"With the 2018 budget project, the current expenses of the government are reduced by 1.5%",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""With the 2018 budget project, the current expenses of the government are reduced by 1.5%,"" we need to verify the actual data from the 2018 budget.

1. **Check Official Sources**: Look at official government documents, such as the budget report for 2018, to see if there is a stated reduction in current expenses by 1.5%.

2. **Contextual Analysis**: Understand what is meant by ""current expenses"" and whether the 1.5% reduction applies to the entire budget or specific sectors.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Review analyses or reports from credible financial experts or institutions that have evaluated the 2018 budget.

Without access to these specific details, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a general understanding of the budget and there is no contradictory evidence, we might lean towards a cautious assessment.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, the most prudent response would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Today is our economy growth forecast 4.6%, which is the highest growth in the whole region",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Today is our economy growth forecast 4.6%, which is the highest growth in the whole region,"" we need to verify two key points:

1. The accuracy of the 4.6% economic growth forecast.
2. Whether this 4.6% growth rate is indeed the highest in the entire region.

Without specific data on the current economic growth forecasts for the region in question, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on recent and accurate data, we can make an educated guess.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate response would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not informed about the president's visit to the US,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not informed about the president's visit to the US,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. **Official Statements**: Check if there are any official statements from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the President's office confirming or denying the claim.
2. **News Reports**: Look for credible news reports that provide information on whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was informed about the visit.
3. **Historical Context**: Consider if there have been previous instances where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not informed about similar visits, which might provide context.

Without access to specific and verifiable information, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a reliable source or official statement, we can make an educated guess.

"“Under your government, the country has lost a billion and a half.These were 700 million specific receipts in the budget and half a billion dollars of foreign exchange reserve to stabilize the GEL exchange rate. """,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. Whether the country has indeed lost a billion and a half in total.
2. Whether there were 700 million specific receipts lost in the budget.
3. Whether half a billion dollars of foreign exchange reserves were used to stabilize the GEL exchange rate.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these figures, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the figures are accurate and based on reliable data, the claim could be considered accurate. If any of the figures are exaggerated or incorrect, the claim would be less accurate.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact figures, the most cautious approach would be to categorize the claim as 'Half True', indicating that it may contain some elements of truth but lacks full verification.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"In 2016 we had 23 million regional projects in Kakheti, increased in 2017, in 2018 - 35 ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific numbers of regional projects in Kakheti for the years 2016, 2017, and 2018. The claim states that there were 23 million regional projects in 2016, an increase in 2017, and 35 million in 2018.

Without access to specific data or sources that confirm these numbers, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, the phrasing ""23 million regional projects"" and ""35 million"" seems unusual, as it is more common to refer to the number of projects rather than their monetary value in millions. This discrepancy raises doubts about the accuracy of the claim.

Given the lack of specific data and the unusual phrasing, the claim cannot be fully verified.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Anti -dumping legislation is in force in Georgia,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Anti-dumping legislation is in force in Georgia,"" we need to verify if Georgia has enacted and enforces laws specifically aimed at preventing dumping practices. Dumping refers to the practice of exporting goods at a price lower than the market value in the importing country, which can harm domestic industries.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, Georgia, the country, has been working on aligning its trade policies with international standards, including those of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Georgia has been a member of the WTO since 2000, and WTO membership typically requires adherence to certain trade regulations, including anti-dumping measures.

However, specific details about the current status of anti-dumping legislation in Georgia would require up-to-date verification from reliable sources such as government publications, legal databases, or recent trade policy reviews.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"According to international assessments, we even have challenges in literacy today, Pisa's estimates ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and data from international assessments like the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). PISA is a worldwide study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that evaluates educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading.

PISA results have shown that many countries, including some with advanced education systems, face challenges in literacy. These challenges can vary in severity and scope, but the data often highlight areas where improvements are needed.

Given that PISA assessments do indicate literacy challenges in various countries, the claim that ""we even have challenges in literacy today, Pisa's estimates ..."" is supported by the data.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
Developments in Greece will definitely have an impact on Georgia,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Developments in Greece will definitely have an impact on Georgia,"" we need to consider the nature of the relationship between Greece and Georgia, including economic, political, and social factors.

1. **Economic Ties**: Greece and Georgia have some level of economic interaction, but it is not particularly strong. Greece is part of the European Union, and its economic policies and crises can have ripple effects on the broader European economy, which might indirectly affect Georgia. However, Georgia's economy is more closely tied to its immediate neighbors and major global economies.

2. **Political Relations**: Both countries are part of various international organizations, but they do not have a particularly strong bilateral political relationship. Developments in Greece, such as changes in government or policy, are unlikely to have a direct and significant impact on Georgia's political landscape.

3. **Geopolitical Context**: Greece is located in Southern Europe, while Georgia is in the Caucasus region. They do not share a border, and their geopolitical concerns are quite different. Greece's primary geopolitical issues involve the EU, Turkey, and the Eastern Mediterranean, whereas Georgia's concerns are more focused on Russia and regional stability in the Caucasus.

Given these points, while there may be some indirect effects of developments in Greece on Georgia, the claim that these developments will ""definitely"" have an impact on Georgia is an overstatement.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"""The number of stateless students who could not pay for money are reduced on the contrary""",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down and analyze its components:

1. ""The number of stateless students who could not pay for money are reduced on the contrary.""

- ""Stateless students"" refers to students who do not have citizenship in any country.
- ""Could not pay for money"" is a confusing phrase. It likely means students who could not afford to pay for their education or related expenses.
- ""Are reduced on the contrary"" suggests a decrease in the number of such students, but the phrase ""on the contrary"" implies an opposite situation, which adds confusion.

Given the unclear and contradictory nature of the statement, it is difficult to ascertain its truthfulness without additional context or clarification. The phrase ""on the contrary"" seems to contradict the idea of a reduction, making the claim internally inconsistent.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"In the past three years, state debt has increased over 3 billion",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In the past three years, state debt has increased over 3 billion,"" we need to verify the actual data on state debt over the specified period. This involves checking reliable sources such as government financial reports, budget documents, or reputable financial news outlets.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to verify it:

1. **Check Government Financial Reports**: Look at the official financial statements or budget reports from the state government for the past three years. These documents typically provide detailed information on state debt levels.

2. **Consult Reputable Financial News Sources**: Financial news outlets often report on changes in state debt and can provide context and analysis.

3. **State Treasury or Comptroller's Office**: These offices usually publish annual reports that include information on state debt.

If you have access to these sources and can confirm that the state debt has indeed increased by over 3 billion in the past three years, then the claim would be 'True'. If the increase is close but not exactly 3 billion, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the increase is significantly less, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on the discrepancy.

Final Answer: Without specific data, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. Please verify with the appropriate sources.",,False,True
"Last months, budget deficit spending has not affected the amount of money in circulation ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Last months, budget deficit spending has not affected the amount of money in circulation,"" we need to understand the relationship between budget deficit spending and the money supply.

Budget deficit spending occurs when a government spends more money than it receives in revenue. This deficit is typically financed by borrowing, which can involve the government issuing bonds. The impact of this borrowing on the money supply depends on how the deficit is financed and the actions of the central bank.

1. **If the central bank purchases government bonds**: This can increase the money supply because the central bank is effectively creating new money to buy the bonds.
2. **If private investors purchase government bonds**: This might not immediately increase the money supply, as it involves a transfer of existing money from investors to the government.
3. **If the government borrows from foreign entities**: This can also have varying effects on the domestic money supply, depending on the specifics of the transactions.

Given these scenarios, it is generally expected that budget deficit spending can affect the money supply, especially if the central bank is involved in financing the deficit by purchasing government bonds.

Therefore, the claim that ""Last months, budget deficit spending has not affected the amount of money in circulation"" is likely to be inaccurate because deficit spending typically has some impact on the money supply.

"The Law on Prosecutor's Office is an imitation of depoliticisms of this body, which is still the system of ruling Paul ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and analyze its components:

1. **""The Law on Prosecutor's Office is an imitation of depoliticisms of this body""**: This part suggests that the law is pretending or attempting to show that it is removing political influence from the Prosecutor's Office.

2. **""which is still the system of ruling Paul ...""**: This part implies that despite the law's claims, the Prosecutor's Office remains under the control or influence of a ruling entity or individual named Paul.

To evaluate this, we would need specific information about the law in question, the political context, and the influence of the individual or entity named Paul. Without concrete evidence or detailed context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

However, based on the structure of the statement, it appears to be a critical opinion suggesting that the law is not genuinely effective in depoliticizing the Prosecutor's Office and that political control persists.

Given the lack of specific evidence and context, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"During my presidency, in addition to 2008, more people were returning to Georgia than they were going",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""During my presidency, in addition to 2008, more people were returning to Georgia than they were going,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Time Frame**: The claim refers to a specific presidency, but it does not specify which president or the exact years of the presidency. For the sake of analysis, let's assume it refers to a recent president of Georgia, such as Mikheil Saakashvili (2004-2013) or Giorgi Margvelashvili (2013-2018).

2. **Migration Data**: We need to look at migration statistics for Georgia during the specified presidency. This includes data on the number of people emigrating from and immigrating to Georgia.

3. **2008 Context**: The year 2008 is significant due to the Russo-Georgian War, which likely affected migration patterns.

### Analysis:

- **Mikheil Saakashvili's Presidency (2004-2013)**: During Saakashvili's presidency, Georgia experienced significant political and economic changes. The 2008 war with Russia led to displacement and emigration. However, post-war recovery efforts and economic reforms may have encouraged some return migration.

- **Giorgi Margvelashvili's Presidency (2013-2018)**: During Margvelashvili's term, Georgia continued to stabilize and develop economically, which could have influenced migration patterns positively.

### Data Review:

- **Emigration and Immigration Trends**: According to various reports and data from the National Statistics Office of Georgia, there were fluctuations in migration patterns. For instance, in some years, more people emigrated than immigrated, while in other years, the opposite was true.

- **2008 Specifics**: The 2008 war caused a spike in emigration due to conflict, but subsequent years saw efforts to rebuild and stabilize, potentially leading to return migration.

### Conclusion:

Given the complexity of migration patterns and the impact of the 2008 war, the claim that ""more people were returning to Georgia than they were going"" during the presidency in question (excluding 2008) is partially supported by data but not conclusively proven for all years.

"Spend so much money on agriculture and agriculture has not increased, and its economy is ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Spend so much money on agriculture and agriculture has not increased, and its economy is ..."", we need to consider several factors:

1. **Investment in Agriculture**: Whether significant funds have indeed been allocated to agriculture.
2. **Agricultural Output**: Whether there has been an increase or stagnation in agricultural productivity.
3. **Economic Impact**: The broader economic context and how agriculture's performance affects the overall economy.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a situation where substantial investments have been made in agriculture but there has been no corresponding increase in agricultural output or economic improvement, the claim could be evaluated as follows:

- **True**: If there is clear evidence that despite significant spending, agricultural productivity has not increased and the economy has not benefited.
- **Mostly True**: If the majority of the evidence supports the claim, but there are minor exceptions or nuances.
- **Half True**: If the evidence is mixed, with some indicators supporting the claim and others contradicting it.
- **Mostly False**: If the majority of the evidence contradicts the claim, but there are minor elements of truth.
- **False**: If there is clear evidence that contradicts the claim entirely.

Given the lack of specific data in the provided statement, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Drug possessions are decriminalized only in the two countries of Europe and the situation has worsened both,half true,ka,"Final Answer: False

Explanation: Drug possession has been decriminalized in more than two European countries, including Portugal, the Czech Republic, and others. Additionally, the claim that the situation has worsened in both countries is not universally supported by evidence. For example, Portugal's decriminalization of drug possession has been associated with positive outcomes such as reduced drug-related deaths and HIV infection rates.",,False,True
We have received the conclusion of the Legal Department of Parliament that our project is not contrary to the constitution ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the actual conclusion provided by the Legal Department of Parliament regarding the project in question. Without access to the specific document or statement from the Legal Department, it is not possible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim.

However, if we assume that the statement accurately reflects the conclusion of the Legal Department, then the claim would be 'True'. If there is any doubt or lack of evidence to support the claim, it would be prudent to consider it 'Half True' or 'Mostly True' depending on the context and available information.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the query, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"The state spends 40 million in Georgian football every year, though football is nothing ... We have to finish the swamp in the Football Federation",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the state actually spends 40 million on Georgian football every year.
2. The context and implications of the statement regarding the Football Federation being a ""swamp.""

Without specific data on the exact amount the state spends on Georgian football annually, it's challenging to confirm the first part of the claim. Additionally, the term ""swamp"" is subjective and implies corruption or inefficiency, which would require evidence to substantiate.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the claim, it is difficult to fully verify its accuracy. Therefore, based on the information available:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The City Council is not legally authorized to oblige any executive body in the budget ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The City Council is not legally authorized to oblige any executive body in the budget,"" we need to consider the general roles and powers of city councils and executive bodies in municipal governance.

City councils typically have legislative authority, which includes the power to pass budgets, ordinances, and resolutions. However, the implementation and execution of the budget are usually the responsibility of the executive branch, such as the mayor or city manager. While the city council can set budgetary priorities and allocate funds, it generally cannot directly control how the executive body carries out its duties within the constraints of the approved budget.

Given this division of powers, the claim that the City Council is not legally authorized to oblige any executive body in the budget is generally accurate. The council can set the budget but cannot dictate the specific actions of the executive body beyond the budgetary framework.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"""Today [November 13] is more than the taxes received than it was last year.""",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the statement: ""Today [November 13] is more than the taxes received than it was last year.""

1. **Grammatical Analysis**: The statement is grammatically incorrect and unclear. It seems to be missing some words or context to make it a coherent sentence. A possible interpretation could be: ""Today [November 13], more taxes have been received than on the same date last year.""

2. **Factual Analysis**: Without specific data on tax receipts for November 13 of the current year and the previous year, it is impossible to verify the claim. The statement requires concrete financial data to be validated.

Given the lack of clarity and the absence of specific data to support or refute the claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize the statement as true or false.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
“Georgia has managed to export export to the Russian market.Today Russia's embargo imposition like this ...,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and the specific details provided. The claim states that ""Georgia has managed to export to the Russian market"" and mentions ""Russia's embargo imposition.""

1. **Georgia's Exports to Russia**: Historically, Georgia has exported various goods to Russia, including wine, mineral water, and agricultural products. There have been periods when trade relations were strained, but trade has generally continued.

2. **Russia's Embargo**: Russia has imposed embargoes on Georgian products at different times, particularly in response to political tensions. For example, in 2006, Russia banned Georgian wine and mineral water, citing quality concerns, which many viewed as politically motivated. However, these embargoes have been lifted and re-imposed at different times.

Given this context, the claim that ""Georgia has managed to export to the Russian market"" is accurate, but the statement about ""Russia's embargo imposition"" needs more context to be fully understood. The claim does not specify the time frame or the current status of the embargo.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"""I would like to remind you, no action, if it does not interfere with movement, does not need a prior permission.""",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context in which actions and permissions are being discussed. The statement suggests that any action that does not interfere with movement does not require prior permission. 

However, the necessity for prior permission can depend on various factors such as legal, organizational, or situational contexts. For example, in a workplace, certain actions might require prior permission regardless of whether they interfere with movement. Similarly, in public spaces, actions like setting up a stall or holding a demonstration might require permits even if they do not interfere with movement.

Given that the claim does not account for these nuances and generalizes the requirement for prior permission based solely on interference with movement, it is not entirely accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
There were more than 20 cases in parliament when the creation of a temporary investigation commission demanded the opposition ...,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""There were more than 20 cases in parliament when the creation of a temporary investigation commission demanded the opposition,"" we would need to verify historical records of parliamentary activities, specifically focusing on the instances where the opposition demanded the creation of such commissions.

Given the lack of specific data or context provided in the question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on documented parliamentary records and there is no contradictory evidence, it could be considered plausible.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"During the period of unnamed rule [the previous government], along with economic growth, it is also sharp ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the information provided and the context. The claim states that during the period of the previous government, there was economic growth and something else that is described as ""sharp"" but is not specified.

1. **Economic Growth**: If there is verifiable data showing that the economy grew during the period of the previous government, this part of the claim can be considered true.

2. **Sharp ...**: The statement is incomplete, making it difficult to assess what exactly was ""sharp."" This could refer to a variety of factors such as a sharp increase in inequality, inflation, unemployment, etc. Without this information, it is impossible to fully evaluate the claim.

Given the incomplete nature of the statement, it is not possible to definitively categorize it as true or false. The claim lacks sufficient detail to be fully assessed.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"“Our competitiveness improves.Lately, in the last 2 years, there will be a lot of progress ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Our competitiveness improves. Lately, in the last 2 years, there will be a lot of progress,"" we need to evaluate the context and evidence supporting it. 

1. **Competitiveness Improvement**: This can be measured by various indices such as the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) published by the World Economic Forum. If the country's ranking or score has improved over the last two years, this part of the claim could be considered true.

2. **Progress in the Last 2 Years**: This is a bit more subjective and can encompass various aspects such as economic growth, technological advancements, infrastructure development, etc. If there are significant positive changes in these areas, this part of the claim could also be considered true.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some observable improvements in competitiveness and progress, it might be reasonable to consider it as 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

Given the lack of specific data to fully verify the claim, a cautious approach would be to categorize it as 'Half True'.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"""Instead of creating new jobs, only 42,000 jobs were lost in 3 months.""",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Instead of creating new jobs, only 42,000 jobs were lost in 3 months,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Source**: The context in which the claim was made and the source of the data are crucial. If the claim is based on official labor statistics or a credible report, it would lend more credibility to the statement.

2. **Time Frame**: The specific 3-month period in question needs to be identified. Job numbers can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions, seasonal employment, and other factors.

3. **Net Job Losses**: The claim mentions a net loss of 42,000 jobs. This means that the total number of jobs lost exceeded the number of jobs created by 42,000 during the specified period.

4. **Verification**: Cross-referencing the claim with reliable sources such as government labor reports, economic research institutions, or reputable news outlets would help verify its accuracy.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and verified data, it would be considered 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies or lack of context, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the claim is partially correct but missing significant context or details, it could be 'Half True'. If the claim is largely incorrect but has some element of truth, it would be 'Mostly False'. If the claim is entirely incorrect, it would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data and context in the provided statement, I cannot definitively verify its accuracy. Therefore, I would need more information to make a precise determination.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"During the voting by a party representative, the voter lists from the desk lists independently ...",mostly false,ka,"The claim ""During the voting by a party representative, the voter lists from the desk lists independently ..."" is unclear and lacks context. It is not specific enough to determine its accuracy. Typically, voter lists are managed by election officials and not by party representatives. Without additional context or clarification, it is difficult to assess the truthfulness of the statement.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"“A few months ago, 113kg of heroin was seized when the previous government was all year old ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. Whether 113kg of heroin was indeed seized a few months ago.
2. Whether this event occurred when the previous government was still in power.

Without specific details or a reliable source to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure and typical context of such statements, it seems plausible that the claim could be partially accurate but lacks full context or verification.

Given the lack of concrete evidence and the need for more information to fully validate the claim, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"Emergency doctor in Tbilisi has a salary of GEL 1,500 and 400-500 GEL in Kutaisi",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim regarding the salaries of emergency doctors in Tbilisi and Kutaisi, we would need to verify the current salary data for emergency doctors in these cities. This information can typically be found through official government sources, healthcare industry reports, or reliable news articles.

As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have specific, up-to-date salary data for emergency doctors in Tbilisi and Kutaisi. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and accurate data, it could be evaluated as follows:

- The claim states that an emergency doctor in Tbilisi earns GEL 1,500.
- The claim also states that an emergency doctor in Kutaisi earns between GEL 400-500.

Given the significant difference in the reported salaries between the two cities, it would be important to cross-check this information with reliable sources. If the data aligns with the claim, it would be considered accurate. If there are discrepancies, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Without access to the specific and current salary data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided and the need for verification:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Crime statistics are supplied to Geostat, which is fully published in a quarter",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Crime statistics are supplied to Geostat, which is fully published in a quarter,"" we need to verify a few key points:

1. **Source of Crime Statistics**: Whether crime statistics are indeed supplied to Geostat.
2. **Publication Frequency**: Whether these statistics are fully published within a quarter (i.e., every three months).

**Verification**:

1. **Geostat's Role**: Geostat (National Statistics Office of Georgia) is responsible for collecting and publishing various statistical data, including crime statistics.
2. **Publication Schedule**: According to Geostat's official publications and reports, crime statistics are typically published on a quarterly basis.

Given this information, the claim appears to be accurate in both aspects: crime statistics are supplied to Geostat, and they are published quarterly.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
No new enterprises have been opened by the agricultural program,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""No new enterprises have been opened by the agricultural program,"" we would need to verify the specific details and outcomes of the agricultural program in question. This would involve checking records, reports, or credible sources that document the activities and results of the program.

Without access to this specific information, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is being evaluated based on available data and that no new enterprises have indeed been opened by the agricultural program, the claim would be 'True'. Conversely, if there is evidence that new enterprises have been opened, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to approach this:

1. **Check Official Reports:** Look for official reports or publications from the agricultural program.
2. **Consult Stakeholders:** Speak with stakeholders involved in the program.
3. **Review News Articles:** Search for news articles or press releases about the program's achievements.

If you have access to this information and it confirms that no new enterprises have been opened, then the claim is 'True'. If the information shows that new enterprises have been opened, then the claim is 'False'.

Final Answer: The accuracy of the claim cannot be determined without specific information.",,False,True
"""Georgia is today with low tax rates in the region""",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgia is today with low tax rates in the region,"" we need to consider the current tax rates in Georgia and compare them to those of neighboring countries in the region.

As of the latest data, Georgia is known for having relatively low tax rates compared to many other countries in its region. The country has implemented a flat income tax rate of 20%, a corporate tax rate of 15%, and a value-added tax (VAT) rate of 18%. These rates are generally lower than those in many neighboring countries.

For example:
- Armenia has a progressive income tax rate ranging from 23% to 36%, a corporate tax rate of 18%, and a VAT rate of 20%.
- Azerbaijan has a progressive income tax rate ranging from 14% to 25%, a corporate tax rate of 20%, and a VAT rate of 18%.
- Turkey has a progressive income tax rate ranging from 15% to 40%, a corporate tax rate of 25%, and a VAT rate of 18%.

Given this comparison, it is evident that Georgia's tax rates are indeed lower than those of several neighboring countries in the region.

The business will not have to pay for non -alcoholic beverages,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The business will not have to pay for non-alcoholic beverages,"" we need more context. Generally, businesses do have to pay for non-alcoholic beverages unless there is a specific arrangement or promotion that states otherwise. Without additional context or specific conditions that might exempt the business from paying, the claim is not accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"We have a disaster in all numbers: GDP per capita is reduced in dollars, private ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have a disaster in all numbers: GDP per capita is reduced in dollars, private ..."", we need to evaluate the specific data points mentioned and the context in which they are presented. The claim suggests a broad and severe decline in economic indicators, specifically mentioning GDP per capita.

1. **GDP per capita**: This is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people. If GDP per capita is indeed reduced in dollars, it would indicate a decline in economic performance per person.

2. **Context and Data**: To verify this, we would need to look at recent economic reports and data from reliable sources such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), or national statistics agencies. If recent data shows a significant decline in GDP per capita, the claim could be considered accurate.

3. **Other Indicators**: The claim mentions a ""disaster in all numbers,"" implying a widespread economic downturn. This would typically include other indicators such as unemployment rates, inflation, private sector performance, etc. Without specific data on these other indicators, it's challenging to fully validate the breadth of the claim.

Given the partial information provided and the need for specific data to confirm the extent of the economic decline, the claim can be evaluated as follows:

- If recent data shows a significant decline in GDP per capita but does not provide comprehensive evidence of a disaster in all economic indicators, the claim might be exaggerated.

Final Answer: **Half True**",half true,True,False
"34 million GEL is issued for compensations, billions have been spoken in Gakharia presentations",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""34 million GEL is issued for compensations, billions have been spoken in Gakharia presentations,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. **34 million GEL is issued for compensations**: This part of the claim can be verified by checking official government records, budget allocations, or announcements regarding compensation funds. If there is evidence that 34 million GEL has indeed been allocated for compensations, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Billions have been spoken in Gakharia presentations**: This part of the claim refers to the content of presentations made by Giorgi Gakharia, who served as the Prime Minister of Georgia. If Gakharia has indeed mentioned figures in the billions during his presentations, this part of the claim would also be true. This can be verified by reviewing transcripts, recordings, or summaries of his presentations.

Without specific evidence to confirm or refute these points, we can only make a general assessment based on the plausibility and available information.

Given that it is plausible for a government to allocate 34 million GEL for compensations and for a Prime Minister to discuss figures in the billions in various contexts (such as budgets, investments, or economic plans), the claim seems reasonable.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Interest rates are reduced to loans both legal and individuals.Decreased ...,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Interest rates are reduced to loans both legal and individuals. Decreased ..."", we need to analyze the statement in the context of general financial practices and current economic conditions.

1. **Interest Rates and Loans**: Interest rates can indeed be reduced for loans, and this can apply to both legal entities (such as businesses) and individuals. Central banks and financial institutions often adjust interest rates based on economic conditions.

2. **Current Economic Context**: If the statement is referring to a specific period where interest rates have been reduced, such as during an economic downturn or a policy change by a central bank, it could be accurate. However, without a specific timeframe or context, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy.

3. **General Practice**: In general, interest rates can be reduced for various reasons, including monetary policy decisions, economic stimulus measures, or competitive banking practices.

Given the lack of specific context and the general nature of the statement, it is partially accurate but lacks detail and specificity.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Since 2013, agriculture has increased significantly ... constant reduction from 2004 to 2012 ...",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether agriculture has indeed increased significantly since 2013.
2. Whether there was a constant reduction in agriculture from 2004 to 2012.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, we can analyze the structure of the statement.

The claim suggests a clear trend of reduction from 2004 to 2012, followed by a significant increase starting in 2013. If both parts of this trend are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If only one part is accurate, it would be 'Half True'. If neither part is accurate, it would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most cautious approach is to consider the possibility that one part might be accurate while the other might not be.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The introduction of visa regulations is not related to tourism or economic problems ... this reg ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The introduction of visa regulations is not related to tourism or economic problems,"" we need to consider the common reasons for implementing visa regulations. Visa regulations are typically introduced for various reasons, including:

1. **National Security**: To control who enters the country and prevent potential threats.
2. **Immigration Control**: To manage the number of people entering and staying in the country.
3. **Economic Factors**: To protect local jobs and manage the economic impact of immigration.
4. **Tourism Management**: To control the flow of tourists and ensure sustainable tourism practices.

Given that economic factors and tourism management are indeed common reasons for introducing visa regulations, the claim that visa regulations are ""not related to tourism or economic problems"" is misleading.

"Many citizens have been recorded for months, weeks at the Rustavi City Hall, and no one will meet them ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Many citizens have been recorded for months, weeks at the Rustavi City Hall, and no one will meet them,"" we would need to verify several aspects:

1. **Verification of Records**: Are there indeed records of many citizens waiting for months or weeks at Rustavi City Hall?
2. **Meeting with Officials**: Is it true that no one has met these citizens during this period?

Without specific evidence or data to confirm or refute these points, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that the claim is based on anecdotal evidence or reports from citizens, it might be partially true but not fully verifiable.

Given the lack of concrete evidence, the most balanced assessment would be:

“The manganese dioxide content in the air samples taken in the city of Zestafoni is 237 times the average ...,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The manganese dioxide content in the air samples taken in the city of Zestafoni is 237 times the average,"" we would need to verify several pieces of information:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Identify the origin of the claim and whether it comes from a credible source such as a scientific study, government report, or reputable news outlet.
2. **Average Manganese Dioxide Levels**: Establish what the ""average"" manganese dioxide content is, both globally and locally, to understand the baseline for comparison.
3. **Air Sample Data from Zestafoni**: Obtain the specific air sample data from Zestafoni to see if it indeed shows manganese dioxide levels that are 237 times higher than the established average.
4. **Context and Methodology**: Review the methodology used to collect and analyze the air samples to ensure the data is reliable and accurately represents the situation.

Without access to these specific details and data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible source and accurate data, it could be considered true. Conversely, if the claim lacks credible backing or is based on flawed data, it would be false.

Given the lack of specific information provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I must refrain from making a conclusive judgment.

Irakli Gharibashvili has been talking about economic indicators from improved [March this year],mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Irakli Gharibashvili has been talking about economic indicators from improved [March this year],"" we need to verify if there are any records or statements from Irakli Gharibashvili, the Prime Minister of Georgia, discussing improved economic indicators specifically from March of the current year.

1. **Check for Public Statements**: Look for any public statements, press releases, or interviews given by Irakli Gharibashvili around or after March of this year where he discusses economic indicators.
2. **Economic Reports**: Review economic reports or data released by the Georgian government or relevant economic institutions that show improvement in economic indicators starting from March of this year.
3. **Contextual Analysis**: Ensure that the context of the statements aligns with the claim, i.e., the indicators discussed are indeed showing improvement and are from the specified time frame.

Without access to real-time data or specific statements, I can provide a general approach:

- If there are verifiable statements or reports from Gharibashvili discussing improved economic indicators from March, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If there are statements but they are not specific to March or the indicators are not clearly improved, the claim might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.
- If there are no such statements or the indicators do not show improvement, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the need for specific verification and assuming no immediate access to such data:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
80% of the defense budget is spent on salaries,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""80% of the defense budget is spent on salaries,"" we need to look at the typical allocation of defense budgets. Defense budgets generally cover a wide range of expenses, including personnel salaries, operations and maintenance, procurement of equipment, research and development, and other costs.

In the United States, for example, the Department of Defense budget is divided into several categories:
1. Military Personnel (salaries and benefits)
2. Operations and Maintenance
3. Procurement
4. Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation
5. Military Construction
6. Family Housing

Historically, the portion of the U.S. defense budget allocated to military personnel (salaries and benefits) is significantly less than 80%. It is typically around 25-30%, with the rest being distributed among the other categories mentioned above.

Given this information, the claim that ""80% of the defense budget is spent on salaries"" is not accurate for the U.S. and likely not for other countries with similar defense budget structures.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"In March we had a 6%growth of the economy and predict an annual 5%forecast, high economic growth ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the components:

1. **6% Growth in March**: This suggests that the economy grew by 6% in a single month. Monthly growth rates are typically much smaller, and a 6% growth in one month is highly unusual and would be considered extremely high.

2. **Annual 5% Forecast**: This indicates that the economy is expected to grow by 5% over the entire year. Annual growth rates of 5% are plausible and can be considered high economic growth.

Given these points, the claim mixes an unusually high monthly growth rate with a plausible annual forecast. The statement ""high economic growth"" is subjective but aligns with the 5% annual forecast.

**Evaluation**:
- The 6% monthly growth is highly unlikely and not typical for economic reporting.
- The 5% annual forecast is reasonable and indicates high economic growth.

**Conclusion**:
The claim is partially accurate but contains an exaggerated monthly growth figure.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"“Unfortunately, we inherited the economy, with a negative trade balance of 50 percent ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""we inherited the economy, with a negative trade balance of 50 percent,"" we need to evaluate the context and the data regarding the trade balance at the time of the economic transition being referred to.

1. **Trade Balance Definition**: The trade balance is the difference between a country's exports and imports. A negative trade balance, also known as a trade deficit, means that the country imports more than it exports.

2. **Percentage Clarification**: A negative trade balance of 50 percent would imply that the value of imports is 50 percent greater than the value of exports.

3. **Historical Data**: To verify this claim, we would need to look at historical trade balance data for the specific country and time period in question. This data is typically available from national statistical agencies or international economic organizations.

Without specific historical data to reference, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is about a significant trade deficit, it is important to note that trade deficits of such magnitude are relatively rare and would be notable in economic reports.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, but considering the general economic context and the rarity of such a high trade deficit, the claim seems exaggerated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Administrative costs decreasing with respect to the budget,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Administrative costs decreasing with respect to the budget,"" we need to consider the context and the specific details of the situation. Generally, administrative costs can decrease as a percentage of the budget if the overall budget increases significantly while administrative costs remain relatively stable or grow at a slower rate. However, without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim.

Given the lack of specific information, the claim could be considered plausible but not definitively proven. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be:

"“During the previous government, for 8 years, 70km highway was constructed ... our team ...",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""During the previous government, for 8 years, 70km highway was constructed ... our team ..."", we would need to verify the specific data regarding highway construction during the previous government's tenure and compare it to the claim. This would involve checking official records, government reports, or credible sources that document the length of highways constructed during that period.

Without access to the specific data or additional context, it is not possible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, I cannot provide a final answer based on the information given.

"Current [tender] none stopped ... not stopped at the invitation of the contract, Pro ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the provided statement: ""Current [tender] none stopped ... not stopped at the invitation of the contract, Pro ...""

The statement is fragmented and lacks context, making it difficult to ascertain its meaning. However, based on the available information, it seems to suggest that no current tenders have been stopped and that the process has not been halted due to the contract invitation.

Given the ambiguity and lack of clear context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the interpretation that no tenders have been stopped and the process continues, we can make an educated guess.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"According to Nodar Khaduri, the budget costs did not cause the depreciation of the GEL",mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""According to Nodar Khaduri, the budget costs did not cause the depreciation of the GEL,"" we need to consider the context and the available evidence regarding Nodar Khaduri's statements and the factors influencing the depreciation of the Georgian Lari (GEL).

Nodar Khaduri, who served as the Minister of Finance of Georgia, has made public statements regarding the factors affecting the GEL. If he explicitly stated that budget costs were not the cause of the depreciation, then the claim would be accurate in representing his position.

However, the actual causes of currency depreciation can be multifaceted, involving factors such as economic policies, external economic conditions, market speculation, and more. The accuracy of the claim in a broader economic context would require a detailed analysis of these factors.

Given that the claim is about what Nodar Khaduri stated, and assuming there is no misrepresentation of his words:

"""The detainees are mainly released on the basis of a plea agreement""",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The detainees are mainly released on the basis of a plea agreement,"" we need to consider the context and available data regarding detainee releases. 

1. **Detainees**: This term can refer to individuals held in various types of detention, such as criminal suspects, immigration detainees, or prisoners of war. The context is crucial.
2. **Plea Agreement**: This is a deal between the defendant and prosecutor where the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge or to one of multiple charges in exchange for some concession from the prosecutor, often a lighter sentence or the dropping of other charges.

### Criminal Justice System:
In the criminal justice system, plea agreements are indeed a common method for resolving cases. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, over 90% of criminal cases are resolved through plea bargains rather than trials. This suggests that a significant number of detainees in the criminal justice system are released based on plea agreements.

### Immigration Detention:
In the context of immigration detention, releases are typically based on factors such as asylum claims, bond hearings, or deportation orders rather than plea agreements. 

### Military or Political Detainees:
For military or political detainees, releases are often based on negotiations, diplomatic agreements, or changes in policy rather than plea agreements.

Given the broad scope of the term ""detainees"" and the varying contexts in which they are held, the claim's accuracy can vary significantly. However, if we focus on the criminal justice system, where plea agreements are prevalent, the claim holds more weight.

### Conclusion:
The claim ""The detainees are mainly released on the basis of a plea agreement"" is context-dependent. It is mostly true in the context of the criminal justice system but not necessarily in other contexts like immigration or military detention.

"Partnership Fund is a loss for 4 years, GEL 700 million",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Partnership Fund is a loss for 4 years, GEL 700 million,"" we need to verify the financial performance of the Partnership Fund over the specified period and the total amount of the loss.

1. **Time Frame**: The claim specifies a period of 4 years.
2. **Amount**: The claim states a total loss of GEL 700 million.

To verify this, we would need access to the financial statements or credible reports on the Partnership Fund's performance over the last 4 years. This includes annual reports, audited financial statements, or credible news sources that provide detailed financial information.

Without access to these specific documents or data, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified financial data, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the Partnership Fund has indeed reported losses for each of the past 4 years and the cumulative loss amounts to GEL 700 million, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the losses are close to GEL 700 million but not exact, or if the losses occurred over a slightly different time frame, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.
- If the losses are significantly different from GEL 700 million or the time frame is incorrect, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific financial data in this context, we cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on accurate data, we can make an educated guess.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False

This involves checking the performance of various industries within the real sector during that period.

However, without access to specific economic reports or data from the first quarter of 2013, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided and the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the statement, I cannot accurately categorize the claim.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
Prices for basic use of medicines decreased by 20-23%,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Prices for basic use of medicines decreased by 20-23%,"" we would need to verify it against reliable data sources such as government reports, pharmaceutical industry statistics, or credible news articles. 

Without access to specific data or sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to assess it:

1. **Check Official Reports**: Look for recent reports from health departments or pharmaceutical regulatory bodies that track medicine prices.
2. **Industry Analysis**: Review analyses from reputable market research firms that monitor drug pricing trends.
3. **News Articles**: Search for recent news articles from credible sources that discuss changes in medicine prices.

If these sources confirm a decrease in prices within the specified range, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If they show a different trend or no significant change, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'. If the data is mixed or unclear, 'Half True' might be appropriate.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer.

"If we compare the 2012 and 2016 parliamentary elections, the support of the Georgian Dream has increased",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""the support of the Georgian Dream has increased"" when comparing the 2012 and 2016 parliamentary elections, we need to look at the election results for both years.

In the 2012 parliamentary elections, the Georgian Dream coalition won a significant victory, securing 85 out of 150 seats in the Parliament of Georgia, which was a major shift in power from the United National Movement.

In the 2016 parliamentary elections, the Georgian Dream party (no longer a coalition) won an even larger majority, securing 115 out of 150 seats in the Parliament.

Based on these results, the Georgian Dream increased its number of seats from 85 in 2012 to 115 in 2016, indicating an increase in parliamentary support.

"The norm that prohibited taxes without referendum, one of the investors' attraction c ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and specifics of the norm mentioned. The claim states that a norm prohibiting taxes without a referendum is one of the attractions for investors. 

1. **Norm Prohibiting Taxes Without Referendum**: Some jurisdictions have laws or constitutional provisions that require voter approval for new taxes or tax increases. For example, California's Proposition 13 requires a two-thirds majority in the legislature for state tax increases and local tax increases to be approved by voters.

2. **Attraction for Investors**: Investors often seek stable and predictable tax environments. A norm that requires a referendum for tax changes can provide a level of predictability and stability, as it makes sudden or unexpected tax increases less likely. This can indeed be attractive to investors who are looking for a stable investment climate.

Given these points, the claim that such a norm is an attraction for investors has a basis in reality. However, the degree to which it is an attraction can vary depending on other factors such as the overall economic environment, regulatory framework, and political stability.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Two out of every three people in Georgia die due to diseases caused by tobacco smoking,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Two out of every three people in Georgia die due to diseases caused by tobacco smoking,"" we need to examine available data on smoking-related deaths and overall mortality rates in Georgia.

1. **General Statistics on Smoking-Related Deaths**: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smoking is responsible for about 1 in 5 deaths in the United States. This translates to approximately 20% of all deaths being attributable to smoking-related diseases.

2. **Specific Data for Georgia**: While state-specific data may vary slightly, it is unlikely to deviate significantly from the national average. The claim that two out of every three people (approximately 66.7%) die due to smoking-related diseases is significantly higher than the national average.

3. **Health Organizations' Reports**: Health organizations such as the American Lung Association and the Georgia Department of Public Health provide data that align more closely with the national average, indicating that smoking-related deaths are a significant but not overwhelmingly dominant cause of mortality.

Given this information, the claim that ""Two out of every three people in Georgia die due to diseases caused by tobacco smoking"" is an overstatement and not supported by available data.

Final Answer: 'False'",false,False,False
"“Four normative acts are obliged to protect the population from GM, including ...",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Four normative acts are obliged to protect the population from GM,"" we need to consider the context and the specific regulations or laws in place regarding genetically modified organisms (GMOs). 

Normative acts refer to laws, regulations, or standards that are established to guide behavior and ensure safety. In many countries, there are indeed multiple regulations and laws aimed at protecting the population from potential risks associated with GMOs. These can include acts related to food safety, environmental protection, labeling, and biotechnology.

However, the exact number of normative acts and their specific obligations can vary significantly from one country to another. Without specific details about the country or the exact normative acts being referred to, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim.

Given the general nature of the statement and the common practice of having multiple regulations in place for GMOs, the claim could be considered plausible but not definitively verifiable without more context.

"""Georgia is still in 15 countries of biodiversity ...""",half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Georgia is still in 15 countries of biodiversity,"" we need to clarify what is meant by ""countries of biodiversity."" Typically, this phrase might refer to biodiversity hotspots or regions recognized for their rich variety of species and ecosystems.

Georgia, the country located at the intersection of Europe and Asia, is known for its diverse ecosystems and is part of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot. However, the specific number ""15 countries of biodiversity"" does not align with any standard classification or list of biodiversity hotspots or regions.

Given the lack of clear and verifiable information supporting the specific number ""15"" in relation to Georgia's biodiversity status, the claim appears to be inaccurate.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the Ministry of Health has released any official statements or reports confirming this reduction.
2. **Time Frame**: Ensure that the data covers the period from 2013 to the present.
3. **Specificity of the Number**: Confirm that the number 128,000 is accurate and pertains specifically to socially vulnerable individuals.
4. **Context and Interpretation**: Understand what is meant by ""socially vulnerable"" and how this group is defined and measured by the Ministry of Health.

Without access to specific data or official reports from the Ministry of Health, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on some form of official data, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim and the need for precise verification, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

This would involve checking reliable sources such as trade reports, government statistics, or industry analyses.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and reflects a real reduction in car export exchange flows from 700 million to 180 million, the claim would be 'True'.

This year in Khoni will end almost every village gasification,true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""This year in Khoni will end almost every village gasification,"" we need to verify the current status and plans for gasification in Khoni. This involves checking official statements, government plans, and progress reports related to gasification in the region.

1. **Official Statements and Plans**: If there are official announcements or plans from the government or relevant authorities indicating that the gasification of almost every village in Khoni will be completed this year, this would support the claim.

2. **Progress Reports**: If there are progress reports or updates showing that the gasification process is nearing completion in most villages in Khoni, this would also support the claim.

3. **Independent Verification**: If independent sources or news reports corroborate the information that almost every village in Khoni will be gasified by the end of this year, this would further validate the claim.

Without access to specific and up-to-date information on the gasification status in Khoni, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on reliable sources and there is substantial evidence pointing towards the completion of gasification in most villages by the end of the year, the claim could be considered accurate.

"“According to the United Nations by 2050, the population of Georgia is expected to decrease a million 170 thousand ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""According to the United Nations by 2050, the population of Georgia is expected to decrease a million 170 thousand,"" we need to refer to the United Nations' population projections.

The United Nations provides population projections through its Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA). According to the World Population Prospects 2019, the population of Georgia is indeed projected to decline. The population in 2020 was approximately 3.7 million, and it is projected to decrease to around 2.5 million by 2050. This represents a decrease of about 1.2 million, which aligns closely with the claim of a decrease of ""a million 170 thousand.""

1. **Identify Nika Gvaramia**: Nika Gvaramia is a well-known Georgian lawyer, politician, and media executive. He has held various positions, including being the director of the opposition TV channel Mtavari Arkhi.

2. **Current Status**: As of the latest available information, there is no public record or announcement indicating that Nika Gvaramia has left his position for study abroad. 

3. **Verification**: Cross-referencing multiple reliable sources, including news articles, official statements, and social media updates, shows no evidence supporting the claim that he has left his post for study abroad.

“In 2013 and 2014 we will pay more money from the budget than we borrow.During this period the government 1 ...,mostly false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In 2013 and 2014 we will pay more money from the budget than we borrow,"" we need to examine the financial data and budget reports from those years. Specifically, we need to look at the government's budgetary outflows (expenditures) and inflows (revenues) and compare them to the amount borrowed during those years.

1. **Budget Surplus/Deficit**: If the government had a budget surplus in 2013 and 2014, it would mean that revenues exceeded expenditures, which could support the claim.
2. **Borrowing Data**: We need to check the actual borrowing figures for those years. If the government borrowed less than it paid out from the budget, the claim could be true.

Without specific data, we can only make an educated guess based on general trends and available information from those years. Historically, many governments run budget deficits, meaning they borrow more than they pay out. However, there could be exceptions based on economic conditions, policy changes, or other factors.

Given the general trend of budget deficits in many countries during that period, it is likely that the claim is not entirely accurate. However, without specific data, we cannot definitively say.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
"“The former government signed a hidden contract in 2012, which is surrounded by Territory of Tbilisi Sea ...",false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The former government signed a hidden contract in 2012, which is surrounded by Territory of Tbilisi Sea,"" we would need to verify several key points:

1. **Existence of a Contract**: Was there indeed a contract signed by the former government in 2012?
2. **Nature of the Contract**: Was the contract ""hidden"" or not publicly disclosed?
3. **Geographical Context**: Is the contract related to the area around the Tbilisi Sea?

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm these details, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and the need for verification of multiple aspects, it leans towards being speculative without concrete evidence.

- 2015: 100 million
- 2016: 50 million

Without access to the actual financial data or authoritative sources confirming these figures, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the figures are accurate based on available information or credible sources, we could evaluate the claim accordingly.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate response would be to acknowledge the uncertainty.

If the relevant authorities or representatives have explicitly stated that they will not make such a promise, then the claim would be 'True'. If there is ambiguity or conflicting statements, the rating might vary.

Without additional context or specific statements from the relevant authorities, it is challenging to definitively rate the claim. However, based on the information provided:

1. **Source of Information**: Check if there are credible reports or audits that confirm the expenditure and its ineffectiveness.
2. **Details of Expenditure**: Understand what the 73,000 GEL was spent on and why it is considered ineffective.
3. **Context and Evidence**: Look for context around the spending, such as official statements, financial reports, or news articles that provide evidence of the claim.

Without specific evidence or sources to verify the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible audit or report, we can make an informed judgment.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I will base my response on the assumption that there is some credible source behind the claim but not enough detailed information to fully verify it.

"According to general trends, international investments in the world are diminishing, while in Georgia, on the contrary, it is growing",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine recent data and trends regarding international investments globally and specifically in Georgia.

1. **Global Trends in International Investments:**
   - According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) World Investment Report, global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows have experienced fluctuations. For instance, global FDI flows fell significantly in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but showed signs of recovery in 2021 and 2022.
   - However, the overall trend in recent years has been mixed, with some periods of decline and others of growth, influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, and policy changes.

2. **Trends in International Investments in Georgia:**
   - According to the National Statistics Office of Georgia (Geostat) and other economic reports, Georgia has seen an increase in FDI in recent years. The country has been actively working to attract foreign investments through various reforms, improving the business environment, and offering incentives to investors.
   - Specific data from Geostat indicates that FDI in Georgia has been on an upward trend, particularly in sectors like energy, real estate, and financial services.

Given this information, the claim that international investments globally are diminishing while they are growing in Georgia can be evaluated as follows:

- The global trend in international investments is not uniformly diminishing; it has shown both declines and recoveries.
- In contrast, Georgia has indeed experienced growth in international investments in recent years.

Therefore, the claim is somewhat accurate but not entirely reflective of the global situation.

The claim suggests that the bill implies that the report of each Georgian citizen and all business organizations is affected in some way. 

Without specific details about the bill, such as its provisions, scope, and intent, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if the bill indeed includes provisions that impact the reporting or data collection of all Georgian citizens and business organizations, the claim could be considered accurate. Conversely, if the bill only affects a subset of the population or specific types of businesses, the claim would be less accurate.

Given the lack of specific information about the bill, it is prudent to err on the side of caution and consider the claim as potentially overstated.

1. Whether the prize amount in 2012 was indeed reduced by 11 million GEL.
2. Whether Ms. Irma's family member, David Dagelashvili, received a prize of 10 thousand GEL in public service.
3. Whether the context of the claim about immorality and bonuses is accurately represented.

Without specific data or evidence to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure and the nature of the claim, it appears to be a mix of factual information and subjective interpretation.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the claim, it would be prudent to categorize it as 'Half True' since it contains elements that could be factual but lacks full verification and context.

"""Car trade is reduced, which is an expression of inability from the authorities""",mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Car trade is reduced, which is an expression of inability from the authorities,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Car Trade Reduction**: Whether the car trade has indeed reduced can be verified through market data and statistics. If there is a significant reduction in car trade, this part of the claim could be true.

2. **Expression of Inability from Authorities**: This part of the claim is more subjective and requires an analysis of the reasons behind the reduction in car trade. A reduction in car trade could be due to various factors such as economic downturns, changes in consumer preferences, supply chain issues, or policy changes. It is not necessarily an expression of inability from the authorities unless there is clear evidence that the authorities' actions or inactions directly caused the reduction.

Given that the claim combines an objective statement (reduction in car trade) with a subjective interpretation (expression of inability from authorities), the overall truthfulness of the claim depends on the context and evidence available.

Without specific data and context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, the assertion that a reduction in car trade is directly an expression of inability from the authorities is a broad generalization and may not be entirely accurate.

“The problem is the training of judges.Nothing has been done in terms of large -scale training of judges. ”,false,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and available evidence regarding the training of judges. 

1. **True**: The claim would be true if there has been absolutely no large-scale training of judges.
2. **Mostly True**: The claim would be mostly true if there has been very little or insufficient large-scale training of judges.
3. **Half True**: The claim would be half true if there has been some training, but it is not comprehensive or widespread.
4. **Mostly False**: The claim would be mostly false if there has been significant training, but perhaps not to the extent that some might consider ""large-scale.""
5. **False**: The claim would be false if there has been substantial and effective large-scale training of judges.

Given the complexity and variability in judicial training programs across different regions and countries, it is difficult to make a blanket statement without specific data. However, many countries have established judicial training institutes and programs aimed at continuous education and training of judges. For example, the United States has the Federal Judicial Center, and many other countries have similar institutions.

Without specific evidence to support the claim that ""nothing has been done in terms of large-scale training of judges,"" it is likely that the claim is an overstatement.

"During the previous government, the Georgian economy was growing faster because the world economy was growing twice as strong as it is now",false,ka,"To evaluate the claim ""During the previous government, the Georgian economy was growing faster because the world economy was growing twice as strong as it is now,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Economic Data**: We need to compare the growth rates of the Georgian economy during the previous government with the current period.
2. **Global Economic Growth**: We need to compare the global economic growth rates during the previous government with the current period.
3. **Causation vs. Correlation**: We need to determine if the faster growth of the Georgian economy can be directly attributed to the global economic growth rates.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Georgian Economic Growth**:
   - Identify the time period of the ""previous government"" and the current period.
   - Look at the GDP growth rates of Georgia during these periods.

2. **Global Economic Growth**:
   - Identify the global economic growth rates during the same periods.
   - Compare these rates to see if the global economy was indeed growing ""twice as strong.""

3. **Causation**:
   - Assess if the faster growth of the Georgian economy can be directly linked to the global economic growth rates or if other factors (e.g., domestic policies, investments, etc.) played a significant role.

### Data Collection:

- **Previous Government Period**: Assume the previous government refers to a specific administration (e.g., 2012-2020).
- **Current Period**: Assume the current period refers to the administration post-2020.
- **Georgian GDP Growth Rates**: Historical data from World Bank or IMF.
- **Global GDP Growth Rates**: Historical data from World Bank or IMF.

### Hypothetical Data (for illustration):

- **Georgian GDP Growth**:
  - Previous Government (2012-2020): Average growth rate of 4.5%.
  - Current Period (2020-2023): Average growth rate of 2.5%.

- **Global GDP Growth**:
  - Previous Government (2012-2020): Average growth rate of 3.5%.
  - Current Period (2020-2023): Average growth rate of 1.75%.

### Analysis:

- The global economy was growing twice as strong during the previous government (3.5% vs. 1.75%).
- The Georgian economy was growing faster during the previous government (4.5% vs. 2.5%).

### Conclusion:

Based on the hypothetical data, the claim that the Georgian economy was growing faster because the world economy was growing twice as strong appears to be supported by the data. However, without concrete data and considering other potential influencing factors, the claim might not be fully accurate.

The Constitutional Court bought new cars worth half a million GEL,mostly true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Constitutional Court bought new cars worth half a million GEL,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there are credible sources or official statements confirming the purchase of new cars by the Constitutional Court.
2. **Amount Verification**: Confirm if the total cost of the cars is indeed half a million GEL.

Without access to real-time data or specific sources, I cannot verify the claim directly. However, if we assume that the information provided is based on a reliable source, we can analyze it as follows:

- If the Constitutional Court did purchase new cars and the total cost is exactly half a million GEL, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the purchase happened but the amount is slightly different, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True' depending on the discrepancy.
- If the purchase did not happen or the amount is significantly different, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is based on a reliable source, I would lean towards:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Russian troops I have withdrawn from Georgia,half true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Russian troops have withdrawn from Georgia,"" we need to consider the historical and current context of Russian military presence in Georgia.

1. **Historical Context**: 
   - In 2008, Russia and Georgia fought a brief war over the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Following the war, Russia recognized these regions as independent states, although this recognition is not widely accepted internationally.
   - Since the 2008 conflict, Russian troops have been stationed in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

2. **Current Context**:
   - As of the latest information available up to 2023, Russian troops remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. These regions are internationally recognized as part of Georgia, but they are under de facto control of Russia and the local separatist authorities.
   - There have been no significant reports or announcements indicating a full withdrawal of Russian troops from these regions.

Given this context, the claim that ""Russian troops have withdrawn from Georgia"" is not accurate because Russian military presence continues in the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are internationally recognized as part of Georgia.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"Due to new regulations on loans, up to GEL 5,000 is reduced by 26%in February",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Due to new regulations on loans, up to GEL 5,000 is reduced by 26% in February,"" we need to verify several aspects:

1. **Existence of New Regulations**: Are there indeed new regulations on loans that have been implemented?
2. **Specificity of the Amount**: Do these regulations specifically affect loans up to GEL 5,000?
3. **Percentage Reduction**: Is the reduction exactly 26%?

Without specific details or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to verify the claim fully. However, if we assume that the new regulations do exist and they specifically target loans up to GEL 5,000, the exact percentage reduction would still need to be confirmed.

Given the lack of detailed information and verification, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Wine exports from Georgia have increased by 60%.We have a special growth in China, France ...",true,ka,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Wine exports from Georgia have increased by 60%,"" and that there is ""special growth in China, France,"" we need to verify the data from reliable sources such as trade reports, government statistics, or industry analyses.

1. **Wine Exports Increase by 60%**: 
   - If recent data from the Georgian National Wine Agency or other credible sources confirm that wine exports have indeed increased by 60%, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Special Growth in China and France**:
   - If the same sources indicate significant growth in wine exports specifically to China and France, this part of the claim would also be true.

Without access to the latest data, we can only hypothesize based on historical trends. Georgia has been increasing its wine exports in recent years, with notable growth in markets like China. However, France is traditionally a wine-exporting country, and significant growth in exports to France would be less common.

Given the need for precise data to confirm both parts of the claim, and assuming the general trend of increasing exports is accurate but specific details about France might be less certain:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
