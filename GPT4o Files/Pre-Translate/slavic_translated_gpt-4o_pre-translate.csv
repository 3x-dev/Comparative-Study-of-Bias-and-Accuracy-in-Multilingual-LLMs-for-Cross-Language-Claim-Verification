"""There are different excise dates in other European countries to different quality of petroleum products.""",mostly false,sr,"The claim states that ""There are different excise dates in other European countries to different quality of petroleum products."" This statement is somewhat unclear and ambiguous, but it seems to be suggesting that different European countries have different excise tax rates or dates of implementation for various qualities of petroleum products.

In reality, excise taxes on petroleum products do vary across European countries, and these taxes can be influenced by the quality or type of the petroleum product (e.g., diesel vs. gasoline, high-sulfur vs. low-sulfur fuels). However, the term ""excise dates"" is not commonly used in this context, and it is unclear what is meant by it. If the intention is to refer to the dates when different excise tax rates are applied or changed, this can also vary by country.

Given the ambiguity of the term ""excise dates"" but acknowledging the general truth that excise taxes on petroleum products do vary across European countries, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not entirely clear.

"""As for the tram, they could not pass because of the gathered citizens, and the traffic was normalized after the end of the protest.""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the tram could not pass due to gathered citizens.
2. Whether the traffic was normalized after the end of the protest.

Without specific evidence or context, such as news reports, eyewitness accounts, or official statements, it is challenging to definitively verify these points. However, the claim seems plausible as protests often disrupt public transportation and traffic, which typically normalizes after the protest ends.

Given the general plausibility but lack of specific evidence, the claim can be considered as having a reasonable basis but not fully verifiable.

"The median size of the average salary in January was 112 thousand tenge.And the modal, that is, the most common salary, is 58 thousand tenge.",true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the definitions and implications of the terms used:

1. **Median Salary**: The median salary is the middle value in a list of salaries sorted in ascending order. This means that half of the people earn less than the median salary, and half earn more.

2. **Modal Salary**: The modal salary is the most frequently occurring salary in the dataset.

The claim states:
- The median size of the average salary in January was 112 thousand tenge.
- The modal, that is, the most common salary, is 58 thousand tenge.

Given these definitions, the claim can be evaluated as follows:
- The median salary being 112 thousand tenge means that this is the middle value of the sorted salary list.
- The modal salary being 58 thousand tenge means that this is the salary that appears most frequently in the dataset.

Without additional data to verify these specific figures, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim. The claim correctly uses the terms ""median"" and ""modal"" in their proper contexts. Therefore, if we assume the figures provided are accurate, the claim is logically consistent.

"""The Democratic Party filled everything that promised four years ago.""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Democratic Party filled everything that promised four years ago,"" we need to evaluate the promises made by the Democratic Party four years ago and assess whether they have been fulfilled. This involves examining key policy areas such as healthcare, economy, climate change, social justice, and more.

Given the complexity and breadth of political promises, it is unlikely that any party can fulfill every single promise made. Typically, some promises are fully met, some are partially met, and others are not met at all due to various factors such as political opposition, economic constraints, or changing priorities.

Without specific details and a comprehensive analysis of each promise, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general knowledge and typical political outcomes, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is an overstatement.

There is no credible evidence or scientific basis to support the claim that Israeli paracetamol causes death on the sixth day of admission. Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) is a widely used over-the-counter medication for pain relief and fever reduction, and it is generally considered safe when used as directed.

"""In March, the first positive signals appeared in terms of employment, because a slight increase in the number of employees was recorded, but it will only be seen whether it will mean the beginning of the new trend.""",mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the following components:

1. **Timing**: The claim specifies that the first positive signals appeared in March.
2. **Employment Data**: It mentions a slight increase in the number of employees.
3. **Trend Prediction**: It cautiously states that it remains to be seen whether this increase will signify the beginning of a new trend.

Given that the claim is cautious and does not definitively state that a new trend has begun, but rather that it is a possibility, it is important to consider the context and the data available at the time.

If the data from March indeed shows a slight increase in employment, the claim would be accurate in reporting the observed data and the cautious interpretation of its implications.

Without specific data to contradict the claim, it appears to be a reasonable and cautious statement based on the information provided.

The claim states that there are no delays for water polo players and that the government has settled all obligations to the athletes. Additionally, it mentions that the speaker has personal experience and pride in the current situation.

Without additional context or evidence to verify the specific details of the government's obligations and the current status of support for water polo players, it is challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, the statement does include a personal perspective, which may not fully represent the broader situation.

""",mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. **Allocations for science in Serbia being 1% of GDP**: According to various reports and data from international organizations like UNESCO and the World Bank, Serbia's investment in research and development (R&D) has historically been around 1% of GDP, which is indeed lower than the EU average.

2. **EU average being about 2% of GDP in 2013**: The EU's average investment in R&D has been around 2% of GDP, with some variations depending on the specific year and source, but 2% is a reasonable approximation for 2013.

3. **Private sector investments in science in Serbia being 7.5% of all investments**: This figure is consistent with reports indicating that Serbia's private sector investment in R&D is relatively low compared to the EU average.

4. **EU average private sector investments being 55% of all investments**: The EU average for private sector investment in R&D is indeed around 55%, which is significantly higher than Serbia's 7.5%.

1. Whether Poland currently spends 2% of its GDP on defense.
2. Whether Poland has announced plans to increase this spending to 2.5% of its GDP.

1. **Current Defense Spending**: According to NATO guidelines, member countries are encouraged to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. Poland has been one of the countries meeting this target. Reports and official statements from recent years confirm that Poland has been spending around 2% of its GDP on defense.

2. **Future Defense Spending Plans**: There have been official announcements from the Polish government indicating plans to increase defense spending. For instance, in recent years, Poland has expressed intentions to raise its defense budget to 2.5% of GDP in response to regional security concerns and commitments to NATO.

Given this information, the claim that Poland currently spends 2% of its GDP on defense and has announced plans to increase this to 2.5% is accurate.

"In Kazakhstan, from 20 to 40 tons of various narcotic substances is seized annually.",true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Kazakhstan, from 20 to 40 tons of various narcotic substances is seized annually,"" we need to look at reliable sources such as government reports, international drug control agencies, or reputable news organizations that provide data on drug seizures in Kazakhstan.

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and other relevant sources, Kazakhstan has been a significant transit country for narcotics, particularly opiates originating from Afghanistan. However, the specific figures for annual drug seizures can vary.

If we find that the data from these sources consistently show that the amount of narcotic substances seized annually in Kazakhstan falls within the range of 20 to 40 tons, then the claim would be considered accurate. If the data shows figures significantly outside this range, the claim would be less accurate.

Based on available data, if the figures generally align with the claim, it would be rated as 'Mostly True' or 'True'. If the figures are somewhat close but not consistently within the range, it might be 'Half True'. If the figures are significantly different, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the need for precise data and the variability in annual reports, the most accurate assessment based on available information is:

This requires access to specific information about the legislative activities and communications between the Assembly and the government.

Given that I do not have access to real-time data or specific records of the Assembly's proposals to the government, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on verifiable and accurate information, we can analyze it as follows:

- If there is documented evidence that no pro-European legal proposals have been sent by the Assembly to the government, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there is some evidence of such proposals but not enough to fully contradict the claim, it might be 'Mostly True'.
- If there is a mix of evidence both supporting and contradicting the claim, it would be 'Half True'.
- If there is significant evidence of pro-European legal proposals being sent, but the claim is not entirely false, it would be 'Mostly False'.
- If there is clear and substantial evidence that multiple pro-European legal proposals have been sent by the Assembly, the claim would be 'False'.

Without specific evidence, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and the need for verifiable evidence, I will provide a reasoned judgment.

More than 4.5 million citizens left without temporary income received assistance in the amount of 42 thousand 500 tenge.More than 450 billion tenge was spent on this,true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Number of citizens receiving assistance**: The claim states that more than 4.5 million citizens received assistance.
2. **Amount of assistance per citizen**: Each citizen received 42,500 tenge.
3. **Total amount spent**: More than 450 billion tenge was spent.

Let's do the math to verify the consistency of these figures:

- If each of the 4.5 million citizens received 42,500 tenge, the total amount spent would be:
  \[
  4,500,000 \text{ citizens} \times 42,500 \text{ tenge/citizen} = 191,250,000,000 \text{ tenge}
  \]

- The claim states that more than 450 billion tenge was spent. However, our calculation shows that the total amount spent should be around 191.25 billion tenge, which is significantly less than 450 billion tenge.

Given this discrepancy, the claim that more than 450 billion tenge was spent does not align with the calculated total based on the number of citizens and the amount of assistance per citizen.

"""And that people buy water more, because it became fashion and do not believe in our Czech that otherwise excellent quality, as well as bottled water.""",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""People buy water more, because it became fashion.""
2. ""Do not believe in our Czech that otherwise excellent quality, as well as bottled water.""

1. The first part of the claim suggests that the increase in bottled water purchases is due to it becoming fashionable. There is some evidence to support this, as marketing and lifestyle trends have indeed made bottled water a popular choice among consumers. However, other factors such as convenience, perceived health benefits, and distrust in tap water quality also play significant roles.

2. The second part of the claim implies that Czech tap water is of excellent quality, comparable to bottled water, but people do not believe in its quality. According to various reports and studies, Czech tap water is generally of high quality and safe to drink. However, public perception can sometimes be influenced by marketing and misinformation, leading people to prefer bottled water.

Given these points, the claim has elements of truth but also oversimplifies the reasons behind the increase in bottled water consumption.

A security certificate, such as an SSL/TLS certificate, is indeed used to secure communications over the internet, ensuring data integrity and privacy between the user's browser and the server. This helps protect against hackers and various cyber threats. However, the term ""Internet meshs"" is not commonly used in this context, and ""cyberism"" is not a standard term in cybersecurity.

Given that the primary purpose of security certificates is accurately described but the terminology is somewhat inaccurate or unclear, the claim is not entirely precise.

1. **Nursery Space Requirements**: 
   - The claim states that from 2018, one child in a nursery may have 2.25 m² of space, and in nurseries and children's clubs operating up to 5 hours per day, the space can be as low as 1.87 m².

2. **Prisoner Space Requirements**:
   - The claim mentions that prisoners are allocated 3 m² of space.

### Verification:
- **Nursery Space Requirements**: 
  - According to various regulations and guidelines, the space requirements for children in nurseries can vary by country and specific local regulations. However, the figures mentioned (2.25 m² and 1.87 m²) are plausible and align with some known standards in certain regions.

- **Prisoner Space Requirements**:
  - The space allocated per prisoner can also vary by country and specific regulations. The figure of 3 m² is a commonly cited minimum standard in some jurisdictions, though it can be higher in others.

### Conclusion:
- The claim accurately reflects the space requirements for children in nurseries and children's clubs as well as the comparison to the space allocated per prisoner. The figures provided are consistent with known standards and regulations in some regions.

"""Due to the reduced customs customs, computers, technical goods, furniture, textiles and many other products are cheaped from EU.",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the impact of reduced customs duties on the prices of various products imported from the EU.

1. **Customs Duties and Prices**: Reduced customs duties generally lower the cost of importing goods, which can lead to lower prices for consumers. This is because importers and retailers can pass on the savings from reduced tariffs to the end consumers.

2. **Types of Goods Mentioned**: The claim specifically mentions computers, technical goods, furniture, textiles, and many other products. These categories are broad and encompass a wide range of items that are commonly imported from the EU.

3. **Economic Factors**: While reduced customs duties can lead to lower prices, other factors such as exchange rates, supply chain costs, and market demand also play significant roles in determining final consumer prices. Therefore, the reduction in customs duties does not guarantee that all products will be cheaper, but it does make it more likely.

4. **Generalization**: The claim makes a broad generalization that many products are cheaper due to reduced customs duties. While this is likely true for many products, it may not be universally true for all products in the mentioned categories.

Considering these points, the claim is generally accurate but may not apply universally to every single product within the mentioned categories.

1. **State Budget Deficit Trend**: 
   - If recent data shows a consistent decrease in the state budget deficit, this part of the claim would be accurate.

2. **Current State Budget Deficit**:
   - If the most recent official figures indicate that the deficit is 28.5 billion PLN, this part of the claim would be accurate.

3. **State Budget Deficit During PO-PSL Rule**:
   - Historical data needs to confirm that the deficit reached 100 billion PLN during the 2010/11 period under the PO-PSL government.

Without access to the most recent and historical financial data, it's challenging to verify these points definitively. However, assuming the data provided in the claim is accurate, the statement would be evaluated as follows:

- If all three points are correct, the claim would be 'True'.

Polish society ages the fastest in Europe.,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Polish society ages the fastest in Europe,"" we need to examine demographic data and projections related to aging populations across European countries.

1. **Population Aging Metrics**: The rate at which a society ages can be measured by the increase in the median age of the population, the proportion of elderly people (typically those aged 65 and over), and the dependency ratio (the ratio of non-working-age population to working-age population).

2. **Comparative Data**: According to Eurostat and other demographic studies, several European countries are experiencing significant aging trends. Countries like Germany, Italy, and Greece also have rapidly aging populations.

3. **Poland's Aging Rate**: Poland is indeed experiencing a rapid aging process due to low birth rates and increasing life expectancy. However, whether it is the fastest in Europe can be contested. For instance, countries like Germany and Italy have higher proportions of elderly people and have been dealing with aging issues for a longer period.

4. **Recent Studies and Projections**: Recent studies and projections from sources like Eurostat and the United Nations provide detailed comparisons. While Poland is among the countries with a rapidly aging population, it is not definitively the fastest.

Based on the available data, the claim that ""Polish society ages the fastest in Europe"" is an overstatement. Poland is one of the fastest-aging societies, but not necessarily the fastest.

Kazakhstan fell into the top 15 countries with the worst laws on access to information,true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Kazakhstan fell into the top 15 countries with the worst laws on access to information,"" we need to consult reliable sources that rank countries based on their access to information laws. One such source is the Global Right to Information Rating (RTI Rating), which assesses the strength of legal frameworks for access to information around the world.

As of the latest available data, Kazakhstan ranks relatively low on the RTI Rating, indicating that its laws on access to information are indeed weak. However, whether it specifically falls into the ""top 15 countries with the worst laws"" would require checking the most recent rankings and comparing Kazakhstan's position to other countries.

Given that Kazakhstan is known for having restrictive access to information laws, it is plausible that it could be among the worst, but without the exact ranking, we cannot definitively confirm the ""top 15"" part of the claim.

Poles are currently the most thoroughly disarmed nation in Europe.,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Poles are currently the most thoroughly disarmed nation in Europe,"" we need to consider the context of civilian gun ownership and the regulations surrounding it in Poland compared to other European countries.

Poland has some of the strictest gun control laws in Europe. Civilians must meet stringent requirements to own firearms, including passing psychological tests, having no criminal record, and demonstrating a valid reason for ownership, such as hunting or sport shooting. As a result, the rate of civilian gun ownership in Poland is relatively low compared to other European nations.

However, other countries in Europe also have strict gun control laws and low rates of civilian gun ownership. For example, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have very restrictive gun laws and similarly low levels of civilian gun ownership.

Given this context, while Poland is among the countries with the strictest gun control laws and lowest rates of civilian gun ownership, it is not definitively the ""most thoroughly disarmed"" nation in Europe, as other countries have comparable levels of disarmament.

""Changes in local authority boundaries shall not be made without prior consultation of the local communities concerned, possibly by means of a referendum where this is permitted by statute.""

This means that while the Charter emphasizes the need for consultation with local communities, it does not explicitly mandate a referendum. Instead, it suggests that a referendum is one possible method of consultation, where permitted by law.

Given this information, the claim that the solution is incompatible with the European Local Government Card because it requires a referendum for boundary changes is not entirely accurate. The Charter requires consultation, which may include a referendum, but does not strictly mandate it.

The salary in the national economy has increased in the last 2.5 years by 20%. It is an increase that has not been recorded earlier.,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main components:

1. **The salary in the national economy has increased in the last 2.5 years by 20%**: This part of the claim can be verified by looking at official economic data, such as reports from national statistical agencies or economic research institutions. If the data shows that the average salary has indeed increased by 20% over the specified period, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **It is an increase that has not been recorded earlier**: This part of the claim suggests that a 20% increase over 2.5 years is unprecedented. To verify this, we would need historical salary data to compare the current increase with past increases over similar periods. If no previous period shows a comparable or greater increase, this part of the claim would be true.

Without access to specific data, we can only hypothesize based on general economic trends. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data and no similar increase has been recorded in the past, the claim would be 'True'.

3. The current emigration rate of 50-60 thousand Poles per year.
4. The comparison between the two figures, specifically whether the current rate is indeed 8 times less.

First, let's consider the historical context. The Law and Justice party (PiS) has been in power in Poland during two main periods: 2005-2007 and from 2015 onwards. Emigration rates can vary significantly based on economic conditions, political climate, and other factors.

Second, the claim that 0.5 million Poles emigrated per year during PiS rule needs to be verified with reliable data sources such as government statistics or reputable research studies. Similarly, the current emigration rate of 50-60 thousand per year should be cross-checked with recent data.

Third, the mathematical comparison: if 0.5 million (500,000) emigrated per year previously and now 50-60 thousand (let's take an average of 55,000) emigrate per year, the reduction factor would be:

500,000 / 55,000 ≈ 9.09

This is close to 8 times, but slightly more.

Given the need for precise data to confirm these figures, and assuming the numbers provided are accurate, the claim appears to be mostly correct but slightly off in the exact reduction factor.

"Allowed to import vaccines without a national examination.Moreover, through organizations recommended by WHO.",half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Allowed to import vaccines without a national examination. Moreover, through organizations recommended by WHO,"" we need to consider the general practices and regulations surrounding vaccine importation and the role of the World Health Organization (WHO).

1. **National Examination**: Most countries have stringent regulations for the importation of vaccines, which typically include a national examination or approval process to ensure safety and efficacy. This process is usually conducted by national regulatory authorities (NRAs) such as the FDA in the United States or the EMA in the European Union. However, there are exceptions, especially during public health emergencies, where expedited or emergency use authorizations may be granted.

2. **WHO Recommendations**: The WHO does play a significant role in recommending vaccines, especially those prequalified by the organization. WHO prequalification is a service provided to assess the quality, safety, and efficacy of vaccines, which can facilitate their acceptance by countries with less stringent regulatory frameworks. However, even with WHO recommendations, most countries still require some form of national examination or approval.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat misleading. While WHO recommendations can influence national decisions and expedite processes, it is not accurate to say that vaccines can be imported without any national examination solely based on WHO recommendations.

"""I am the citizens of Serbia last (2009), before the beginning of the World Financial Crisis, said that it would be the most difficult in our newer history.""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. **Speaker**: The claim suggests that someone addressed the citizens of Serbia in 2009.
2. **Timing**: The statement was made before the beginning of the World Financial Crisis.
3. **Content**: The statement predicted that the upcoming period would be the most difficult in Serbia's newer history.

**Analysis**:

1. **Speaker**: It is not specified who made the statement. Without a specific individual, it's challenging to verify this part.
2. **Timing**: The World Financial Crisis, also known as the Global Financial Crisis, began in 2007-2008, not after 2009. Therefore, the timing mentioned in the claim is incorrect.
3. **Content**: Predicting economic difficulties is subjective and can vary based on interpretation. However, the claim about the timing being before the crisis is factually incorrect.

Given the incorrect timing and the lack of a specific speaker, the claim cannot be fully verified and contains significant inaccuracies.

"In China, the distribution of Solzhenitsyn's books has become a criminal offense",false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In China, the distribution of Solzhenitsyn's books has become a criminal offense,"" we need to consider the context of censorship and legal restrictions in China.

China is known for its strict control over information and literature, especially content that is politically sensitive or critical of the government. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a Russian author known for his works criticizing the Soviet Union, such as ""The Gulag Archipelago,"" could be considered politically sensitive material in China due to its themes of government oppression and human rights abuses.

While it is well-documented that China censors a wide range of foreign literature and media, specific information about the criminalization of distributing Solzhenitsyn's books is not readily available. However, given China's history of censorship and the nature of Solzhenitsyn's works, it is plausible that distributing his books could be restricted or lead to legal consequences.

Without concrete evidence or specific legal documentation stating that distributing Solzhenitsyn's books is explicitly a criminal offense in China, the claim cannot be fully verified. Therefore, the most accurate assessment based on available information would be:

"""We definitely await us for economic growth next (2010) years, but will not be five or seven percent as before, but more modest, one to one and per cent.""",true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the context and the specific details provided. The claim suggests that economic growth in the next few years (from 2010) will be more modest compared to previous years, specifically around one to one and a half percent, rather than five or seven percent.

1. **Historical Context**: Before 2010, many economies experienced significant growth rates, but the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 had a substantial impact on economic growth worldwide.
2. **Economic Projections**: Post-2008, many economic forecasts predicted slower growth rates as economies recovered from the recession. Growth rates of one to one and a half percent were considered modest compared to pre-crisis levels.
3. **Actual Growth Rates**: Reviewing actual economic growth rates from 2010 onwards for major economies like the US, EU, and others, we see that many did experience slower growth initially, though it varied by country and region.

Given this context, the claim that economic growth would be more modest in the years following 2010, specifically around one to one and a half percent, aligns with many economic forecasts and the actual slower recovery observed in several economies.

"""It's all the time (the number of cattle throat) went down a descending road, absolutely all the time.""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the statement: ""It's all the time (the number of cattle throat) went down a descending road, absolutely all the time.""

1. **Ambiguity and Clarity**: The phrase ""(the number of cattle throat)"" is unclear. It seems to be a mistranslation or typo. Assuming it means ""the number of cattle"" or ""the number of cattle slaughtered,"" we can proceed with the analysis.

2. **Temporal Consistency**: The statement claims that the number of cattle has ""absolutely all the time"" gone down a descending road. This implies a continuous and uninterrupted decline over an unspecified period.

3. **Historical Data**: Historically, the number of cattle can fluctuate due to various factors such as market demand, disease outbreaks, changes in farming practices, and economic conditions. It is unlikely that the number of cattle has continuously decreased without any periods of increase or stabilization.

Given these points, the claim that the number of cattle has ""absolutely all the time"" gone down is highly unlikely to be true without any exceptions.

Dean Koontz did write a novel titled ""The Eyes of Darkness"" in 1981, and in later editions of the book, there is a mention of a fictional virus called ""Wuhan-400."" However, the similarities between the fictional virus and the real coronavirus (COVID-19) are superficial and coincidental. The fictional virus in the book is a man-made biological weapon with a much higher mortality rate and different characteristics compared to the real coronavirus. Additionally, the name ""Ujan-400"" is incorrect; the book refers to ""Wuhan-400.""

Paweł Adamowicz (...) himself belonged to the party until the platform decided to part with him due to his problems with the law.,half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the context and details surrounding Paweł Adamowicz's relationship with his political party and any legal issues he may have faced.

Paweł Adamowicz was a prominent Polish politician and the Mayor of Gdańsk. He was a member of the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) party. However, in 2015, Adamowicz faced legal issues related to allegations of financial irregularities and discrepancies in his asset declarations. These legal troubles led to tensions within the party.

In 2018, the Civic Platform decided not to support Adamowicz's candidacy for another term as mayor, effectively parting ways with him. Adamowicz then ran as an independent candidate and won the election.

Given this context, the claim that Adamowicz ""belonged to the party until the platform decided to part with him due to his problems with the law"" is largely accurate but lacks some nuance. The party's decision not to support him was influenced by his legal issues, but he was not formally expelled from the party.

"""Italy, after Germany, the second foreign trade partner of Serbia, but the first export destination for our companies.""",true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Italy is the second foreign trade partner of Serbia after Germany.
2. Italy is the first export destination for Serbian companies.

Based on the most recent trade data available:

1. **Italy as the second foreign trade partner of Serbia**: According to trade statistics, Germany is indeed Serbia's largest trade partner. Italy is often cited as one of the top trade partners, typically ranking second or third. This part of the claim is generally accurate.

2. **Italy as the first export destination for Serbian companies**: Trade data shows that Italy is one of the top destinations for Serbian exports, often competing closely with Germany. However, Germany is frequently the largest export market for Serbia, with Italy being a close second.

Given this information, the claim that Italy is the second foreign trade partner of Serbia is accurate, but the assertion that Italy is the first export destination for Serbian companies is not entirely correct, as Germany usually holds that position.

This parliamentary majority and this authority is 94 percent of all irregularities and all what has pointed out the citizen protector.,mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the evidence and context surrounding it. The claim states that ""this parliamentary majority and this authority is 94 percent of all irregularities and all what has pointed out the citizen protector.""

1. **Parliamentary Majority and Authority**: This part of the claim suggests that a specific parliamentary majority and authority are responsible for a significant portion of irregularities.

2. **94 Percent of All Irregularities**: The claim quantifies the responsibility, attributing 94 percent of all irregularities to this parliamentary majority and authority.

3. **Citizen Protector's Findings**: The claim also references the findings of a ""citizen protector,"" implying that this figure or entity has identified these irregularities.

To verify this claim, we would need:
- Data or reports from the citizen protector that specifically attribute 94 percent of irregularities to the parliamentary majority and authority.
- Contextual information about the nature and scope of these irregularities.
- Independent verification or corroboration of these findings.

Without access to specific reports or data from the citizen protector, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible source and accurately represents the findings, it could be considered accurate. Conversely, if there is no such data or the claim misrepresents the findings, it would be false.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim itself, it is prudent to approach it with caution.

As of 2023, the minimum hourly rate in Poland is indeed PLN 17. In 2018, the minimum hourly rate was approximately PLN 13.70, not PLN 5. The claim that the rate was PLN 5 five years ago is incorrect.

"Unfortunately, it is [Polish administration] huge, over 400,000 people (...)",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the Polish administration consists of over 400,000 people, we need to look at reliable sources such as government reports, statistical data, or credible news articles that provide information on the size of the Polish public administration workforce.

According to data from the Polish Central Statistical Office (GUS) and other credible sources, the number of people employed in public administration, including government offices, local government units, and other public sector entities, is indeed substantial. As of recent years, the number of employees in the public administration sector in Poland has been reported to be in the range of several hundred thousand.

For instance, data from 2020 indicated that the number of employees in public administration, defense, and compulsory social security was around 600,000. This figure includes a broad range of public sector employees, not just those in administrative roles.

Given this context, the claim that the Polish administration consists of over 400,000 people is supported by available data.

"Even at the official price growth rate, only 7 months of households incur additional costs for products of 225 billion tenge",mostly true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the following components:

1. **Official Price Growth Rate**: This refers to the rate at which prices are officially reported to increase over a period.
2. **7 Months**: The time frame mentioned for the calculation.
3. **Households Incurring Additional Costs**: This implies that households are spending more due to the price growth.
4. **225 Billion Tenge**: The total additional cost incurred by households over the 7 months.

To verify the claim, we would need data on:
- The official price growth rate over the specified period.
- The average household expenditure on products.
- The number of households.
- The calculation method used to arrive at the 225 billion tenge figure.

Without specific data, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim. If the official price growth rate is applied uniformly over 7 months, and if the total additional cost for households is calculated correctly based on the number of households and their average expenditure, the claim could be plausible.

However, without concrete data to verify each component, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim. Therefore, the best we can do is to assess it as partially accurate based on logical consistency.

"""Serbia could become a 'European force' in the field of fisheries and fish processing by importing fish from the northern seas, and then reworked to sell Europeans.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim that ""Serbia could become a 'European force' in the field of fisheries and fish processing by importing fish from the northern seas, and then reworked to sell Europeans,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Geographical and Logistical Feasibility**: Serbia is a landlocked country, which means it does not have direct access to the sea. This would make the logistics of importing fish from the northern seas more complex and potentially more expensive compared to coastal countries.

2. **Existing Infrastructure**: Serbia would need significant investment in infrastructure for fish processing, including facilities, technology, and skilled labor. Currently, Serbia is not known for having a strong fish processing industry.

3. **Market Competition**: The European fish processing market is highly competitive, with established players in countries like Norway, Iceland, and other EU coastal nations. These countries have direct access to the northern seas and well-developed industries.

4. **Regulatory and Trade Barriers**: Serbia is not a member of the European Union, which could pose additional regulatory and trade barriers when trying to sell processed fish to EU countries.

Given these considerations, while it is theoretically possible for Serbia to develop a fish processing industry by importing fish, the claim that it could become a ""European force"" in this field seems overly optimistic and overlooks significant logistical, economic, and competitive challenges.

1. ""The results of the PISA indicate a decrease in literacy of schoolchildren.""
2. ""If in the countries of the OECD children constantly increase the results of reader literacy, then we have questions and a certain tendency to deterioration.""

**Part 1: PISA Results and Literacy Decrease**
The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study by the OECD that evaluates educational systems by measuring 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading. PISA results can vary by country and over time. Some countries may show a decrease in literacy, while others may show improvement or stability. Therefore, a blanket statement that PISA indicates a decrease in literacy of schoolchildren is not universally true but may be true for specific countries.

**Part 2: OECD Countries and Literacy Trends**
The claim that ""in the countries of the OECD children constantly increase the results of reader literacy"" is not entirely accurate. While some OECD countries may show improvements, others may experience stagnation or decline. The trends in literacy can vary significantly between different countries within the OECD.

Given these points, the claim is an oversimplification and does not accurately reflect the nuanced and varied results of PISA assessments across different countries.

1. **LSNS openly refers to the regime created by the Nazi collaborator, Fr. Tiso**: The LSNS (Ľudová strana Naše Slovensko or People's Party Our Slovakia) has been known to express admiration for Jozef Tiso, the president of the Slovak State during World War II, who collaborated with Nazi Germany.

2. **Calls for violence**: The LSNS has been associated with rhetoric that can be interpreted as inciting violence, particularly against minorities and political opponents. However, explicit calls for violence might not be a consistent or official stance of the party.

3. **Organizes militias**: The LSNS has been linked to the organization of paramilitary groups, such as the Slovak Conscripts, which have been involved in activities resembling militia training.

4. **Fascists got 8% of the votes**: In the 2016 Slovak parliamentary elections, the LSNS received around 8% of the vote, which allowed them to enter the National Council.

Given this information:

- The LSNS does have connections to the legacy of Jozef Tiso.

However, when considering the total number of doctors, larger countries like Germany, France, and Italy have higher absolute numbers, while smaller countries have fewer. The average number of doctors per 1,000 inhabitants in Europe is around 3.6, but this does not directly translate to an absolute number like 149,000 without considering population size.

Given that Poland's population is around 38 million, having approximately 149,000 doctors would place it in a reasonable range compared to other European countries of similar population size.

**Conclusion**:
The claim that Poland has 149,000 doctors and that this is around the European average is generally accurate, though the term ""European average"" can be somewhat ambiguous without specifying whether it refers to per capita or absolute numbers.

"As a UPR, we collected 140,000 signatures for the Act on the introduced death penalty.They were ""ground"" here in the Sejm.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **UPR (Union of Real Politics)**: This is a political party in Poland. We need to confirm if they indeed collected signatures for an act related to the death penalty.
2. **140,000 Signatures**: Verification is needed to see if this specific number of signatures was collected.
3. **Act on the Introduced Death Penalty**: We need to check if there was an act proposed by UPR regarding the death penalty.
4. **""Ground"" in the Sejm**: This implies that the act or proposal was dismissed or not taken forward in the Polish parliament (Sejm).

Given the historical context and the political processes in Poland, we can look at available records, news articles, and official statements to verify these points.

1. **UPR and Death Penalty**: The UPR has historically been known for its conservative and libertarian views, including support for the death penalty.
2. **Signature Collection**: There have been instances where political parties in Poland have collected signatures to propose legislation.
3. **140,000 Signatures**: This specific number needs to be verified through credible sources.
4. **Sejm's Response**: The Sejm's handling of such proposals can be checked through parliamentary records.

Without specific evidence or records confirming all these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general knowledge of UPR's activities and the legislative process in Poland, it is plausible but not confirmed.

"How many votes were invalid, now in the presidential election?1%?",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that 1% of the votes were invalid in the presidential election, we would need specific data from a reliable source regarding the number of invalid votes in the most recent presidential election. This data can vary significantly depending on the country and the specific election in question.

Without access to the specific data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we consider general trends, the percentage of invalid votes in elections can vary but often falls within a range that could include 1%. 

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate response would be to acknowledge the uncertainty.

"""Average salaries will move between 34,000 and 35,000 dinars this year, ie from 320 to 330 euros, which is at the region level.""",mostly false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The conversion rate between dinars and euros.
2. The average salaries in the region mentioned.

Let's break it down:

1. **Conversion Rate**: 
   - If 34,000 to 35,000 dinars is equivalent to 320 to 330 euros, we can calculate the implied exchange rate.
   - 34,000 dinars / 320 euros = 106.25 dinars per euro.
   - 35,000 dinars / 330 euros = 106.06 dinars per euro.
   - The exchange rate is approximately 106 dinars per euro.

2. **Regional Salary Comparison**:
   - The claim states that the average salary in the region is between 320 to 330 euros.
   - To verify this, we would need data on average salaries in the specific region being referred to.

Assuming the exchange rate is accurate and the regional salary data supports the range of 320 to 330 euros, the claim would be accurate. However, without specific regional salary data, we can only partially verify the claim.

Given the information provided and assuming the exchange rate is correct, the claim seems plausible but not fully verifiable without additional regional salary data.

"“... In the Soviet period, the fishing economy of Kazakhstan was one of the most highly developed profitable sectors of the national economy, the volume of gross fishing was over 80 thousand tons per year.Currently, the total volume of bioresourps production has decreased several times ... """,true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The fishing economy of Kazakhstan during the Soviet period was highly developed and profitable, with a gross fishing volume of over 80 thousand tons per year.
2. The current total volume of bioresources production has decreased several times compared to the Soviet period.

Historical data indicates that during the Soviet era, Kazakhstan indeed had a well-developed fishing industry, with significant production volumes. Reports and historical records support the claim that the fishing industry was a notable sector of the national economy, with production figures around the mentioned volume.

In recent years, various sources and reports indicate that Kazakhstan's fishing industry has faced challenges, including overfishing, environmental degradation, and economic shifts, leading to a significant reduction in fish production compared to the Soviet period.

Given the available information, the claim appears to be accurate.

"We are in a small group of Luxembourg, Belgium, Iceland and Greece, where these differences are smaller (in the pay of women and men).",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that Luxembourg, Belgium, Iceland, and Greece have smaller differences in the pay of women and men, we need to look at the gender pay gap statistics for these countries.

1. **Iceland**: Iceland is known for having one of the smallest gender pay gaps in the world. It has been a leader in gender equality and has implemented various measures to reduce the pay gap.

2. **Luxembourg**: Luxembourg also has a relatively small gender pay gap compared to many other countries. It has been making efforts to address gender inequality in the workplace.

3. **Belgium**: Belgium has a smaller gender pay gap compared to the EU average. The country has implemented policies to promote gender equality in the labor market.

4. **Greece**: Greece, on the other hand, has a larger gender pay gap compared to the other three countries mentioned. While it has made some progress, it still faces significant challenges in achieving gender pay equality.

Based on this information, the claim that these four countries have smaller differences in the pay of women and men is not entirely accurate, especially considering Greece's situation.

"""The number of"" false asylum seekers' who come from Serbia in the EU is in the fall. """,true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The number of false asylum seekers who come from Serbia in the EU is in the fall,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Data on Asylum Seekers**: We need to look at the statistics on asylum seekers from Serbia in the EU over recent years. This data is typically available from sources like Eurostat or national immigration agencies.

2. **Definition of 'False Asylum Seekers'**: The term ""false asylum seekers"" is not a standard term in migration studies. It could imply those whose claims are rejected, those who are deemed to be economic migrants rather than genuine refugees, or those who are found to have fraudulent claims.

3. **Trends Over Time**: We need to examine whether there has been a consistent decline in the number of asylum seekers from Serbia whose claims are rejected or deemed fraudulent.

Without specific data at hand, we can make a general assessment based on known trends and available reports. Historically, there have been fluctuations in the number of asylum seekers from Serbia, and the EU has taken measures to address unfounded claims. However, without precise and up-to-date statistics, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

Given the need for specific data to make a precise determination, and assuming that there has been some decline based on general trends and EU measures, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Sex loser threatens the corruption of the young generation and the destruction of the foundations of morality and decency,false,ru,"To evaluate the claim ""Sex loser threatens the corruption of the young generation and the destruction of the foundations of morality and decency,"" we need to break down the components and assess their validity based on available evidence and logical reasoning.

1. **Term Definition**: The term ""sex loser"" is not a standard term in sociological or psychological literature. It appears to be a pejorative or slang term, which makes it difficult to assess objectively without a clear definition.

2. **Corruption of the Young Generation**: The idea that certain behaviors or individuals can corrupt the young generation is a subjective claim. It depends on cultural, societal, and individual values. There is no empirical evidence that a specific group labeled as ""sex losers"" has a direct and measurable impact on the corruption of youth.

3. **Destruction of Morality and Decency**: Morality and decency are also subjective and culturally dependent concepts. The claim that a specific group or behavior can destroy these foundations is a broad generalization and lacks empirical support. Morality and decency evolve over time and are influenced by a multitude of factors, including education, family, media, and personal experiences.

Given the lack of clear definition, empirical evidence, and the subjective nature of the terms used in the claim, it is not possible to substantiate it as true.

"""What kind of policy is the SNS I find out most often of you journalists, what is the idea and ideology of the SNS does not have ... it doesn't even have a program.""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and content of the statement regarding the SNS (Serbian Progressive Party). The claim suggests that the SNS lacks a clear idea, ideology, and program.

1. **Idea and Ideology**: The SNS, like most political parties, has an ideological stance. It is generally considered a center-right party with a focus on pro-European Union policies, economic reforms, and anti-corruption measures. This indicates that the party does have an ideological framework.

2. **Program**: Political parties typically have programs or platforms that outline their policies and goals. The SNS has published programs and policy documents, especially during election periods, detailing their plans and objectives.

Given this information, the claim that the SNS ""does not have ... it doesn't even have a program"" is not accurate. The party does have an ideological stance and has published programs.

"According to Barcelon's goals, which PO agreed to implement, we should have 33% of guaranteed places for children in nurseries.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. Barcelon's goals include having 33% of guaranteed places for children in nurseries.
2. The PO (presumably a political organization or party) agreed to implement these goals.

Without specific information or context about Barcelon's goals and the commitments made by the PO, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on accurate information from reliable sources, we can make an educated guess.

Given the structure of the claim and the need for both parts to be accurate for the claim to be fully true, we can consider the following:

- If Barcelon's goals indeed include the 33% target and the PO has publicly agreed to implement these goals, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there is some ambiguity or partial fulfillment of these conditions, the claim might fall into 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

"The CJEU has the right and even is required to point out that our law is inconsistent with the Polish constitution, and thus, with EU law.",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the roles and responsibilities of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and its relationship with national laws and constitutions.

1. **CJEU's Role**: The CJEU interprets EU law to ensure it is applied uniformly across all EU member states. It can rule on whether national laws are consistent with EU law.

2. **National Constitutions**: The CJEU does not have the authority to directly interpret or rule on the consistency of national laws with national constitutions. That is the role of national constitutional courts.

3. **EU Law Supremacy**: EU law takes precedence over national law, including national constitutions, in areas where the EU has competence. If a national law, including a constitutional provision, conflicts with EU law, the CJEU can declare the national law incompatible with EU law.

4. **Polish Context**: In recent years, there have been tensions between the CJEU and Poland regarding the rule of law and judicial independence. The CJEU can rule that Polish laws are inconsistent with EU law, but it does not have the jurisdiction to declare them inconsistent with the Polish constitution.

Given these points, the claim that ""The CJEU has the right and even is required to point out that our law is inconsistent with the Polish constitution, and thus, with EU law"" is not accurate. The CJEU can point out inconsistencies with EU law but not directly with the Polish constitution.

"""The Serbian government adopted a decree on regression of mineral fertilizers, and the goal is to facilitate and help the farms successfully end this year's sowing of sowing.""",mostly false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Serbian government adopted a decree on regression of mineral fertilizers, and the goal is to facilitate and help the farms successfully end this year's sowing of sowing,"" we need to verify the following:

1. Whether the Serbian government has indeed adopted a decree related to mineral fertilizers.
2. The specific nature of the decree, particularly if it involves ""regression"" of mineral fertilizers.
3. The stated goal of the decree, which is to facilitate and help farms successfully complete this year's sowing.

Upon reviewing available information:

1. The Serbian government has been known to take measures to support agriculture, including subsidies and decrees related to agricultural inputs like fertilizers.
2. The term ""regression"" in the context of mineral fertilizers is unusual and may be a mistranslation or misinterpretation. It is more likely that the decree involves subsidies, price controls, or other forms of support rather than ""regression.""
3. The goal of such decrees typically aligns with supporting farmers to ensure successful sowing and agricultural productivity.

The second Budapest means much slower economic growth (...).They developed twice as slowly than we [Poland].,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The second Budapest means much slower economic growth (...). They developed twice as slowly than we [Poland],"" we need to examine the economic growth rates of Hungary (where Budapest is the capital) and Poland over a relevant period.

1. **Economic Growth Rates**: We need to compare the GDP growth rates of Hungary and Poland over a specific period. For instance, if we look at data from the World Bank or other reliable sources, we can see the annual GDP growth rates for both countries.

2. **Time Frame**: The claim does not specify a time frame, so we should consider a reasonable period, such as the last decade or the period since both countries joined the European Union in 2004.

3. **Context**: Economic growth can be influenced by various factors, including government policies, global economic conditions, and structural changes within the countries.

Let's consider the data from the World Bank for the period 2010-2020:

- **Poland**: Poland's average annual GDP growth rate during this period was approximately 3.6%.
- **Hungary**: Hungary's average annual GDP growth rate during the same period was approximately 2.5%.

Based on this data, Poland's economy grew faster than Hungary's, but not exactly ""twice as slowly."" The difference is significant but not as extreme as the claim suggests.

**Conclusion**: The claim that Hungary developed ""twice as slowly"" as Poland is an exaggeration. While Poland did experience faster economic growth, the difference is not as large as ""twice as slowly.""

"Since measles are very contagious, collective immunity does not work for it despite a very high vaccination coverage",false,ru,"To evaluate the claim, we need to understand the concept of herd immunity (collective immunity) and how it applies to measles.

Herd immunity occurs when a high enough proportion of the population is immune to a disease (through vaccination or previous infection), making its spread unlikely. This provides indirect protection to those who are not immune.

Measles is indeed highly contagious, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 12-18, meaning one infected person can spread the disease to 12-18 others in a susceptible population. Because of this high R0, a very high level of vaccination coverage is required to achieve herd immunity. The threshold for measles is around 95%.

When vaccination coverage is very high (around 95% or more), herd immunity can and does work for measles. This has been demonstrated in many countries where high vaccination rates have led to the elimination or significant reduction of measles cases.

Therefore, the claim that ""collective immunity does not work for it despite a very high vaccination coverage"" is incorrect. High vaccination coverage does lead to herd immunity for measles.

The statement suggests that there can be no Secretary of State who would cause problems in coalition relations, specifically mentioning Slobodan Ilić.

1. **Existence of a Secretary of State**: The title ""Secretary of State"" is used in various countries, but its role and significance can vary. In some countries, this position might not exist or might be called something else.

2. **Slobodan Ilić**: The statement specifically names Slobodan Ilić. To verify the claim, we need to check if Slobodan Ilić has held a position equivalent to Secretary of State and if he has been involved in causing problems within a coalition.

3. **Coalition Relations**: The claim implies that Slobodan Ilić, if he were Secretary of State, would not cause problems in coalition relations. This is a subjective assessment and would require specific historical or political context to verify.

Given the lack of specific context and verifiable information about Slobodan Ilić's role and actions, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general nature of political roles and the potential for any individual to cause issues in coalition relations, the statement appears speculative.

"The fact that epidemiologists did not believe in the seasonality of coronavirus led to the compilation of incorrect models and forecasts.When the initial worst scenarios have not come true anywhere, some still cling to the models that predict the second wave.",false,ru,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its components and assess each part based on available evidence and expert consensus.

1. **Seasonality of Coronavirus**: Early in the pandemic, there was uncertainty about the seasonality of COVID-19. Some epidemiologists did not initially believe that COVID-19 would exhibit strong seasonality like influenza. However, over time, evidence has shown that while there may be some seasonal effects, COVID-19 can spread in all seasons.

2. **Incorrect Models and Forecasts**: Epidemiological models are based on the best available data and assumptions at the time. Early models often had a wide range of outcomes due to uncertainties about the virus's behavior, transmission rates, and public health responses. Some models did overestimate the impact, but this was partly due to the lack of data and the need to prepare for worst-case scenarios.

3. **Initial Worst Scenarios**: Many of the worst-case scenarios did not come true, partly because of effective public health interventions like lockdowns, social distancing, and mask-wearing. However, this does not mean the models were entirely incorrect; they helped guide policy decisions that mitigated the impact.

4. **Second Wave Predictions**: The prediction of a second wave was based on historical patterns of pandemics and the understanding that without continued public health measures, the virus could resurge. Indeed, many regions experienced subsequent waves of COVID-19 infections.

Given this analysis:

- The claim that epidemiologists did not believe in seasonality is somewhat accurate but oversimplified.
- The assertion that this led to incorrect models is partially true, but models are inherently uncertain and were based on the best available data.
- The statement about initial worst scenarios not coming true is true in many cases, but this was due to effective interventions.
- The idea that some still cling to second wave predictions is true, and these predictions were validated by subsequent waves in many areas.

The claim suggests that there is a presumption of consent for organ donation unless an individual explicitly opts out or their relatives express disagreement.

This system is known as ""opt-out"" or ""presumed consent"" for organ donation. Many countries have adopted this approach to increase the number of available organs for transplantation. In an opt-out system, individuals are considered potential organ donors unless they have registered their decision not to donate.

However, the claim also states that ""the people were against it,"" which is a subjective statement and may vary depending on the country and the specific public opinion at the time of implementation.

Given that the claim accurately describes the concept of presumed consent for organ donation but includes a subjective statement about public opinion, the most appropriate classification would be:

"""The Kragujevac-Batocino Highway is one of the government's priorities, primarily due to the contract with Fiat.""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Kragujevac-Batocino Highway is one of the government's priorities, primarily due to the contract with Fiat,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Government Priorities**: Whether the Kragujevac-Batocino Highway is indeed listed as a priority by the government.
2. **Fiat Contract**: The significance of the contract with Fiat and its influence on the prioritization of the highway.

### Analysis:

1. **Government Priorities**:
   - If the government has officially listed the Kragujevac-Batocino Highway as a priority in their infrastructure plans, this part of the claim would be true.
   - Verification would require checking government announcements, infrastructure plans, or official statements.

2. **Fiat Contract**:
   - Fiat has a significant manufacturing presence in Kragujevac, Serbia, which could influence infrastructure decisions to support industrial and economic activities.
   - If the contract with Fiat is a major reason cited by the government for prioritizing this highway, this part of the claim would also be true.

### Conclusion:
Without specific evidence from government documents or official statements, it is challenging to definitively confirm both parts of the claim. However, given the known presence of Fiat in Kragujevac and the potential economic benefits of improved infrastructure, it is plausible that the highway could be a priority partly due to the Fiat contract.

1. ""The Polish black box was listened to in Poland"" - This implies that the data from the black box was analyzed or reviewed in Poland.
2. ""brought to Poland"" - This means the physical black box was transported to Poland.
3. ""is in Polish hands"" - This suggests that the black box is currently under the control of Polish authorities.

Without specific context or additional information about the incident or black box in question, it is challenging to verify each part of the claim. However, if we assume the statement refers to a well-documented event, such as the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash, we can provide a more informed analysis.

For the 2010 crash:
- The black boxes were initially analyzed in Russia.
- Copies of the recordings were provided to Poland.
- The original black boxes remained in Russia for a significant period.

Given this context, the claim would be:

1. ""The Polish black box was listened to in Poland"" - Partially true, as copies were analyzed in Poland.
2. ""brought to Poland"" - False, as the original black boxes were not brought to Poland.
3. ""is in Polish hands"" - False, as the original black boxes remained in Russia.

"Each Kazakhstani - from the old man to the baby - should already be a foreign ""uncle"" about 9 thousand dollars.",half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Each Kazakhstani - from the old man to the baby - should already be a foreign 'uncle' about 9 thousand dollars,"" we need to examine Kazakhstan's external debt and its per capita distribution.

1. **Kazakhstan's External Debt**: According to the National Bank of Kazakhstan, as of recent data, the country's external debt is substantial, often reported in the range of tens of billions of dollars.

2. **Population**: Kazakhstan's population is approximately 19 million people.

3. **Per Capita Debt Calculation**: If we take an external debt figure, for example, $160 billion (a rough estimate based on recent data), and divide it by the population (19 million), we get:
   \[
   \frac{160,000,000,000}{19,000,000} \approx 8,421
   \]
   This calculation gives us a per capita external debt of approximately $8,421, which is close to the $9,000 mentioned in the claim.

Given this information, the claim that each Kazakhstani owes about $9,000 in foreign debt is fairly accurate, though not exact.

In Poland, priests and other clergy members can opt for a flat-rate tax system, which is different from the standard PIT system. The flat-rate tax amount can vary based on several factors, including the size of the parish and the type of religious service. However, a commonly cited figure for the flat-rate tax for priests is around PLN 243 quarterly.

### Step 2: Verify the average PIT for taxpayers
The average PIT paid by taxpayers can vary widely based on income levels, deductions, and other factors. However, for the sake of this comparison, we need an average figure. According to various sources, the average quarterly PIT payment for a typical taxpayer in Poland can be around PLN 2500.

### Conclusion
Given the information available, the claim that priests pay PLN 243 of the flat-rate tax quarterly and the average taxpayer pays PLN 2500 quarterly of PIT appears to be accurate.

"""So we can't just return pensions as the IMF is looking for, and as some people are looking for, to the previous level.Because that would mean that for 80 percent of retirees you reduce pensions.(...) So, we can't just say 'that law is abolished', because we will not reduce pensions to anyone. """,false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify its components:

1. **Context of IMF and Pension Levels**: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) often recommends fiscal policies, including adjustments to pension systems, to ensure economic stability and sustainability. If the IMF is suggesting a return to previous pension levels, it implies that current pension levels are higher than before.

2. **Impact on Retirees**: The claim states that returning pensions to previous levels would reduce pensions for 80 percent of retirees. This suggests that the majority of retirees are currently receiving higher pensions than they did at the previous level.

3. **Legislative Action**: The statement also mentions that abolishing a certain law would result in not reducing pensions for anyone, implying that the current law maintains higher pension levels.

To verify the claim, we would need specific data on:
- The IMF's recommendations regarding pension levels.
- The current and previous pension levels.
- The proportion of retirees affected by any changes in pension levels.

Assuming the context provided is accurate and the data supports the claim that 80 percent of retirees would see a reduction if pensions were returned to previous levels, the statement would be accurate.

Zoom online conferences program is unsafe,half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Zoom online conferences program is unsafe,"" we need to consider various factors, including the history of security issues, the measures taken by Zoom to address them, and the current state of the platform.

1. **History of Security Issues**: 
   - In early 2020, Zoom faced significant scrutiny over security and privacy issues, such as ""Zoombombing"" (uninvited guests crashing meetings), lack of end-to-end encryption, and data routing through China.

2. **Measures Taken by Zoom**:
   - Since then, Zoom has implemented numerous security enhancements. These include:
     - End-to-end encryption for all users.
     - Enhanced meeting controls to prevent Zoombombing.
     - Regular security updates and patches.
     - Transparency reports and third-party audits.

3. **Current State**:
   - As of now, Zoom is considered to be much more secure than it was in early 2020. It is widely used by businesses, educational institutions, and governments, which suggests a level of trust in its security measures.

Given this context, the claim that ""Zoom online conferences program is unsafe"" is not entirely accurate. While it had significant issues in the past, the company has made substantial improvements to address these concerns.

Italians massively accept Islam,false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Italians massively accept Islam,"" we need to consider available data and context regarding religious demographics and trends in Italy.

1. **Demographics**: Italy is predominantly a Roman Catholic country. According to various sources, including the Pew Research Center, the majority of Italians identify as Roman Catholic. The Muslim population in Italy is a minority, estimated to be around 4-5% of the total population.

2. **Conversion Trends**: There is no substantial evidence or data indicating a massive conversion of Italians to Islam. While there are individual cases of conversion, these do not constitute a significant trend that would support the claim of massive acceptance.

3. **Public Opinion**: Surveys and studies on public opinion in Italy often show mixed feelings towards Islam and Muslims, with some segments of the population expressing concerns or negative sentiments, particularly in the context of immigration and integration.

Given the above points, the claim that ""Italians massively accept Islam"" does not align with the available data and context.

"The ""average salary in January was first in Serbia over 460 euros, 462 euros, ie in January, we expect in March, it is 40 percent more than what I found as the Prime Minister in 2014.",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The average salary in Serbia in January was over 460 euros, specifically 462 euros.
2. The claim that this is 40 percent more than the average salary when the speaker became Prime Minister in 2014.

First, let's check the average salary in Serbia in January. According to the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia, the average net salary in January 2023 was around 462 euros.

Next, we need to verify the average salary in 2014. In 2014, the average net salary in Serbia was approximately 330 euros.

To calculate the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{462 - 330}{330} \right) \times 100 \approx 40\% \]

Both points in the claim are accurate. Therefore, the claim is 'True'.

""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and the specifics of gender equality bodies in governments across Europe, including both the Western Balkans and the European Union (EU).

1. **Context of the Claim**: The claim suggests that a particular government has raised gender equality to a higher level than any other government in Europe by establishing a body for gender equality directly under the Prime Minister.

2. **Comparison with Other Governments**:
   - **Western Balkans**: Countries in the Western Balkans have varying levels of commitment to gender equality, but it is less common to have a dedicated body for gender equality directly under the Prime Minister.
   - **European Union**: Within the EU, several countries have strong institutional frameworks for gender equality. For example, Sweden has a Minister for Gender Equality, and other countries have similar high-level positions or bodies dedicated to gender equality. However, the specific structure and placement of these bodies can vary.

3. **Unique Positioning**: The claim emphasizes the uniqueness of having a gender equality body directly under the Prime Minister, which may not be a common practice even in countries with strong gender equality frameworks.

Given the information, the claim appears to be somewhat exaggerated but not entirely without basis. It is plausible that the specific structure mentioned is less common, but it is not entirely unique across Europe.

2. ""by JP' Ski Resort of Serbia"" - This specifies that the crashes were associated with JP' Ski Resort of Serbia. Verification is needed to confirm this association.

3. ""a large and selfless support of the management of JP' Ski Resort of Serbia towards us was proved to this latest donation"" - This part claims that the management of JP' Ski Resort of Serbia provided significant and selfless support, evidenced by a recent donation. Verification of the donation and the nature of the support is required.

1. ""Subsidies to individual companies are falling, but still there are.""

   - This specifies that the city traffic company is still receiving subsidies.

3. ""Also, procurement of new buses, all the measures of the savings we started, and the company slowly stands on its feet.""

Ryszard Petru is a Polish economist and politician who founded the political party Nowoczesna (Modern) in 2015. In the 2015 Polish parliamentary elections, Nowoczesna received 7.6% of the vote, securing 28 seats in the Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament).

The United Left (Zjednoczona Lewica) was a coalition of left-wing parties that also participated in the 2015 elections. However, the United Left received 7.6% of the vote but failed to cross the 8% threshold required for coalitions to enter the Sejm, thus securing no seats.

1. If the airport currently brings in 27 million euros, this would need to be verified by current financial reports or statements from the airport's management.
2. The claim that the president mentioned 130,000 euros in profits before coming to power would need to be cross-checked with historical financial records or public statements.
3. The assertion that there was never a time when profits were below 16-17 million euros contradicts the earlier statement of 130,000 euros in profits, suggesting a possible misstatement or correction by the president.

And there is an opportunity to use psychiatry for punitive purposes).",half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the specific points made:

1. **Blurry Criteria for Psychiatric Diagnoses**: The claim suggests that psychiatric diagnoses are based on vague or unclear criteria. In reality, psychiatric diagnoses are typically based on established criteria found in diagnostic manuals such as the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) or the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases). These criteria are developed through extensive research and clinical consensus, although some subjectivity can be involved in their application.

2. **Removal of Specific Diagnostic Language**: The claim states that the words “in accordance with clinical manifestations, laboratory data, objective information” were removed. This would imply a significant change in diagnostic standards. However, there is no widespread evidence or documentation to support that such a change has been universally implemented in psychiatric practice.

3. **Potential for Misuse**: The claim suggests that the changes allow for the misuse of psychiatry for punitive purposes. While it is true that psychiatric diagnoses can be misused in some contexts (e.g., political abuse of psychiatry), this is not a reflection of standard psychiatric practice but rather an abuse of the system.

Given the lack of concrete evidence supporting the removal of specific diagnostic language and the established nature of psychiatric diagnostic criteria, the claim appears to be exaggerated and not fully accurate.

1. ""As you can see even the dinars we did not spend on the campaign"" - This implies that no money was spent on the campaign. Verification would require financial records or statements from the campaign.

2. ""we have no sets"" - This suggests that no physical sets or stages were used. Verification would require evidence of campaign events or lack thereof.

1. **Global Context**: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is a significant health risk and is responsible for millions of premature deaths globally each year. The number 40,000 is much lower than the global figures, suggesting that the claim might be referring to a specific region or country.

2. **UK Context**: In the UK, the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health published a report in 2016 estimating that around 40,000 deaths a year in the UK are attributable to outdoor air pollution. This figure has been widely cited in discussions about air quality and public health in the UK.

3. **Other Countries**: For other countries, the number of premature deaths due to pollution can vary significantly. For instance, countries with higher pollution levels like India and China report much higher numbers of premature deaths due to pollution.

Given that the claim does not specify a region, it is reasonable to assume it might be referring to a well-documented case like the UK. Therefore, the claim is accurate in the context of the UK but not globally.

"There was a ban on abortion for Hitler, and there was a ban on abortion.",half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the historical context and the policies of Nazi Germany regarding abortion.

Under Adolf Hitler's regime, the Nazi government implemented strict policies on abortion that were racially motivated. For Aryan women, abortion was heavily restricted and discouraged, as the regime aimed to increase the birth rate of those considered racially ""pure."" However, for women deemed ""undesirable"" or belonging to groups the Nazis sought to eliminate (such as Jews, Romani people, and those with disabilities), abortion and even forced sterilization were often encouraged or mandated.

Given this context, the claim that ""There was a ban on abortion for Hitler, and there was a ban on abortion"" is somewhat misleading. It is true that there was a ban on abortion for certain groups (primarily Aryan women), but it is not accurate to say there was a universal ban on abortion under Hitler's regime.

"""The dinar is among the most stable currencies, not only in the region, but in Europe.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim that ""The dinar is among the most stable currencies, not only in the region, but in Europe,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Currency Stability**: Currency stability is typically measured by its exchange rate volatility, inflation rate, and economic policies of the issuing country.

2. **Regional Context**: The region in question is not specified, but if we assume it refers to the Middle East or North Africa, we need to compare the dinar to other regional currencies.

3. **European Context**: Comparing the dinar to European currencies, particularly the Euro, which is known for its stability, is crucial.

4. **Specific Dinar**: There are several currencies named dinar, including the Kuwaiti dinar, Jordanian dinar, and Algerian dinar, among others. The Kuwaiti dinar, for example, is known for its stability and high value.

Given these points:

- **Kuwaiti Dinar**: Known for its stability and high value, often considered one of the most stable currencies globally.
- **Other Dinars**: The stability of other dinars (e.g., Jordanian, Algerian) varies and may not be as high as the Kuwaiti dinar.

Considering the general statement without specifying which dinar, and comparing it to European currencies, the claim seems to be an overgeneralization. While the Kuwaiti dinar is very stable, other dinars may not be as stable, and European currencies like the Euro are also highly stable.

These reports typically outline the reasons for the change, which can include factors such as public finances, economic performance, political stability, and external economic conditions.

2. **Public Finances**: If the previous government had issues such as high deficits, increasing debt levels, or poor fiscal management, these could indeed contribute to a downgrade in the credit rating.

"""Somewhere between 2007 and 2011, there was a great stalemate in the investigation and did not really deal with these cases.",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and specific details of the investigation being referred to. The statement suggests that there was a significant period of inactivity or lack of progress in an investigation between 2007 and 2011. 

Without specific details about which investigation is being referenced, it is challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, if we assume the statement is referring to a well-known investigation that experienced documented delays or stalemates during that period, we could evaluate its accuracy based on historical records and reports.

For example, if the statement refers to the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, it is known that there were periods of limited progress and significant challenges faced by investigators during those years. However, this would need to be confirmed with specific details and sources.

Given the general nature of the statement and the lack of specific context provided, it is difficult to categorically determine its truthfulness. Therefore, the most appropriate response based on the available information would be:

Garbage ended in Sweden,false,ru,"Final Answer: False

The claim that ""Garbage ended in Sweden"" is false. Sweden is known for its highly efficient waste management and recycling systems, and it has significantly reduced the amount of waste that goes to landfills. However, it is not accurate to say that garbage has ended in Sweden. The country still produces waste, but it manages it through recycling, composting, and waste-to-energy processes.",,False,True
"The share of food costs in Kazakhstan is almost half of the budget for almost 50% of citizens, which is much worse than in neighboring Russia, not to mention developed countries, where food costs are only 10-12%",true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The share of food costs in Kazakhstan is almost half of the budget for almost 50% of citizens.
2. The share of food costs in neighboring Russia is significantly lower.
3. In developed countries, food costs are only 10-12%.

### Verification:

1. **Kazakhstan's Food Costs:**
   - According to various reports and data from sources like the World Bank and local statistics agencies, a significant portion of the population in Kazakhstan does spend a large share of their income on food. Some estimates suggest that for lower-income households, food can indeed take up a substantial portion of the budget, sometimes approaching 50%.

2. **Russia's Food Costs:**
   - In Russia, the share of household budgets spent on food is generally lower than in Kazakhstan but still higher than in many developed countries. Estimates suggest it is around 30-35% for lower-income households.

3. **Developed Countries' Food Costs:**
   - In developed countries, the share of household budgets spent on food is indeed much lower, typically around 10-12%, as stated. This is supported by data from the OECD and other economic studies.

### Conclusion:
The claim that the share of food costs in Kazakhstan is almost half of the budget for almost 50% of citizens is supported by available data. The comparison to Russia and developed countries also holds true based on the general trends in household spending.

""",true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Financial Performance of Public Utility Companies**: The claim states that the city public utility companies in Belgrade operated with a loss of two billion dinars in 2013 and now make a profit of two billion dinars. This requires access to financial records or credible reports from the public utility companies for the years in question.

2. **Allocation of Profits**: The claim asserts that 85 percent of the profit goes into the budget of the city of Belgrade. This would need to be confirmed by examining the city's budgetary policies and financial statements.

"The USA bought up 90% of the reserve of the drug ""Remesivir""",true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The USA bought up 90% of the reserve of the drug 'Remesivir',"" we need to look at the context and details surrounding the purchase of Remdesivir (note the correct spelling of the drug).

In mid-2020, the U.S. government did indeed secure a significant portion of the global supply of Remdesivir, an antiviral drug used to treat COVID-19. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it had secured more than 500,000 treatment courses of Remdesivir from the drug's manufacturer, Gilead Sciences. This represented 100% of Gilead's projected production for July 2020, and 90% of production for August and September 2020.

Given this information, the claim that the USA bought up 90% of the reserve of Remdesivir is accurate for the specified period of August and September 2020.

2. The total amount of debt attributed to these pensioners.

Without access to the most recent and specific data from the National Debt Register of Poland, it is challenging to confirm the exact figures. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent and accurate data, we can analyze the structure and plausibility of the statement.

The claim states:
- There are 366 thousand Polish pensioners in the National Debt Register.
- They are indebted to PLN 5.7 billion.

Given the specificity of the numbers, it suggests that the claim is based on some form of data or report. However, without direct verification from a reliable source, we cannot confirm the exact accuracy.

Based on the structure and the specificity of the claim, it seems plausible but not verifiable with the information at hand.

2. **Comparison with Other Non-EU Countries**: The claim also states that Serbia is among the first three countries outside the European Union to start vaccination. We need to verify if Serbia was indeed one of the first three non-EU countries to begin vaccination.

### Verification:

1. **Timing of Serbia's Vaccination Start**:
   - Serbia began its COVID-19 vaccination campaign on December 24, 2020. This is not early December but rather late December.

2. **Comparison with Other Non-EU Countries**:
   - Several non-EU countries, including the United Kingdom (which had left the EU by then), Russia, and the United States, started their vaccination campaigns before Serbia. The UK began on December 8, 2020, Russia on December 5, 2020, and the US on December 14, 2020.

"""Maintaining extraordinary parliamentary elections would not expire the parliamentary election cycle, because it is just another printed slip to be rounded.""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and understand the context of parliamentary elections and their cycles.

1. **Extraordinary Parliamentary Elections**: These are elections that are held outside the regular schedule, often due to a specific triggering event such as a vote of no confidence, dissolution of parliament, or other significant political events.

2. **Parliamentary Election Cycle**: This refers to the regular, scheduled intervals at which parliamentary elections are held, typically every few years depending on the country's laws.

3. **Impact on Election Cycle**: The claim suggests that holding extraordinary elections does not affect the regular election cycle, implying that the next scheduled election would still occur as planned.

Given this context, the claim can be evaluated as follows:

- **True**: If extraordinary elections do not reset or alter the regular election schedule, then the claim is accurate.
- **False**: If extraordinary elections do reset or alter the regular election schedule, then the claim is inaccurate.

In many parliamentary systems, extraordinary elections do not reset the regular election cycle. The next regular election would still occur as originally scheduled unless specific laws or regulations state otherwise.

1. **Stanisław Tyszka's Political Alignment**: Whether Stanisław Tyszka is indeed anti-PiS (Law and Justice Party) and if he is known for his radicalism.
2. **Stanisław Tyszka's Association with Jarosław Gowin**: Whether Tyszka has been a close advisor to Jarosław Gowin and a member of the board of the Polish Together Party (Polska Razem), which is associated with Gowin.

### Analysis:

1. **Stanisław Tyszka's Political Alignment**:
   - Stanisław Tyszka is a member of the Kukiz'15 movement, which has had a complex relationship with PiS. While Kukiz'15 has cooperated with PiS on certain issues, it has also been critical of PiS policies. Tyszka himself has been vocal in his criticism of PiS, which could be interpreted as being anti-PiS.
   - The term ""radicalism"" is subjective and would depend on the context of his actions and statements. However, Tyszka is known for his strong and sometimes controversial positions.

2. **Stanisław Tyszka's Association with Jarosław Gowin**:
   - There is no widely available evidence to suggest that Stanisław Tyszka has been a close advisor to Jarosław Gowin or a member of the board of the Polish Together Party. Tyszka's political career is more closely associated with Kukiz'15 rather than Gowin's political endeavors.

### Conclusion:
The claim that Stanisław Tyszka is anti-PiS and radical can be considered partially true based on his critical stance towards PiS. However, the assertion that he is a close advisor to Jarosław Gowin and a member of the board of the Polish Together Party does not hold up to scrutiny.

Feminitivians are necessary for language and society,true,ru,"To evaluate the claim ""Feminitivians are necessary for language and society,"" we need to consider the role and impact of feminitivians (gender-specific language forms) in both linguistic and societal contexts.

1. **Linguistic Perspective**:
   - **Inclusivity**: Feminitivians can promote gender inclusivity by recognizing and validating the presence of different genders in language. This can be particularly important in languages with strong gender distinctions.
   - **Clarity**: They can provide clarity in communication by specifying gender, which can be relevant in certain contexts.

2. **Societal Perspective**:
   - **Equality and Representation**: Using feminitivians can contribute to gender equality and representation, making women and non-binary individuals more visible in language and, by extension, in society.
   - **Cultural Sensitivity**: In some cultures, the use of gender-specific language forms is deeply rooted and can be seen as a way to respect and acknowledge gender differences.

However, the necessity of feminitivians can be debated:
   - **Language Evolution**: Languages evolve, and some argue that gender-neutral language can achieve inclusivity without the need for feminitivians.
   - **Practicality**: In some languages, the introduction of feminitivians can complicate grammar and usage, leading to resistance or confusion.

Given these points, the claim that feminitivians are ""necessary"" for language and society is not universally accepted and can vary based on cultural, linguistic, and individual perspectives.

1. **George W. Bush's Visit to Wawel Castle**: George W. Bush did visit Wawel Castle during his presidency. He visited Poland in 2001 and 2003, and during these visits, he did make public appearances and speeches.

2. **Other Notable Figures**: Wawel Castle is a historic site in Poland and has hosted numerous important events and figures over the centuries. It is unlikely that George W. Bush was the only notable figure to have ever spoken there.

3. **Verification of the Claim**: A thorough check of historical records and notable events at Wawel Castle would show that many other dignitaries, including Polish leaders and foreign dignitaries, have spoken there.

Given the historical significance of Wawel Castle and the numerous events it has hosted, it is highly improbable that George W. Bush was the only person to have spoken there.

"""The number of retirees in Serbia will grow in the coming years, and the number of new jobs will not follow such a fast increase in the number of pensioners.""",true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider demographic trends, economic forecasts, and labor market data specific to Serbia.

1. **Demographic Trends**: Serbia, like many other countries, is experiencing an aging population. The fertility rate is low, and life expectancy is increasing, which means the proportion of retirees is expected to grow.

2. **Economic Forecasts**: Economic growth and job creation rates are influenced by various factors, including government policies, foreign investments, and global economic conditions. However, creating new jobs at a rate that matches or exceeds the increase in retirees can be challenging, especially in an aging society.

3. **Labor Market Data**: Historical data and projections from institutions like the Serbian Statistical Office or international organizations (e.g., World Bank, IMF) can provide insights into job creation trends and workforce participation rates.

Given these points, the claim that the number of retirees will grow and the number of new jobs will not follow such a fast increase is supported by demographic and economic trends. However, without specific numerical data or projections, the claim cannot be verified with absolute certainty.

"""The biggest inflow of investments in Serbia was while DSS led the government, and citizens could do so well, because the average salary was higher for the table as much as it was higher than today.""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the biggest inflow of investments in Serbia occurred while the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) led the government.
2. Whether the average salary was higher during that period compared to today.

1. **Inflow of Investments:**
   - The DSS led the Serbian government from 2004 to 2008. During this period, Serbia did experience significant foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in the years following the assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić in 2003, which led to political stabilization and economic reforms.
   - However, to claim it was the ""biggest"" inflow, we need to compare it with other periods, especially recent years. Serbia has seen substantial investments in the 2010s and early 2020s, particularly in sectors like automotive, IT, and manufacturing.

2. **Average Salary:**
   - The average salary in Serbia has generally been on an upward trend over the years, adjusting for inflation and economic growth. Data from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia would show the average salary figures for the period when DSS was in power and compare them to current figures.
   - As of recent years, the average salary in Serbia has continued to increase, reflecting economic growth and inflation adjustments.

Given these points, the claim that the biggest inflow of investments was during the DSS government is debatable and likely not accurate when considering recent investment trends. Additionally, the assertion about average salaries being higher during the DSS period compared to today is also questionable, as average salaries have generally increased over time.

The claim states:
1. ""51.1 percent of PIO fund went for paying pensions earlier, while it is now 62.2 percent.""
2. ""Only 37.8 percent from the budget.""

To verify this, we would need:
- Historical data showing that 51.1% of the PIO (Public Investment Organization) fund was previously allocated to pensions.
- Current data showing that 62.2% of the PIO fund is now allocated to pensions.
- Confirmation that the remaining 37.8% of the budget is allocated to other expenses.

Without access to the specific data or reports from the PIO fund, it is challenging to definitively verify the percentages mentioned in the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and there are no other conflicting sources, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific data to either confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate classification would be based on the assumption that the provided figures are correct.

"""Salaries of health workers are in the rank of auxiliary workers in public enterprises.""",true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Salaries of health workers are in the rank of auxiliary workers in public enterprises,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Definition of Health Workers**: Health workers include a wide range of professionals such as doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and support staff.

2. **Definition of Auxiliary Workers**: Auxiliary workers typically refer to support staff who assist in various functions but do not hold primary professional roles. This can include administrative staff, maintenance workers, and other support roles.

3. **Salary Comparisons**: Generally, health workers, especially those with professional qualifications like doctors and nurses, tend to have higher salaries compared to auxiliary workers in public enterprises. This is due to the specialized skills, education, and responsibilities required in healthcare roles.

4. **Public Enterprises**: Public enterprises can vary widely in terms of the types of auxiliary workers they employ and their salary scales. However, it is uncommon for professional health workers to be classified or compensated at the same level as auxiliary workers.

Given these points, the claim that ""Salaries of health workers are in the rank of auxiliary workers in public enterprises"" is not accurate for the majority of health workers, especially those with professional qualifications.

2. ""Poland does not have this tree (...), and such a distinction happened to Denmark.""

1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim suggests that the budget was reopened in October 2012, and the last time it was reopened in October was in 2006.

2. **Historical Context**: We need to check if the budget was indeed reopened in October 2012 and if the previous instance of an October reopening was in 2006.

3. **Verification**:

The European Commission regularly publishes progress reports on candidate countries, including Serbia, as part of the EU enlargement process. These reports typically assess the progress made by the country in various areas, including political and economic reforms, and often include recommendations for future actions.

However, the specific characterization of the report as ""positive"" can be subjective. Reports usually contain both positive and critical assessments. The term ""menu for next year"" is not a standard phrase used in official reports, but it could be interpreted as a set of recommendations or a roadmap for future reforms.

2. **Data**: Gas prices can fluctuate based on various factors such as taxes, subsidies, and market conditions. Recent data from sources like Eurostat or other energy market reports would be necessary to make an accurate comparison.

As of the latest available data, Poland's gas prices are generally higher than some neighboring countries but not necessarily the highest in the region. Countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark often have higher gas prices due to different tax structures and market conditions.

1. **""Increase in the order of 20 thousand thousand, almost 30 thousand [children] a year""**:
   - ""20 thousand thousand"" translates to 20 million. However, the statement then says ""almost 30 thousand,"" which is a significant discrepancy. It seems there might be a confusion or error in the numbers presented.

2. **""Thanks to the Family 500 Plus program, estimated by mines family""**:
   - The Family 500 Plus program is a social welfare initiative in Poland aimed at providing financial support to families with children. The program's impact on birth rates would need to be verified with actual data.

3. **""i.e. it means, not even ten percent increase (...)""**:
   - To evaluate this, we need to know the baseline number of births before the program and the actual increase in births attributed to the program. If the baseline number of births is, for example, 300,000 per year, a 10% increase would be 30,000 additional births per year.

As of recent updates, the capacity has been increased to around 7.5 bcm per year, with plans for further expansion to 10 bcm per year by 2023-2024. There are also long-term plans to increase this capacity even further, but as of now, it has not reached 23 bcm.

3. **Supply Figures**: The claim mentions a supply figure of 23 billion cubic meters ""so far."" This could be interpreted as cumulative supply over several years, but it is not clear from the context. However, the terminal's annual capacity does not support the idea that it can handle 23 bcm in a single year.

Given these points, the claim contains inaccuracies regarding both the initial and current capacities of the LNG terminal. The figures provided do not align with the known data about the terminal's capacity and expansion plans.

2. **Comparison with Other Cities**: We need to verify if Jagodina is one of the three cities in Serbia with such a surplus.
3. **Impact on National Budget**: The claim suggests that if Jagodina's program were implemented in every city, there would be surpluses in the national budget, and salaries and pensions would be greater. This is a hypothetical scenario and would require economic analysis to validate.

Without specific data on Jagodina's financial surplus and the financial status of other cities in Serbia, as well as an economic analysis of the proposed scenario, it is challenging to fully validate the claim. However, we can make an educated assessment based on the available information.

I repeat, it is not the prime minister that publishes this judgment.",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the roles and responsibilities of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Government Legislation Center, and the Prime Minister in the context of publishing judgments.

1. **Constitutional Tribunal**: This is the highest constitutional court in some countries, responsible for reviewing the constitutionality of laws and regulations. It issues judgments on these matters.

2. **Government Legislation Center**: This body is often responsible for the publication of legal acts, including judgments from the Constitutional Tribunal, in the official gazette or other official publications.

3. **Prime Minister**: The Prime Minister typically does not have a direct role in the publication of judicial decisions. The Prime Minister's role is more executive and administrative, rather than judicial or legislative.

Your party [Platforma Obywatelska] has been building a gas terminal for 8 years.,half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the party Platforma Obywatelska (Civic Platform) has been building a gas terminal for 8 years, we need to look at the timeline and involvement of the party in the construction of the gas terminal.

The Świnoujście LNG terminal, also known as the President Lech Kaczyński LNG Terminal, is a significant project in Poland. The construction of this terminal began in 2008, during the tenure of the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) government, which was in power from 2007 to 2015. The terminal was officially opened in 2015, which means the construction and development spanned approximately 7 years.

Given this information, the claim that the Civic Platform has been building the gas terminal for 8 years is slightly exaggerated but not entirely off the mark. The party was indeed responsible for initiating and overseeing the majority of the construction period, although the exact duration was closer to 7 years.

"""Serbia's debt is 80 percent of GDP, it means that Serbia is a highly indebted country.""",mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Serbia's debt is 80 percent of GDP, it means that Serbia is a highly indebted country,"" we need to evaluate two components: the actual debt-to-GDP ratio of Serbia and the classification of what constitutes a ""highly indebted country.""

1. **Debt-to-GDP Ratio**: As of the latest available data, Serbia's debt-to-GDP ratio has fluctuated over recent years. For instance, in 2021, Serbia's public debt was around 57.9% of GDP. However, this figure can change annually based on economic conditions, government borrowing, and GDP growth. It is essential to check the most recent statistics to confirm the current debt-to-GDP ratio.

2. **Classification of ""Highly Indebted""**: The term ""highly indebted"" is somewhat subjective but generally, a debt-to-GDP ratio above 60% is often considered high by many economic standards, such as those used by the European Union's Maastricht criteria. A ratio of 80% would typically be considered high, though not necessarily extreme compared to some other countries with much higher ratios.

Given the most recent data available, Serbia's debt-to-GDP ratio is not 80%, but rather closer to around 58%. Therefore, the claim that Serbia's debt is 80% of GDP is inaccurate. However, if Serbia's debt were indeed 80% of GDP, it would be reasonable to consider it highly indebted.

It is worth noting that 70% of Poles support the reforms that we wanted to implement.,half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""It is worth noting that 70% of Poles support the reforms that we wanted to implement,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of Data**: The claim should be backed by reliable and recent survey data or polls conducted by reputable organizations.
2. **Specificity of Reforms**: The claim should specify which reforms are being referred to, as public support can vary significantly depending on the nature of the reforms.
3. **Context and Timing**: Public opinion can change over time, so the timing of the data is crucial.

Without specific details on the source of the data, the exact reforms in question, and the timing of the survey, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a specific, credible survey and refers to a well-defined set of reforms, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of detailed information provided in the claim, the most balanced assessment would be:

However, if we assume that the claim is referring to two different polls or time periods, it could be possible that both percentages were reported at different times. If the claim is suggesting that both percentages were reported simultaneously for the same poll, it would be contradictory.

Given the lack of specific context and verification, the claim appears to be ambiguous and potentially misleading.

The second industrial-innovative five-year plan typically refers to a specific period in a country's economic development strategy, often involving significant changes in industrial output, market strategies, and supply chain logistics. These plans are usually characterized by efforts to expand markets, innovate production processes, and improve supply chain efficiency.

Given that five-year plans are designed to bring about significant economic changes, it is unlikely that the ""circle of real sales markets"" and ""maintenance of supplies"" would remain unchanged. These elements are typically targeted for improvement and expansion.

Without specific historical data to confirm the exact details, the general nature of five-year plans suggests that changes are expected and intended.

"There is a matter of delegated employees, fundamental from the point of view of Polish interests.I remind you that eleven national parliaments gave the European Commission a yellow card in this matter.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the issue of delegated employees is fundamental from the point of view of Polish interests.
2. Whether eleven national parliaments gave the European Commission a yellow card on this matter.

### Point 1: Delegated Employees and Polish Interests
The issue of delegated employees, also known as posted workers, is indeed significant for Poland. Poland is one of the largest providers of posted workers in the European Union. Changes in regulations affecting posted workers can have substantial economic and social implications for Poland, making this issue fundamental from the Polish perspective.

### Point 2: Yellow Card Procedure
The ""yellow card"" procedure allows national parliaments to object to a legislative proposal from the European Commission if they believe it violates the principle of subsidiarity. For a yellow card to be issued, at least one-third of the national parliaments (currently 18 out of 54 votes) must submit reasoned opinions.

In May 2016, the European Commission's proposal to revise the Posting of Workers Directive did indeed receive a yellow card. Eleven national parliaments, including Poland's, submitted reasoned opinions against the proposal, triggering the yellow card procedure.

### Conclusion
Both points in the claim are accurate. The issue of delegated employees is fundamental from the Polish perspective, and eleven national parliaments did give the European Commission a yellow card on this matter.

The claim states that the attitudes of the State Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Slobodan Ilić, regarding the opening of the Gorenje plant in Zajecar will not disrupt the coalition ratios between G17 Plus and DS in Zajecar.

1. **Verification of the Claim**:
   - **Attitudes of Slobodan Ilić**: We need to know what specific attitudes or statements Slobodan Ilić has made about the Gorenje plant opening.
   - **Impact on Coalition Ratios**: We need to understand the current coalition dynamics between G17 Plus and DS in Zajecar and whether there have been any indications that these dynamics would be affected by Ilić's attitudes.

2. **Contextual Information**:
   - **Gorenje Plant Opening**: The opening of a new plant can have significant economic and political implications. It is important to know if there have been any controversies or differing opinions within the coalition regarding this event.
   - **Political Stability**: If the coalition between G17 Plus and DS is stable and there have been no recent conflicts or disruptions, it is more likely that the claim could be true.

Without specific evidence or statements from Slobodan Ilić and without detailed information on the coalition's current state, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim.

"""They (Salford) have a monopoly and claim to hold 60 percent of the Serbian market.""",mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Salford has a monopoly and claims to hold 60 percent of the Serbian market,"" we need to break down the statement into two parts: the monopoly claim and the market share claim.

1. **Monopoly Claim**: A monopoly implies that a single company has exclusive control over a particular market, with no significant competition. If Salford truly has a monopoly, it would mean they are the only significant player in the Serbian market.

2. **Market Share Claim**: Holding 60 percent of the market indicates a dominant position but does not necessarily equate to a monopoly. A company can have a large market share without being a monopoly if there are other competitors in the market.

Given that a 60 percent market share is substantial but does not inherently mean a monopoly (since other companies could still hold the remaining 40 percent), the statement is somewhat exaggerated in its use of the term ""monopoly.""

Chinese prime minister prays in the mosque,false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Chinese prime minister prays in the mosque,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Position Title**: China does not have a ""prime minister."" The equivalent position is the ""Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China.""

2. **Religious Practices**: China is officially an atheist state, and its top leaders, including the Premier, typically do not publicly engage in religious practices. The Chinese government maintains strict control over religious activities and often discourages public displays of religious affiliation by its top officials.

3. **Historical Context**: There have been instances where Chinese leaders have visited mosques, but these visits are usually diplomatic or cultural in nature rather than for the purpose of prayer.

Given these points, the claim that the Chinese Premier (often referred to as the prime minister in some contexts) prays in a mosque is highly unlikely and not supported by available evidence.

1. **Economic Data**: Recent reports and economic indicators can provide insights into the health of the construction industry. For example, if there has been a steady increase in construction projects, employment rates in the sector, and investment in infrastructure, it would suggest recovery.

2. **Industry Reports**: Reports from industry associations, such as the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) or the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), can offer detailed analyses of the industry's performance.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Insights from economists and industry experts can help contextualize the data and provide a more nuanced understanding of the industry's recovery.

4. **Geographical Variations**: The state of the construction industry can vary significantly by region. Some areas may be recovering faster than others.

Given that the construction industry has faced significant challenges due to economic downturns, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages, a slow recovery is plausible. However, without specific and up-to-date data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

Based on the general understanding that the construction industry has been gradually improving but still faces challenges, the claim seems to be more accurate than not.

Explanation: The claim that there is generally a system of distribution of light drugs in special places in many countries like Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands is not accurate for most of these countries. 

- In the Netherlands, there is a well-known system where cannabis can be sold and consumed in licensed coffee shops under certain regulations.
- In Germany, while there are discussions and pilot projects regarding the legalization and regulated distribution of cannabis, it is not yet a widespread system.
- In Great Britain, cannabis remains illegal, although there are some allowances for medical use.

"A group of international scientists concluded that Heparin contained in algae is able to block coronavirus SARS-COV-2.It turned out that heparin, by the ability to block SARS-COV-2, exceeds many antiviral drugs, including ""Remesivir""",half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the available scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of heparin derived from algae in blocking SARS-CoV-2 compared to other antiviral drugs like Remdesivir.

1. **Heparin and SARS-CoV-2**: Heparin is known for its anticoagulant properties, but some studies have suggested that it may have antiviral effects, including potential activity against SARS-CoV-2. Research has indicated that heparin can bind to the spike protein of the virus, potentially inhibiting its ability to infect cells.

2. **Comparative Efficacy**: While there is some evidence that heparin can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, the claim that it ""exceeds many antiviral drugs, including Remdesivir"" is more contentious. Remdesivir is an antiviral drug that has been specifically developed and tested for its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, and it has received emergency use authorization and approval in various countries based on clinical trial data.

3. **Scientific Consensus**: The scientific community generally requires extensive clinical trials and peer-reviewed studies to substantiate claims about the efficacy of treatments. While preliminary studies may show promise, they do not equate to conclusive evidence that one treatment is superior to another without rigorous comparative trials.

Given the current state of research, the claim that heparin from algae ""exceeds many antiviral drugs, including Remdesivir"" in blocking SARS-CoV-2 is not fully supported by comprehensive clinical evidence.

"""The government, as a key political organ that should lead to the state policy, does not lead external policy, but the service activity of the President of the Republic is the service.""",mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the roles and responsibilities of the government and the President in the context of external policy, which typically refers to foreign policy.

1. **Government's Role in State Policy**: The government, often led by the Prime Minister or equivalent, is generally responsible for the overall administration and implementation of state policies, including domestic and economic policies.

2. **President's Role in External Policy**: In many political systems, the President or head of state often plays a significant role in foreign policy and international relations. This can include representing the country abroad, negotiating treaties, and making key decisions regarding international affairs.

3. **Service Activity of the President**: The term ""service activity"" is somewhat ambiguous, but it could imply the President's duties and actions in the realm of foreign policy.

Given these points, the claim suggests that the government does not lead external policy, which is instead the domain of the President. This can be true in some political systems where the President has a strong role in foreign policy, but it is not universally applicable. In many countries, foreign policy is a collaborative effort between the government (executive branch) and the President, with significant input from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or equivalent.

**Analysis**:
- In some countries (e.g., the United States), the President has a significant role in foreign policy.
- In other countries (e.g., parliamentary systems like the UK), the Prime Minister and the government have a more prominent role in foreign policy, though the head of state may still have some influence.

**Conclusion**:
The claim is context-dependent and not universally true. It oversimplifies the complex interplay between different branches of government in foreign policy.

Two Chinese doctors, Dr. Yi Fan and Dr. Hu Weifeng, who were treating COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, contracted the virus themselves and experienced a change in skin color. This change in complexion was attributed to liver damage caused by the virus and the medications they were given during their treatment.

However, it's important to note that this is a very specific and rare case, and not a common symptom of COVID-19. The change in complexion was due to complications and the specific treatment they received, rather than a direct result of the virus itself.

1. **Data Verification**: Check the official statistics from the relevant authority (e.g., U.S. Census Bureau, local government databases) for the number of building permits issued in August of both years.
2. **Percentage Calculation**: Calculate the percentage increase or decrease in the number of building permits issued from August last year to August this year.
3. **Comparison**: Compare the calculated percentage with the claimed 23 percent increase.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and comes from a reliable source, the claim would be considered 'True'. If the data shows a different percentage, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly.

1. **Current Cabinet Composition**: We need the exact number of ministers in the current cabinet.
2. **Government of 2000 or Earlier**: We need the number of ministers in the government of 2000 or earlier.

Without specific numbers, we can only make a general assessment based on available data. Historically, the size of cabinets can vary significantly depending on the country and its administrative needs at the time.

If the current cabinet has fewer or a comparable number of ministers than the government of 2000 or earlier, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the current cabinet has significantly more ministers, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the statement is based on accurate data, we might lean towards it being 'Mostly True' as it suggests a comparison that implies a smaller or similar size.

This involves checking reliable sources such as official health statistics or reputable databases that track COVID-19 data.

1. **Spain**: According to various sources, including Worldometer and Our World in Data, Spain had a high number of COVID-19 deaths per million inhabitants, especially during the peak periods of the pandemic. The figure of 630 deaths per million inhabitants is plausible based on historical data.

2. **Poland**: Similarly, Poland's COVID-19 death rate per million inhabitants has been significantly lower than Spain's, but the figure of 65 deaths per million seems quite low. Poland's death rate per million inhabitants has generally been higher than this, especially during later waves of the pandemic.

Given the context and the need for precise numbers, the claim seems to be an oversimplification or outdated. The numbers might have been accurate at a specific point in time, but they do not reflect the overall trend observed throughout the pandemic.

41% of Kazakhstan’s business is experiencing big financial problems,half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""41% of Kazakhstan’s business is experiencing big financial problems,"" we need to verify the source and context of this statistic. This involves checking recent reports, surveys, or studies conducted by reputable organizations or government bodies that focus on Kazakhstan's business environment.

1. **Source Verification**: Identify the origin of the statistic. Is it from a credible source such as a government report, a reputable financial institution, or a recognized research organization?

2. **Contextual Analysis**: Understand the context in which the statistic was presented. Does it refer to a specific sector, time period, or type of business (e.g., small and medium enterprises vs. large corporations)?

3. **Comparative Data**: Compare this statistic with other available data on the financial health of businesses in Kazakhstan. Are there other reports or studies that support or contradict this figure?

Without access to specific and recent data sources, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a recent and credible survey or report, it could be considered accurate. Conversely, if there is no supporting evidence or if the statistic is outdated or misrepresented, the claim could be false.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the typical process of verification, I would lean towards a cautious assessment.

Today we have more and more suicides in schools.,half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Today we have more and more suicides in schools,"" we need to consider recent data and trends regarding youth suicides, particularly those occurring in school settings.

1. **Trends in Youth Suicide Rates**: According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the overall suicide rate among young people has been increasing over the past decade. This suggests a general upward trend in youth suicides.

2. **Specific to Schools**: While the overall youth suicide rate is rising, specific data on suicides occurring within school premises is less commonly reported. However, the increase in youth suicides can indirectly imply that schools, as a significant part of young people's lives, are also affected by this trend.

3. **Contributing Factors**: Various factors contribute to the rise in youth suicides, including mental health issues, bullying, social media influence, and academic pressures. Schools are environments where these factors can be particularly pronounced.

Given the available information, the claim that there are ""more and more suicides in schools"" aligns with the broader trend of increasing youth suicides, though specific data on school premises is less clear.

"While Germany is our greatest trading partner, Great Britain is our second trading partner in order.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to look at the most recent and reliable trade data between the countries mentioned. The claim states that Germany is the greatest trading partner and Great Britain is the second trading partner.

As of the latest available data, Germany is indeed one of the largest trading partners for many countries, including those in the European Union. However, the position of Great Britain as the second trading partner can vary significantly depending on the specific country in question.

For example, if we consider the European Union as a whole, Germany is often the largest trading partner, but the second position is not consistently held by Great Britain. Other countries like China, the United States, and France often rank higher in trade volume with many EU countries.

If we consider a specific country, such as the Netherlands, Germany is the largest trading partner, but the second position is typically held by countries like Belgium or the United States, not Great Britain.

Given this variability and the lack of specificity in the claim regarding which country is being referred to, the statement is not universally accurate.

"""This also speaks of greater mutual trust, our national airline and airport, but also safety conditions and everything Serbia has achieved, because it cannot fly for the United States, as we could not have been 25 years.""",mostly false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the key points:

1. **Greater Mutual Trust**: This is a subjective statement and difficult to verify without specific metrics or evidence.
2. **National Airline and Airport**: This could be referring to improvements or achievements in Serbia's aviation sector, which might be verifiable through industry reports or official statements.
3. **Safety Conditions**: This can be checked against international aviation safety standards and records.
4. **Serbia's Achievements**: This is a broad statement that could encompass various sectors, not just aviation.
5. **Cannot Fly for the United States**: This implies that there were restrictions or bans on flights between Serbia and the United States, which can be verified through historical aviation agreements and records.
6. **25 Years Ago**: This suggests a specific timeframe for when the restrictions were in place.

Given these points, we need to verify if Serbia's national airline and airport have indeed improved to the extent that they now meet international safety standards and if there were indeed restrictions on flights to the United States 25 years ago.

- **Historical Context**: Serbia faced various international sanctions and restrictions during the 1990s, which could have included aviation restrictions.
- **Current Status**: If Serbia's national airline is now flying to the United States, it indicates compliance with international aviation standards.

Based on this analysis, the claim seems to be largely accurate but contains subjective elements and broad statements that are harder to verify.

1. SMB increased a microcredit portfolio by 850% in the first half of 2020.
2. Overdue debt increased by 238% of the main debt or accrued reward.
3. For individuals, the growth of microcredit was about 145%.
4. Overdue debt for individuals increased by 332%.

Without access to the specific data from the SMB (Small and Medium-sized Businesses) and the relevant financial reports for the first half of 2020, it is not possible to definitively verify these figures. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and there are no conflicting reports, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the figures, the best we can do is assess the internal consistency of the claim. The percentages provided are specific and detailed, which suggests a level of precision that would be unusual if the claim were fabricated.

"""It is not true that many devices will rise twenty percent due to environmental taxes.It is true that the ecological tax is only a few percent compared to the price. """,true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statements and verify their validity:

1. ""It is not true that many devices will rise twenty percent due to environmental taxes.""
2. ""It is true that the ecological tax is only a few percent compared to the price.""

The first statement asserts that the claim about a 20% price increase due to environmental taxes is false. The second statement supports this by saying that the ecological tax is only a few percent of the price.

If the ecological tax is indeed only a few percent of the price, then it is unlikely that it would cause a 20% increase in the price of many devices. Therefore, the first statement would be accurate.

Given this reasoning, the overall claim appears to be accurate.

"... according to scientific statistics, in general, each drug addict draws on average from 5 to 17 people into drug consumption ...",half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""each drug addict draws on average from 5 to 17 people into drug consumption,"" we need to examine the available scientific literature and statistics on the subject.

1. **Scientific Literature**: There is limited empirical evidence to support the specific claim that each drug addict influences exactly 5 to 17 other people to start using drugs. While it is true that social networks and peer influence play a significant role in drug use initiation, the exact number of people influenced by a single drug addict can vary widely based on numerous factors such as the type of drug, social environment, and individual circumstances.

2. **Peer Influence**: Research does indicate that drug use can spread through social networks, and individuals are more likely to use drugs if they have friends or family members who do. However, quantifying this influence with a precise number like 5 to 17 is not commonly supported by scientific studies.

3. **Variability**: The influence of a drug addict on others can be highly variable. Some addicts may have a significant impact on their social circle, while others may have little to no influence. The range of 5 to 17 people seems arbitrary and not grounded in robust scientific evidence.

Given the lack of specific scientific backing for the exact numbers provided in the claim, it is not accurate to state this as a general rule.

2. **France**: Schools in France were closed on March 16, 2020. By that date, France had significantly more than 2,000 confirmed cases. In fact, France had over 5,000 confirmed cases by mid-March 2020.

Given this information:
- The claim about Poland closing schools when there were around 30 cases is accurate.
- The claim about France closing schools when there were 2,000 cases is inaccurate, as the number of cases was much higher by the time schools were closed.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains some elements of truth.

Grande Parte Da Mídia Achava Que Ele [Cesare Battisti] Era Um Pobre Coitado,half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Grande Parte Da Mídia Achava Que Ele [Cesare Battisti] Era Um Pobre Coitado,"" we need to consider the general portrayal of Cesare Battisti in the media.

Cesare Battisti is an Italian former member of the Armed Proletarians for Communism (PAC) who was convicted of murder in Italy. His case has been highly controversial and has received extensive media coverage over the years. Different media outlets have portrayed him in various ways, ranging from a political refugee and victim of judicial persecution to a convicted terrorist and murderer.

While some media outlets and commentators have indeed portrayed Battisti as a victim of political persecution, especially during his asylum period in France and Brazil, others have emphasized his criminal convictions and the suffering of his victims' families. Therefore, the portrayal of Battisti in the media has been mixed and not uniformly sympathetic.

Given this context, the claim that ""Grande Parte Da Mídia Achava Que Ele Era Um Pobre Coitado"" is an oversimplification and does not accurately reflect the diverse perspectives presented in the media.

2. Whether ""The Journal of Immunology"" published an article titled “Understanding the essence of the mechanism of action of highly exposed biological preparations” on the mechanism of action of domestic “Ergoferon”.

1. According to the 2019 Journal Citation Reports, ""The Journal of Immunology"" was not the most cited journal in the field of immunology. The most cited journal in that year was ""Frontiers in Immunology.""

2. A search of the archives of ""The Journal of Immunology"" does not show any article titled “Understanding the essence of the mechanism of action of highly exposed biological preparations” related to ""Ergoferon.""

5. **False**: The claim would be 'False' if almost none of the conditions have been met.

Without specific evidence or context to verify the fulfillment of the action plan, it is challenging to accurately categorize the claim. However, based on the phrasing ""practically fully fulfilled,"" it suggests that most, but not necessarily all, conditions have been met.

1. ""You can't shave (Members of REM), I think paragraph 2 is very explicitly said, that it is necessary to obtain an opinion of all members of the Council, and only then you can access dismissal.""
   - This part of the statement suggests that a specific paragraph (presumably in a legal or organizational document) requires the opinion of all council members before a dismissal can occur. 

2. ""Do you really think six who are there are, that they will bother themselves and say 'Bring us everything'?""
   - This part of the statement is more speculative, questioning whether the six members would actually take the time to review everything.

To evaluate the truthfulness of the claim, we would need to:
- Verify the existence of the document and the specific paragraph mentioned.
- Confirm that the paragraph indeed states that the opinion of all council members is required for dismissal.
- Assess whether the council consists of six members and if they are likely to review everything.

"""Without our coalition, there will be no new governments, unless Democrats and Progressives form a majority.""",true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the context and the specifics of the political landscape being referred to. The claim suggests that without a particular coalition, new governments cannot be formed unless Democrats and Progressives form a majority. 

1. **Coalition Dependency**: The claim hinges on the idea that a coalition is essential for forming new governments. This is often true in parliamentary systems where no single party has a majority, and coalitions are necessary to achieve a governing majority.

2. **Majority Formation**: The claim also posits that the only alternative to this coalition is a majority formed by Democrats and Progressives. This implies that these groups are the only other significant political forces capable of forming a government.

To evaluate this, we need to consider:
- The political system in question (e.g., parliamentary vs. presidential).
- The current distribution of seats or power among political parties.
- Historical precedents of coalition formations and majority governments in that system.

If the political system is one where coalitions are typically necessary and the Democrats and Progressives are indeed the only other groups capable of forming a majority, the claim could be accurate. However, if there are other potential coalitions or if the system allows for minority governments, the claim might be less accurate.

1. **Widespread Fee for Maintaining Public Media**: This implies that there is a fee that is broadly applied or available for the purpose of maintaining public media. We need to verify if such a fee exists and is indeed widespread.

2. **Twice Lower than the Subscription**: This part of the claim suggests that the fee mentioned is half the cost of a subscription. We need to compare the fee to the subscription cost to see if it is indeed half.

Without specific data on the actual fees and subscription costs, it is challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, if we assume that the statement is based on accurate data, we can analyze the language used:

- ""Twice lower"" is a somewhat awkward way to say ""half the cost."" If the fee is indeed half the cost of the subscription, the claim could be considered accurate in that regard.

1. **Tusk's stance on kneeling before bishops**: In 2011, Donald Tusk, then Prime Minister of Poland, made statements indicating a more secular approach to governance and a desire to reduce the influence of the Catholic Church in state matters. However, specific phrasing about ""not kneeling before bishops"" would need to be verified through direct quotes or reliable sources from that time.

2. **Liquidating the church fund**: The church fund (Fundusz Kościelny) in Poland has been a topic of political debate. Tusk did propose reforms to the church fund, including its potential liquidation or transformation into a different form of financial support for the church.

1. **Historical Context**: The early 20th century saw significant advancements in agricultural practices, including animal husbandry. The introduction of mechanization, improved breeding techniques, and better veterinary care generally led to increased productivity in animal farming.

1. The submission of a financial report on the state of finance in the city.
2. The existence of close to six billion dinars in urban accounts.

Without additional context or evidence to verify these points, it is not possible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a credible source and there is no contradictory information available, we might lean towards a certain level of truthfulness.

"In 2010, the decision of President Obama and NATO was adopted so -called eventual plans for Poland and Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, where NATO was very precisely described, i.e. Poland will also defend these territories.",true,pl,"The claim refers to the development of NATO defense plans for Poland and the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) during President Obama's administration. In 2010, NATO did indeed adopt contingency plans, known as ""Eagle Guardian,"" to defend these countries in the event of an attack. This was part of a broader effort to reassure Eastern European NATO members in the face of potential threats, particularly from Russia.

Given this context, the claim that ""In 2010, the decision of President Obama and NATO was adopted so-called eventual plans for Poland and Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, where NATO was very precisely described, i.e. Poland will also defend these territories"" is largely accurate. However, the phrasing is somewhat unclear and could be more precise in describing the nature of the plans and the role of Poland.

"""It is a shame that the largest number of social assistance beneficiaries in the richest piece of Serbia and no one is proud of such Vojvodina.""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. **Vojvodina's Wealth**: Vojvodina is indeed one of the wealthiest regions in Serbia, known for its agricultural productivity and economic development compared to other parts of the country.

2. **Social Assistance Beneficiaries**: The claim states that Vojvodina has the largest number of social assistance beneficiaries. This would require specific data on social assistance distribution across Serbia's regions. If Vojvodina has the highest number of beneficiaries, the claim would be accurate. However, if another region has more beneficiaries, the claim would be inaccurate.

Without specific data on the distribution of social assistance beneficiaries across Serbia, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, given Vojvodina's economic status, it might be less likely to have the highest number of beneficiaries compared to less affluent regions.

"""I'll hand over Mr. File and answers to the questionnaire that they have not yet sent us.Simply, in this way we will shorten in a few months from the moment you officially get that questionnaire that we need to answer it. """,half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and analyze its components:

1. ""I'll hand over Mr. File and answers to the questionnaire that they have not yet sent us.""
   - This implies that the speaker is providing both a person (Mr. File) and answers to a questionnaire that has not yet been received.

2. ""Simply, in this way we will shorten in a few months from the moment you officially get that questionnaire that we need to answer it.""
   - This suggests that by providing the answers in advance, the process will be expedited by a few months once the questionnaire is officially received.

Given these points, the claim seems to be making a logical assumption that preemptively providing answers will save time. However, the feasibility and accuracy of this assumption depend on several factors, such as whether the preemptive answers will be accepted and whether the questionnaire's content remains unchanged.

Since the claim is based on a logical assumption but lacks concrete evidence to fully support the outcome, it can be considered partially accurate but not entirely certain.

"""The general state deficit is drastically below what the deficit has the most significant EU countries, except for Germany, which we are extremely operating and which we cannot compare.One France has two and a half times a larger deficit from Serbia.""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the key points and verify them with reliable data:

1. **General State Deficit Comparison**: The claim states that Serbia's general state deficit is drastically below that of the most significant EU countries, except for Germany.
2. **France's Deficit**: The claim also states that France has a deficit two and a half times larger than Serbia's.

### Verification:

1. **Serbia's Deficit**: According to recent data, Serbia's budget deficit has varied, but for the sake of this analysis, let's assume a recent figure of around 3-4% of GDP.
2. **Germany's Deficit**: Germany has been known for maintaining a relatively low budget deficit, often close to 0% or even a surplus in some years.
3. **France's Deficit**: France has had a higher budget deficit, often around 7-9% of GDP in recent years, especially considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Analysis:

- **Germany**: The claim that Germany's deficit is low and not comparable to Serbia's is accurate.
- **France**: If Serbia's deficit is around 3-4% and France's is around 7-9%, then France's deficit is indeed approximately two to three times larger than Serbia's, which aligns with the claim of ""two and a half times.""

### Conclusion:

The claim is generally accurate in its comparison of Serbia's deficit with Germany and France. However, the exact figures can vary slightly based on the specific year and economic conditions.

I expect that we will have the largest rate of economic growth in the region next year.,mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I expect that we will have the largest rate of economic growth in the region next year,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Expectation vs. Fact**: The statement is an expectation or prediction about future economic growth, not a statement of current fact.
2. **Economic Data**: To verify the claim, we would need access to economic forecasts and data for the region in question. This includes growth projections from credible sources such as government reports, international organizations (e.g., IMF, World Bank), and economic research institutions.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: We would need to compare the expected growth rate of the entity making the claim with the expected growth rates of other entities in the same region.

Given that the statement is a prediction and not a verifiable fact at this moment, it is challenging to categorize it definitively without the specific economic forecasts and comparative data.

**However**, if we assume that the person making the claim has access to reliable economic forecasts and is basing their expectation on credible data, the claim could be considered plausible but not certain.

"Family benefits have been increased in 8 years of the platform by PLN 9.I know what I'm saying, about 9 zlotys, sir.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Family benefits have been increased in 8 years of the platform by PLN 9,"" we need to consider the context and the actual data regarding family benefits in Poland over the past 8 years.

1. **Context**: The statement seems to be referring to the increase in family benefits over a period of 8 years. The term ""platform"" likely refers to the ruling party or government in power during this period.

2. **Data Verification**: 
   - Family benefits in Poland have seen various changes over the years, including the introduction of the ""500+ program"" which provides PLN 500 per month per child.
   - If the claim is that the total increase in family benefits over 8 years is only PLN 9, this would be a significant understatement given the substantial increases from programs like ""500+"".

3. **Analysis**:
   - The introduction of the ""500+"" program alone represents a significant increase in family benefits, far exceeding PLN 9.
   - Therefore, the claim that family benefits have only increased by PLN 9 over 8 years is highly unlikely and does not align with the known data.

Based on this analysis, the claim appears to be incorrect.

"""We have increased only the budget of the Film Center, it is 50 times higher than six times this year.So we never gave money for domestic cinematography again. """,mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify each part:

1. ""We have increased only the budget of the Film Center, it is 50 times higher than six times this year.""
2. ""So we never gave money for domestic cinematography again.""

First, let's analyze the first part:
- If the budget of the Film Center is 50 times higher than six times this year, it implies a significant increase. However, the phrasing is somewhat confusing. If we interpret ""six times this year"" as the budget being six times higher earlier in the year, and now it is 50 times that amount, it suggests a substantial increase. 

Second, let's analyze the second part:
- The statement ""So we never gave money for domestic cinematography again"" implies that no funds were allocated to domestic cinematography after the increase in the Film Center's budget. 

To verify the truthfulness of these claims, we would need specific budgetary data for the Film Center and domestic cinematography funding. Without this data, we can only assess the logical consistency of the statement.

Given the confusing nature of the first part and the absolute nature of the second part, the claim seems to be an overstatement and lacks clarity.

1. **Source of the Claim**: The credibility of the source making the claim is important. If the claim comes from a reliable government report or a reputable financial analysis, it is more likely to be accurate.

2. **Details of the Pension Reform**: Understanding the specific reforms implemented and their projected financial impact is crucial. This includes changes in retirement age, pension calculation methods, and other policy adjustments.

3. **Economic Context**: The broader economic context, including inflation rates, economic growth, and other fiscal policies, can affect the actual savings achieved.

4. **Verification from Independent Sources**: Cross-referencing the claim with independent financial analyses or reports from international organizations like the IMF or World Bank can provide additional validation.

Without specific data and verification from reliable sources, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible government projection and there are no significant economic disruptions, it could be considered plausible.

"In Germany, when the beer consumption grew for years, it dragged hops behind it.In Poland, you have a twenty -time increase in beer consumption and a decrease in hop production.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine historical data on beer consumption and hop production in both Germany and Poland.

1. **Germany:**
   - Historically, Germany has been one of the largest beer consumers in the world.
   - The country is also one of the largest producers of hops, with regions like Hallertau being famous for hop cultivation.
   - As beer consumption grew in Germany, hop production also increased to meet the demand for brewing.

2. **Poland:**
   - Poland has seen a significant increase in beer consumption over the past few decades.
   - However, hop production in Poland has not kept pace with the increase in beer consumption. In fact, there has been a decline in hop production in recent years.

Given this information, the claim that in Germany, beer consumption growth dragged hops behind it is accurate. The claim that in Poland, there has been a twenty-time increase in beer consumption and a decrease in hop production is also accurate, though the exact figure of ""twenty-time"" might be an exaggeration. However, the general trend is correct.

1. **Time Frame**: The claim mentions ""the seventh year from a seven-year perspective."" This implies a specific period, likely a funding or development program cycle. We need to confirm if such a cycle exists and if we are indeed in the seventh year.

2. **Funding Amount**: The claim states ""60 billion"" as the total amount allocated. We need to verify if this figure is accurate for the specified program or funding cycle.

3. **Disbursement to Farmers**: The claim mentions ""27 only went to farmers' accounts."" This suggests that out of the 60 billion, only 27 billion has been disbursed to farmers. We need to check if this figure is correct.

4. **Modernization of Farms**: The claim states that ""less than 1/3"" of the funds have been used for farm modernization activities. We need to verify the actual percentage of funds allocated to this purpose.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to verify the exact figures. However, based on the structure and typical funding disbursement patterns, we can make an educated assessment.

1. The current level of coverage of imports by exports in Serbia is 58 percent.
2. This 58 percent is the highest degree of coverage Serbia has had in this century.

Without access to the most recent and historical trade data for Serbia, it's challenging to definitively confirm or refute these points. However, based on general knowledge and typical economic trends, we can make an educated assessment.

1. **Current Level of Coverage**: The claim states that the coverage of imports by exports is 58 percent. This figure can be plausible, as many countries often have a trade deficit where imports exceed exports, and a coverage ratio around this range is not uncommon.

2. **Historical Comparison**: The claim also states that this 58 percent is the highest in this century. This would require a detailed review of Serbia's trade data over the past two decades. If Serbia has historically had lower coverage ratios, then 58 percent could indeed be the highest.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute these points precisely, but considering the plausibility of the figures and the context provided, the claim seems to be reasonably accurate but not definitively verifiable without further data.

1. **€100 per person per month**:
   - This translates to approximately €3.33 per person per day (€100 / 30 days).

2. **€60 per person per day in Belgium**:
   - This translates to €1,800 per person per month (€60 * 30 days).

The claim suggests a significant difference in the financial support provided in the two contexts. Specifically, it implies that the support in Belgium is much higher (€60 per day) compared to the other context (€100 per month).

Given these calculations, the claim appears to be accurate in terms of the numerical comparison.

1. **Leaving children alone unattended up to 12 years**: It is generally true that many countries, including Kazakhstan, have laws or guidelines that prohibit leaving young children unattended. However, the specific age and enforcement can vary.

2. **Child returning from school and going for bread**: This is more of a practical concern rather than a legal one. While it might be discouraged for safety reasons, it is not necessarily a legal requirement that children cannot return from school or run small errands.

3. **Viewing, reading, and distributing inappropriate materials**: It is true that parents are generally responsible for ensuring their children do not access inappropriate content. However, the claim about the state not blocking internet resources and the specific incident of porn on Zoom would need more context. The state does have some responsibility for regulating internet content, but parents also play a role in monitoring their children's internet use.

4. **Compliance with school rules and charter**: Parents are indeed expected to ensure their children comply with school rules. However, occasional lateness is unlikely to result in a child being placed in an orphanage. This part of the claim seems exaggerated.

5. **Other duties provided by the legislation**: This is a general statement that is true, as parents are expected to fulfill various duties as outlined by national laws.

Given the mix of accurate statements, exaggerations, and the need for more context in some areas, the overall claim can be considered partially accurate but with significant caveats.

2. ""may not be elected the largest number of mandates"": This implies that the individual may not have the highest number of seats or terms in office.

3. ""but with the largest number of votes in the modern history of Serbia"": This part of the claim suggests that the individual received the highest number of votes in a single election in modern Serbian history.

To verify these points, we would need to check:
- The current Prime Minister or President of Serbia.
- The election results and historical voting data to see if this individual received the largest number of votes in a single election.

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the President of Serbia is Aleksandar Vučić, and the Prime Minister is Ana Brnabić. Aleksandar Vučić has been known to receive a significant number of votes in recent elections, but verifying if it is the largest in modern history would require specific election data.

According to various sources, including reports from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other agricultural statistics, Kazakhstan's cotton production has varied over the years. However, the average production figures tend to be significantly lower than 300 thousand tons per year.

"They allowed psychiatric diagnoses not only to a psychiatrist, but a simple doctor who did not even learn psychiatry.",half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the general practices and regulations regarding psychiatric diagnoses.

1. **Psychiatric Diagnoses by Psychiatrists**: Psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in mental health. They have completed medical school and additional specialized training in psychiatry. They are the primary professionals responsible for diagnosing and treating mental health disorders.

2. **General Practitioners (GPs) and Psychiatric Diagnoses**: General practitioners, or family doctors, are also medical doctors but do not have specialized training in psychiatry. However, in many healthcare systems, GPs are often the first point of contact for patients with mental health concerns. They can make preliminary diagnoses and provide initial treatment or referrals to specialists, including psychiatrists.

3. **Regulations and Practices**: The ability of GPs to diagnose psychiatric conditions can vary by country and healthcare system. In some places, GPs are allowed to diagnose and treat common mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, especially in areas with limited access to psychiatrists. However, for more complex or severe psychiatric conditions, a referral to a psychiatrist is typically recommended.

Given this context, the claim that ""They allowed psychiatric diagnoses not only to a psychiatrist, but a simple doctor who did not even learn psychiatry"" is somewhat misleading. While it is true that general practitioners can make preliminary psychiatric diagnoses and manage certain mental health conditions, they do have medical training and are not ""simple doctors"" without any knowledge of psychiatry.

If the law stipulates that a certain number of members are required for the VSS to operate legitimately, then an incomplete composition could indeed render its work illegitimate.

2. **Current Composition**: We need to verify whether the VSS is currently operating with an incomplete composition and whether this incompleteness violates any legal requirements.

3. **Official Statements or Rulings**: Any official statements, rulings, or legal interpretations from relevant authorities (e.g., courts, legal experts) regarding the legitimacy of the VSS's work in its current state would be crucial.

Without specific details on the legal requirements for the VSS's composition and any official rulings or statements, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if the legal framework clearly states that an incomplete composition renders the VSS's work illegitimate, and the VSS is indeed operating with an incomplete composition, the claim would be 'True'.

Given the lack of specific details in the provided information, we can make a reasoned judgment based on the general principles of legal and procedural legitimacy.

"Emigration was the highest immediately after entering the Union, and now it stays at a stable level.",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider historical data on emigration patterns for a specific country after it joined a union, such as the European Union (EU) or the United States (US). The claim suggests that emigration peaked immediately after the country joined the union and has since stabilized.

1. **Historical Context**: When countries join unions like the EU, there can be an initial surge in emigration due to new opportunities for work, education, and residence in other member states. This is often driven by the removal of barriers to movement and the allure of better economic prospects.

2. **Stabilization**: Over time, as the initial excitement and opportunities are absorbed, emigration rates may stabilize. This can be due to various factors such as economic improvements in the home country, saturation of job markets in destination countries, or changes in immigration policies.

3. **Data Analysis**: To verify the claim, we would need to look at specific emigration data from the country in question over a period before and after joining the union. This data would show whether there was indeed a peak followed by stabilization.

Without specific data, we can only make a general assessment based on typical patterns observed in similar scenarios.

**General Assessment**:
- It is common for emigration to spike after a country joins a union due to new opportunities.
- Over time, emigration rates often stabilize as the initial wave of emigrants settles and the home country's conditions improve or adapt.

Given this general understanding, the claim aligns with typical patterns observed in similar situations.

1. **Polish Economy Energy Consumption**: The claim states that the Polish economy is nearly twice as energy-consuming as the European average. According to data from sources like Eurostat, Poland's energy intensity (energy consumption per unit of GDP) is indeed higher than the European average, but it is not necessarily ""twice"" as high. It is significantly higher, but the exact multiple can vary.

2. **Primary Energy Utilization**: The claim suggests that out of 100 units of primary energy, only a dozen or so are effectively used, with the rest being lost during energy processing, transport, and receipt. This implies a very high level of inefficiency. While energy losses do occur at various stages, the specific figures provided (only a dozen units used out of 100) seem exaggerated. The actual efficiency rates can vary, but they are generally higher than what is suggested here.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also exaggerates certain aspects, particularly the degree of inefficiency and the comparison to the European average.

"These PLN 15 (as part of the audiovisual fee) will be charged from each meter, not from the TV.*",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the context and specifics of the audiovisual fee in question. The claim states that PLN 15 will be charged from each meter, not from the TV.

1. **Audiovisual Fee Context**: Typically, audiovisual fees are charged based on the ownership or usage of devices capable of receiving broadcast signals, such as televisions or radios. It is unusual for such fees to be charged based on a unit of measurement like a meter.

2. **Verification**: Without specific information about a unique policy or regulation that charges audiovisual fees based on meters, the claim seems highly unlikely and inconsistent with common practices.

Given the standard practices and the unusual nature of the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is not accurate.

"According to Vaers, from 2006 to 2019 after vaccination of HPV in the United States, 3,000 became disabled, 480 died, more than 300 have a cervical dysplasia and more than 400 cervical cancer appeared",false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, it's important to understand what VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) is and how it operates. VAERS is a passive reporting system co-managed by the CDC and the FDA, designed to collect information about adverse events that occur after the administration of vaccines. However, reports to VAERS can be submitted by anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, or family members, and the reports themselves do not establish causality. This means that the events reported are not necessarily caused by the vaccine.

Given this context, let's break down the claim:

1. **3,000 became disabled**: This number is a report of adverse events and does not confirm causality.
2. **480 died**: Similarly, this number is a report and does not confirm that the deaths were caused by the HPV vaccine.
3. **More than 300 have cervical dysplasia**: This is a report and does not confirm causality.
4. **More than 400 cervical cancer appeared**: This is a report and does not confirm causality.

The numbers mentioned could be accurate in terms of what has been reported to VAERS, but they do not imply that the HPV vaccine caused these outcomes. Therefore, the claim can be misleading if interpreted as establishing a direct causal relationship between the HPV vaccine and these adverse events.

1. **Poland as an ally of Israel for many years**: Historically, Poland and Israel have had diplomatic relations and cooperation in various fields, including political, economic, and cultural areas. However, the relationship has had its ups and downs, particularly due to historical issues and differing stances on certain international matters.

2. **Poland on the side of Israel**: Poland has often shown support for Israel in various international forums, but this support is not unconditional and can vary depending on the specific issue at hand.

3. **Recent vote in the UN Security Council**: Poland is not a permanent member of the UN Security Council, but it has served as a non-permanent member at various times. The claim refers to a specific vote where Poland abstained, which is interpreted as support for Israel. Without the exact date and context of the vote, it's challenging to verify this specific instance. However, Poland has abstained in votes related to Israel in the past, which can be seen as a form of indirect support.

Given the historical context and the general pattern of Poland's actions in international forums, the claim has elements of truth but may lack specific details and context.

The Warsaw In Vitro program is already over 200 happy families.,true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Warsaw In Vitro program is already over 200 happy families,"" we need to verify the number of families that have benefited from the program. This would involve checking reliable sources such as official reports, news articles, or statements from the Warsaw In Vitro program itself.

If the available data confirms that over 200 families have indeed benefited from the program, the claim would be 'True'. If the number is close but not exactly 200, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the number is significantly lower, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on how far off it is.

Without specific data to verify the exact number of families, we cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information from a reliable source, we might lean towards 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

Final Answer: Without specific verification, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, assuming the claim is based on accurate information, it would likely be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.",,False,True
Even Bill Gates said that 700 thousand people would initially die from the vaccine,false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Even Bill Gates said that 700 thousand people would initially die from the vaccine,"" we need to look at the context and the exact statements made by Bill Gates.

Bill Gates has been a prominent advocate for vaccines and has discussed the potential risks and benefits of vaccination. In an interview, Gates mentioned that with a global vaccination effort, there could be side effects, and he used a hypothetical number to illustrate the point. He said that if 1 in 10,000 people had a severe side effect, with billions of people getting vaccinated, that could result in a significant number of adverse events. However, he did not specifically say that 700,000 people would die from the vaccine.

The claim misrepresents Gates' comments by taking them out of context and exaggerating the implications. Gates was discussing the importance of monitoring vaccine safety and the potential for rare side effects, not predicting a specific number of deaths.

"Judges (CT) were elected, who can, should already, three should already take their office, because the term of office of previous on November 6 ended.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. Judges in Connecticut (CT) are elected.
2. Three judges should already take their office.
3. The term of office of the previous judges ended on November 6.

Let's break down each point:

1. **Judges in Connecticut (CT) are elected**: In Connecticut, judges are not elected by the public. Instead, they are nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the General Assembly. Therefore, this part of the claim is incorrect.

2. **Three judges should already take their office**: Without specific context or names, it's difficult to verify this part. However, if the first part of the claim is incorrect, this part is also likely to be based on a misunderstanding.

3. **The term of office of the previous judges ended on November 6**: This is a specific detail that would require verification against official records. However, given that the first part of the claim is incorrect, this detail is also likely to be inaccurate or irrelevant.

Given that the foundational premise of the claim (that judges in Connecticut are elected) is incorrect, the entire claim is fundamentally flawed.

1. **Serbia's Position in ICT Sector**: According to various reports and statistics, Serbia has made significant strides in promoting gender equality in the ICT sector. Initiatives and programs aimed at encouraging girls to pursue careers in ICT have been implemented, and there has been noticeable progress.

2. **Comparison with European Union Countries**: The European Union has also been actively working on increasing female participation in the ICT sector. However, the progress varies significantly among member states. Some countries have higher participation rates, while others lag behind.

3. **Data and Reports**: Specific data from organizations like Eurostat, UNESCO, and the European Commission would provide insights into the actual numbers and rankings. As of the latest reports, Serbia is recognized for its efforts, but claiming it as the absolute leader in Europe might be an overstatement without concrete comparative data.

4. **Timeframe for EU Countries**: The claim that EU countries will need ""decades"" to reach Serbia's level is speculative. While some EU countries may take longer to achieve gender parity in ICT, others are already making rapid progress.

Given the available information, the claim seems to be an exaggeration of Serbia's achievements relative to the entire European context.

"In Finland, more than $ 1 billion from lottery activity through the operator is aimed at developing sports and physical culture, as well as art and culture",true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Finland, more than $1 billion from lottery activity through the operator is aimed at developing sports and physical culture, as well as art and culture,"" we need to examine the specifics of how lottery funds are allocated in Finland.

In Finland, Veikkaus Oy is the state-owned company that operates lotteries and other gambling activities. The revenue generated by Veikkaus is indeed used to support various public interest activities, including sports, physical culture, science, art, and youth work. The allocation of these funds is overseen by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture.

However, the exact amount allocated annually can vary. While it is true that significant funds are directed towards these areas, the claim specifies ""more than $1 billion."" To verify this, we would need to look at the most recent financial reports and allocations from Veikkaus.

Based on available data, Veikkaus generates substantial revenue, and a significant portion is indeed allocated to the mentioned areas. However, whether it consistently exceeds $1 billion annually in USD terms would require specific financial data from recent years.

We must remember that this [anti -smog] law will largely eliminate the possibility of heating by coal stoves.In a situation where 70% of people in southern Poland are so heating.,true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. The anti-smog law will largely eliminate the possibility of heating by coal stoves.
2. 70% of people in southern Poland are heating by coal stoves.

### Point 1: Anti-Smog Law and Coal Stoves
Anti-smog laws typically aim to reduce air pollution by restricting the use of high-emission heating sources, such as coal stoves. If the law is stringent, it could indeed largely eliminate the possibility of heating by coal stoves. However, the extent of this elimination would depend on the specific provisions of the law, such as whether it includes financial support for transitioning to cleaner heating methods.

### Point 2: Heating by Coal Stoves in Southern Poland
Southern Poland, particularly regions like Silesia and Lesser Poland, has a high prevalence of coal stove usage due to historical and economic factors. While exact statistics can vary, it is plausible that a significant portion of the population relies on coal stoves for heating. However, the claim that 70% of people in southern Poland use coal stoves might be an overestimation or could vary by specific areas within southern Poland.

### Conclusion
Given the information, the claim that the anti-smog law will largely eliminate the possibility of heating by coal stoves is plausible but depends on the specifics of the law. The claim that 70% of people in southern Poland heat with coal stoves is likely an overgeneralization, though coal stoves are indeed common in the region.

Without specific details about who ""they"" are, what ""promote"" means in this context, and any relevant policies or actions taken, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

However, if we assume the statement is made in a context where an individual is restricted from promoting themselves or their work due to explicit rules or policies, and there is evidence to support this, the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if there is no evidence or the context suggests otherwise, the claim could be false.

Given the lack of specific context and evidence provided in the statement, we cannot definitively categorize it as true or false. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization based on the information provided would be 'Half True,' as it acknowledges the possibility of some truth but also the lack of complete information.

"""I advise citizens to save in dinars because one is safe, this dinar interest rate is much greater than inflation rate.""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. **Safety of Saving in Dinars**: The safety of saving in a particular currency depends on the stability of the currency and the economic conditions of the country. If the dinar is from a country with a stable economy and low risk of devaluation, then it could be considered safe. However, if the country has economic instability, high inflation, or political issues, the safety of saving in dinars could be questionable.

2. **Dinar Interest Rate vs. Inflation Rate**: The claim states that the dinar interest rate is much greater than the inflation rate. This can be verified by comparing the current interest rates offered by banks for savings in dinars with the current inflation rate in the country. If the interest rate is indeed significantly higher than the inflation rate, then this part of the claim would be true.

Without specific data on the country in question, the stability of its currency, and the current economic indicators, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made in a context where the dinar is from a relatively stable economy and the interest rates are indeed higher than the inflation rate, the claim could be considered mostly true.

3. **Cost Estimates**: The initial cost estimate for the first line of the subway was between 800 million and 1 billion euros, which was later corrected to between 800 million and 1.2 billion euros by the end of 2015.

Based on available information:

1. **Timeline**: Siniša Mali was the Mayor of Belgrade from 2014 to 2018, so it is plausible that he made statements about the subway project in 2015.
2. **Person**: Siniša Mali is a known political figure in Serbia, and it is reasonable to assume he would be involved in major infrastructure projects like the subway.
3. **Cost Estimates**: There are records indicating that initial cost estimates for the Belgrade subway project were indeed in the range of 800 million to 1 billion euros, and later estimates did increase to around 1.2 billion euros.

"The program of mental diagnostics and ""treatment"" of children was introduced into kindergartens and schools.(This can lead to a mass formulation of mental diagnoses to children).",false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and evidence available regarding mental diagnostics and treatment programs in educational settings.

1. **Mental Diagnostics and Treatment Programs**: Many educational systems worldwide have introduced mental health programs to identify and support children with mental health needs. These programs often involve screenings, assessments, and interventions by trained professionals.

2. **Mass Formulation of Mental Diagnoses**: The claim suggests that these programs could lead to a widespread increase in mental health diagnoses among children. While it is possible that increased screening could identify more children with mental health issues, it does not necessarily mean that diagnoses will be made indiscriminately or without proper evaluation.

3. **Evidence and Context**: The implementation and impact of such programs can vary significantly by region, country, and specific educational policies. Without specific evidence or data supporting the claim that these programs lead to a mass formulation of mental diagnoses, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim.

Given the general nature of the claim and the lack of specific evidence provided, it is reasonable to conclude that while mental health programs in schools can lead to increased identification of mental health issues, the assertion that this will result in a mass formulation of diagnoses is speculative.

A million patients with cancer in Poland and only PLN 1.5 billion for oncological treatment.,half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""A million patients with cancer in Poland and only PLN 1.5 billion for oncological treatment,"" we need to verify two main points: the number of cancer patients in Poland and the budget allocated for oncological treatment.

1. **Number of Cancer Patients in Poland:**
   - According to various health statistics and reports, Poland has a significant number of cancer patients. The exact number can vary, but estimates often suggest that there are around 1 million people living with cancer in Poland. This figure includes both newly diagnosed cases and those who have been living with the disease for some time.

2. **Budget for Oncological Treatment:**
   - The budget for oncological treatment in Poland is a bit more complex to pin down. The National Health Fund (NFZ) in Poland allocates funds for various health services, including oncology. Reports and budget documents from recent years indicate that the funding for oncological treatment is significantly higher than PLN 1.5 billion. For instance, in recent years, the budget for oncology has been reported to be several billion PLN, reflecting the high costs associated with cancer treatment.

Given this information, the claim seems to understate the budget for oncological treatment while accurately reflecting the number of cancer patients.

1. **Initial Public Debt Percentage**: The claim states that public debt was between 77% and 79% of GDP when the individual became prime minister. We need to check historical data to confirm this range.

2. **Current Public Debt Percentage**: The claim also states that the public debt will be below 50% of GDP before the end of the year. We need to verify current projections or recent data to confirm this.

Without specific data points or the identity of the prime minister and the country in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and aligns with historical and current economic reports, we can make an informed judgment.

1. **Policy Effectiveness**: The claim states that the subsidy policy is ""well thought out and smart."" This is a subjective assessment and would require evidence of successful outcomes, such as economic growth, job creation, or other positive impacts directly attributable to the subsidies.

2. **Return on Investment**: The claim mentions that the policy ""returns four times in a budget to a single investor."" This is a specific and quantifiable statement. To verify this, we would need access to financial data or reports showing that for every unit of currency invested by the government, there is a fourfold return in the budget.

3. **Monitoring**: The claim asserts that the policy is ""strictly monitored."" This would require evidence of oversight mechanisms, audits, or evaluations that ensure the subsidies are used effectively and efficiently.

Without access to specific data or reports from the Government of the Republic of Serbia or independent evaluations, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the statement and the need for evidence to support such specific claims, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the claim itself and the need for verification of the specific return on investment and monitoring processes, the claim appears to be partially verifiable but not fully substantiated.

2. **Registration of NOP Symbols**: It mentions that the ruling involved the registration of NOP (National Rebirth of Poland) symbols, including the Celtic cross.
3. **No Constitutional Violations Found**: The claim asserts that the Tribunal did not find any constitutional violations in registering these symbols.
4. **Court Registration**: It concludes that the court had to register the symbols following the Tribunal's ruling.

Upon reviewing available information:

1. **Constitutional Tribunal Ruling in 2011**: There was indeed a ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal in 2011 regarding the registration of certain symbols.
2. **Registration of NOP Symbols**: The NOP is a far-right political party in Poland, and the Celtic cross is one of its symbols. The Tribunal's decision did involve the registration of such symbols.
3. **No Constitutional Violations Found**: The Tribunal ruled that the symbols did not violate the constitution, which aligns with the claim.
4. **Court Registration**: Following the Tribunal's decision, the court would have been required to register the symbols as per the legal process.

Half of the budget is with VAT.,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Half of the budget is with VAT,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of the budget in question. VAT (Value Added Tax) is a type of consumption tax placed on a product whenever value is added at each stage of the supply chain. The statement could imply that half of the total budgeted revenue comes from VAT, or it could mean that half of the expenditures include VAT.

Without additional context or specific data about the budget being referred to, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, in most national or organizational budgets, it is unlikely that VAT alone would constitute half of the total budget, as budgets typically include a variety of revenue sources and expenditures.

1. **EU Accession Process**: Serbia has been a candidate country for EU membership since 2012. The accession process involves meeting various political, economic, and legislative criteria set by the EU.

2. **Recent Developments**: Over the past two years, there have been several factors that could influence Serbia's EU accession progress:
   - **Political and Judicial Reforms**: The EU has consistently emphasized the need for Serbia to implement reforms in areas such as the rule of law, judicial independence, and the fight against corruption.
   - **Relations with Kosovo**: The normalization of relations with Kosovo remains a significant condition for Serbia's EU accession. Any setbacks or lack of progress in this area could impact Serbia's EU prospects.
   - **EU Reports and Statements**: The European Commission publishes annual reports on candidate countries' progress. These reports provide insights into whether Serbia has made progress or faced setbacks in meeting EU criteria.

3. **Current Status**: As of the latest reports and statements from EU officials, there have been mixed reviews about Serbia's progress. While some reforms have been acknowledged, there are also concerns about backsliding in certain areas, particularly regarding democratic standards and media freedom.

Based on the available information, it appears that Serbia's progress towards EU membership has been uneven, with some areas of concern that might suggest it is not as close to meeting EU criteria as it was two years ago. However, this does not necessarily mean it is definitively ""further"" from the EU, as progress in some areas might offset setbacks in others.

"""Citizens voted for him in the last four rounds of choice and got more and more every time.Both him and the Serbian Advanced Party. """,true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Whether the individual in question has been voted for in the last four rounds of elections.
2. Whether the individual and the Serbian Advanced Party (Serbian Progressive Party) have received increasing support in each of these elections.

Aleksandar Vučić, the leader of the Serbian Progressive Party, has been a prominent political figure in Serbia. The Serbian Progressive Party has indeed seen significant electoral success in recent years. However, to accurately assess the claim, we need to look at the specific election results over the last four rounds.

1. **2012 Parliamentary Elections**: The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) won 24.04% of the vote.
2. **2014 Parliamentary Elections**: The SNS won 48.35% of the vote.
3. **2016 Parliamentary Elections**: The SNS won 48.25% of the vote.
4. **2020 Parliamentary Elections**: The SNS won 60.65% of the vote.

From these results, we can see that the Serbian Progressive Party's support increased significantly from 2012 to 2014, remained almost the same in 2016, and then increased again in 2020.

Given this information, the claim that ""Citizens voted for him in the last four rounds of choice and got more and more every time"" is not entirely accurate because the support did not increase in every single election (it remained almost the same between 2014 and 2016).

The claim suggests that for a span of six months in Belgrade, and almost in Serbia, there were no mafia-related murders. 

1. **Context and Time Period**: The claim does not specify the exact six months or the year. Without this information, it is challenging to verify the claim against crime statistics or news reports from that period.

2. **Crime Statistics**: If we had access to crime statistics from Belgrade and Serbia for the specified period, we could check for reported mafia-related murders. 

3. **News Reports**: Reviewing news archives for reports of mafia-related murders during the claimed period would also help verify the accuracy.

Given the lack of specific details and the need for precise data to confirm or refute the claim, it is difficult to definitively categorize it.

Official reports and data from health organizations indicated that China had hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases, but the exact number of infections, including unreported or asymptomatic cases, could potentially be in the millions.

Given the potential for underreporting and the large population of China, it is plausible that the total number of infections could reach into the millions over the course of the pandemic.

""",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into several parts and verify each one:

1. **Serbia was before the bankruptcy three years ago**: This part of the claim suggests that Serbia was on the brink of bankruptcy three years ago. While Serbia has faced economic challenges, there is no clear evidence that it was on the verge of bankruptcy exactly three years ago. The country has had issues with debt and economic instability, but ""bankruptcy"" is a strong term that may not accurately reflect the situation.

2. **Today it has a budget surplus**: Serbia has made significant strides in improving its fiscal situation. According to various reports, Serbia has managed to achieve a budget surplus in recent years, particularly through fiscal consolidation and economic reforms.

3. **Economy growth significantly higher than the European average**: Serbia has experienced economic growth, but whether it is ""significantly higher"" than the European average can vary depending on the specific time frame and metrics used. In some years, Serbia's growth rate has indeed been higher than the EU average, but this is not consistently the case.

4. **Serbia has shown that he can win. And not only in basketball and water polo, but also in economics and politics**: This is a more subjective statement. Serbia has had successes in sports like basketball and water polo. In terms of economics and politics, the country has made progress, but it still faces challenges such as corruption, political instability, and economic disparities.

Given the mixed accuracy of the individual components of the claim, the overall statement can be considered an exaggeration with some elements of truth.

"During martial law, almost 800 thousandPoles left Poland.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""During martial law, almost 800 thousand Poles left Poland,"" we need to consider historical data and context.

Martial law in Poland was declared on December 13, 1981, and lasted until July 22, 1983. During this period, the Polish government, led by the military, imposed severe restrictions on civil liberties, including curfews, censorship, and the suppression of political opposition.

According to historical records, the imposition of martial law led to significant political and economic turmoil, prompting many Poles to emigrate. However, the number of people who left Poland during this specific period is generally estimated to be lower than 800,000. Various sources suggest that the number of Poles who emigrated during the entire decade of the 1980s, which includes the martial law period, was around 700,000 to 800,000. 

Given that the claim specifies ""during martial law"" and not the entire decade, it is likely an overestimation to state that almost 800,000 Poles left specifically during the martial law period alone.

German commission - coronavirus - global false anxiety,false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""German commission - coronavirus - global false anxiety,"" we need to break down the components and verify their validity.

1. **German Commission**: There are various commissions and committees in Germany that have addressed the coronavirus pandemic. For example, the German Ethics Council and the Robert Koch Institute have been involved in providing guidance and information.

2. **Coronavirus**: The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a well-documented global pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide. This is a factual statement.

3. **Global False Anxiety**: This part of the claim suggests that the anxiety surrounding the coronavirus pandemic is false or unwarranted on a global scale. This is a subjective and controversial statement. The anxiety and concern about COVID-19 are based on scientific evidence of its impact on public health, economies, and daily life. While some individuals or groups may believe that the response to the pandemic has been exaggerated, the majority of the scientific and medical community supports the measures taken to control the virus.

Kazakhstan is a leader in Central Asia on the illegal conclusion of capital into offshore,half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Kazakhstan is a leader in Central Asia on the illegal conclusion of capital into offshore,"" we need to consider several factors, including available data on capital flight, reports from financial watchdogs, and comparisons with other Central Asian countries.

1. **Data on Capital Flight**: According to various reports, Kazakhstan has experienced significant capital flight over the years. For instance, the Global Financial Integrity (GFI) report has highlighted substantial illicit financial flows from Kazakhstan.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: When compared to other Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan's economy is larger and more integrated into the global financial system. This could potentially make it more susceptible to capital flight.

3. **Reports and Studies**: Various studies and reports, including those from international organizations and financial watchdogs, often cite Kazakhstan as a significant source of illicit financial flows in the region. However, these reports may not always provide a direct comparison with other Central Asian countries.

4. **Government and Regulatory Actions**: Kazakhstan has taken steps to combat illegal capital flight, but challenges remain. The effectiveness of these measures can influence the extent of capital flight.

Given the available information, it appears that Kazakhstan does have a notable issue with capital flight, and it is often highlighted in reports concerning illicit financial flows in Central Asia.

"""After 16 years, DS rule, we have 10,000 people who go to folk cuisine.""",mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Duration of DS rule**: The claim states that DS has been in power for 16 years.
2. **Number of people attending folk cuisine**: The claim mentions that 10,000 people go to folk cuisine.

Without specific data or context to verify these points, it is challenging to determine the exact truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the structure and the lack of verifiable information provided, we can make an educated guess.

Given the lack of context and specific data to support or refute the claim, it is difficult to ascertain its accuracy. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be 'Half True' as it acknowledges the possibility of some truth but also the lack of complete verification.

"""We need to present foreign investors that investment potentials are such that the profit that is realized herein, due to tax policy, financial stability, labor and its quality, higher than in the environment.""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate several factors:

1. **Tax Policy**: The claim suggests that the tax policy is favorable for foreign investors. This can vary significantly by country and region. Some countries offer tax incentives to attract foreign investment, while others may have higher tax rates.

2. **Financial Stability**: The claim implies that the country or region in question has financial stability. This can be assessed by looking at economic indicators such as inflation rates, currency stability, and overall economic growth.

3. **Labor Quality**: The claim states that the quality of labor is high. This can be measured by the education level, skill set, and productivity of the workforce.

4. **Profitability**: The claim asserts that the profit realized is higher than in the surrounding environment. This would require a comparative analysis of profit margins in similar industries across different regions.

Given that these factors can vary widely and are subject to change, the claim is somewhat subjective and context-dependent. Without specific data to back up each point, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim as entirely true or false.

1. The speaker's tenure: When did the speaker take over the government?
2. Recognition of Kosovo's independence: Which countries recognized Kosovo's independence during the speaker's tenure?

Let's break it down:

1. **Speaker's Tenure**: Identify the period when the speaker took over the government.
2. **Recognition of Kosovo's Independence**: Check the list of countries that recognized Kosovo's independence during that period.

Assuming the speaker is referring to a specific period, we need to cross-reference the countries that recognized Kosovo's independence during that time frame. 

For example, if the speaker is Albin Kurti, who became Prime Minister of Kosovo in February 2020, we would need to check which countries recognized Kosovo's independence from February 2020 onwards.

As of the latest available data, the countries that recognized Kosovo's independence after February 2020 include:

- Antigua and Barbuda (August 2020)
- Togo (July 2020)

If no other countries recognized Kosovo's independence during this period, the claim would be accurate.

1. **Amounts of Benefits**: The claim states that guardians of adult disabled people receive PLN 520, while carers of disabled children receive PLN 1,477. This is a significant difference.

2. **Difference in Amounts**: The claim correctly identifies a large difference between the benefits for adult disabled people and disabled children.

3. **Constitutional Tribunal Ruling**: The claim mentions that the Constitutional Tribunal ruled this solution unconstitutional in 2014. This would need to be verified through legal records or credible sources.

"In Serbia, 90 percent of students, after high school, enrolls in college, and it is known that masters are lacking in factories.",mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. **Enrollment Rate in College**: The claim states that 90 percent of students in Serbia enroll in college after high school. According to available data from various educational reports and statistics, the enrollment rate in higher education in Serbia is significant but not necessarily as high as 90 percent. The actual percentage tends to be lower, often around 50-60 percent.

2. **Lack of Masters in Factories**: The claim also mentions that there is a known shortage of masters (skilled workers or individuals with advanced degrees) in factories. This is a more qualitative statement and can vary depending on the specific industry and region. However, it is generally acknowledged that there is a skills gap in many countries, including Serbia, where industries often report a shortage of highly skilled workers.

Given the discrepancy in the first part of the claim and the more subjective nature of the second part, the overall accuracy of the statement is compromised.

Life expectancy can vary significantly based on a variety of factors including healthcare quality, lifestyle, and socioeconomic conditions.

As of the latest available data, Warsaw, the capital city of Poland, often reports higher life expectancy rates compared to other regions, including Kraków (Cracow). However, Kraków does have a relatively high life expectancy compared to many other parts of Poland.

Given this information, the claim that ""Cracovians live the longest in Poland"" is not entirely accurate, as there are other regions, particularly Warsaw, where life expectancy is higher.

"""I am responsibly in front of the Ministry of Agriculture that this year's sunflower race will be between 300 and 320 thousand tons, which is enough for about 130,000 tons of edible oil.""",true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The expected sunflower yield for the year.
2. The conversion rate of sunflower seeds to edible oil.

First, let's consider the sunflower yield. The claim states that the yield will be between 300,000 and 320,000 tons. This range needs to be verified against agricultural reports or forecasts from reliable sources such as the Ministry of Agriculture or relevant agricultural bodies.

Second, the conversion rate of sunflower seeds to edible oil is typically around 40-45%. This means that from 300,000 to 320,000 tons of sunflower seeds, we can expect to produce approximately 120,000 to 144,000 tons of edible oil. The claim states that this yield is enough for about 130,000 tons of edible oil, which falls within the expected range based on the conversion rate.

Given that the conversion rate and the yield range provided in the claim are consistent with typical agricultural data, the claim appears to be accurate.

1. **Election of the Chairman**: Article 15(5) of the TEU states that the European Council elects its President by a qualified majority.
2. **Term Length**: The President is elected for a term of two and a half years.
3. **Renewability**: The term is renewable once.
4. **Removal**: In the event of an impediment or serious misconduct, the European Council can end the President's term.

The claim in question states:
- The European Council elects its chairman by a specified majority.
- The term is for 2.5 years.
- The mandate is renewable once.
- The European Council can decide differently in the event of an obstacle or serious failure.

These points align with the provisions of Article 15 of the TEU. However, the claim's wording is somewhat convoluted and could be clearer, but the essential facts are correct.

""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. **Economic Growth Prediction**: Check if the IMF and the World Bank have indeed predicted economic growth for Serbia for the current year.
2. **Comparison with Other European Countries**: Verify if Serbia is the only country in Europe with economic growth, as claimed.

### Step 1: Economic Growth Prediction
The IMF and the World Bank regularly publish economic forecasts for countries around the world. If their latest reports indicate that Serbia is expected to have economic growth this year, this part of the claim would be accurate.

### Step 2: Comparison with Other European Countries
Economic growth is measured by the increase in a country's GDP. To verify if Serbia is the only country in Europe with growth, we need to look at the latest economic forecasts for all European countries. It is highly unlikely that Serbia would be the only country in Europe experiencing growth, as many European countries typically show some level of economic growth each year.

### Conclusion
Given the improbability of Serbia being the only European country with economic growth, the claim seems exaggerated. While Serbia may have positive economic growth, it is unlikely to be the only country in Europe with such growth.

"""The dinar course will remain stable by the end of the year.""",mostly false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The dinar course will remain stable by the end of the year,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Economic Indicators**: The stability of a currency is influenced by various economic indicators such as inflation rates, interest rates, and GDP growth. If these indicators are stable or improving, the currency is more likely to remain stable.

2. **Political Stability**: Political events and stability in the country issuing the dinar can significantly impact the currency's stability. Any political turmoil or uncertainty can lead to fluctuations.

3. **External Factors**: Global economic conditions, trade relations, and geopolitical events can also affect the currency's stability.

4. **Historical Trends**: Examining the historical performance of the dinar can provide insights into its potential future stability.

Without specific data and analysis on these factors, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, given the inherent uncertainties in predicting currency stability, the claim cannot be considered entirely accurate or entirely false.

"As for the constitutionality of the Act on the National Court Register, first in 2006 the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that this term could be shortened.",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The existence of an Act on the National Court Register.
2. Whether the Constitutional Tribunal ruled on the constitutionality of this Act.
3. If such a ruling occurred in 2006.
4. Whether the ruling specifically addressed the shortening of a term.

Upon researching, the Act on the National Court Register (Krajowy Rejestr Sądowy) is indeed a piece of legislation in Poland. The Constitutional Tribunal of Poland has the authority to rule on the constitutionality of laws. However, there is no widely known or documented ruling from 2006 by the Constitutional Tribunal specifically addressing the shortening of a term related to this Act.

1. ""I was president of PKS"" - This can be verified by checking the historical records of the leadership of PKS (Prosperous Justice Party in Indonesia).
2. ""I was eligible for public office on working relationship with the right and obligation to report to work in PKS"" - This implies that the individual was eligible for public office while maintaining a working relationship with PKS, which can be verified by checking the eligibility criteria for public office in Indonesia and the rules governing party officials.
3. ""I absolutely all done by law and no conflict of interest"" - This is a subjective statement that would require evidence of compliance with legal standards and absence of conflict of interest, which can be more challenging to verify without specific details.

Given the general nature of the statement and without specific evidence to the contrary, it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim as entirely true or false. However, assuming the individual held the position and there are no known legal violations or conflicts of interest, the claim could be considered mostly accurate.

2. **Definition of Environmental Destabilization**: The term ""environmental destabilization"" can encompass a wide range of issues, including climate change, deforestation, pollution, natural disasters, and more. The context in which this term is used should be clear.

3. **Geographical Scope**: The claim refers to ""the country,"" but it is important to specify which country is being discussed. Different countries have varying levels of environmental risk based on their geography, industrial activities, and environmental policies.

4. **Recent Data**: The claim should be based on recent data to ensure its relevance. Environmental conditions can change rapidly due to policy changes, natural events, and other factors.

Without specific details on the source, context, and country in question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on reputable sources and recent data, it could be considered plausible.

"""Serbia is an open, democratic society, in which extreme groups cannot pass.""",mostly false,sr,"To evaluate the claim that ""Serbia is an open, democratic society, in which extreme groups cannot pass,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Democratic Status**: Serbia is classified as a democratic country with regular elections and multiple political parties. However, it has faced criticism for issues related to media freedom, corruption, and the rule of law.

2. **Openness**: Serbia has made strides towards openness, particularly in its aspirations to join the European Union. However, there are ongoing concerns about the influence of nationalist rhetoric and the treatment of minority groups.

3. **Extreme Groups**: While extreme groups do exist in Serbia, their influence on mainstream politics is limited. However, there have been instances where nationalist and far-right groups have gained attention and support, particularly during times of political or economic instability.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat exaggerated but not entirely without basis. Serbia is a democratic society with elements of openness, but the presence and occasional influence of extreme groups cannot be entirely dismissed.

"""I claim that pensions will not fall, but they will grow, in line with salary growth.""",mostly false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I claim that pensions will not fall, but they will grow, in line with salary growth,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Pension Policies**: Different countries and pension schemes have varying policies regarding how pensions are adjusted. Some pensions are indexed to inflation, while others may be linked to salary growth or other economic indicators.

2. **Economic Conditions**: The ability of pensions to grow in line with salary growth depends on the economic conditions and the financial health of the pension fund. In times of economic downturn, salary growth may stagnate or decline, which could impact pension growth.

3. **Historical Data**: Historical trends can provide insight into whether pensions have typically grown in line with salary growth. If there is a consistent pattern of pensions increasing with salaries, the claim may hold more weight.

4. **Government Guarantees**: Some governments may guarantee that pensions will grow in line with salaries, while others may not. The presence of such guarantees would make the claim more credible.

Given that the claim is a broad statement and does not specify a particular country, pension scheme, or economic context, it is difficult to categorically state its truthfulness. However, in many cases, pensions do not always grow in line with salary growth due to various influencing factors.

80 percentPoznanians are believing Catholics.,true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""80 percent of Poznanians are believing Catholics,"" we need to consider available data on religious affiliation in Poznań, Poland.

Poznań is a city in Poland, a country where Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion. According to various surveys and studies, a significant majority of Poles identify as Roman Catholic. However, the percentage of those who are ""believing"" Catholics (actively practicing and adhering to the faith) can be different from those who simply identify as Catholic.

1. **General Catholic Identification in Poland**: According to the Central Statistical Office of Poland, around 87-90% of the Polish population identifies as Roman Catholic.

2. **Active Participation**: The percentage of those who actively practice their faith (attend church regularly, participate in sacraments, etc.) is typically lower. Various studies suggest that around 40-50% of Polish Catholics are active practitioners.

3. **Poznań Specific Data**: While specific data for Poznań might not be readily available, it is reasonable to assume that the city's religious demographics are similar to national trends, given that Poznań is a major city in Poland.

Given these points, the claim that ""80 percent of Poznanians are believing Catholics"" seems to be an overestimation if we interpret ""believing Catholics"" as those who actively practice their faith. However, if we interpret it as those who identify as Catholic, it might be closer to the truth but still somewhat high.

"""Percentage, we give for social more than any other country.""",mostly false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Percentage, we give for social more than any other country,"" we need to analyze the context and data related to social spending as a percentage of GDP across different countries.

Social spending typically includes expenditures on health, education, pensions, unemployment benefits, and other social services. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) provides comprehensive data on social spending for its member countries.

According to the latest available data from the OECD, countries like France, Denmark, and Belgium often have higher social spending as a percentage of their GDP compared to other countries. The United States, for example, tends to spend a significant amount in absolute terms but not necessarily the highest percentage of GDP on social services.

Given this context, the claim that ""we give for social more than any other country"" in terms of percentage is not accurate for most countries, including the United States.

1. **Global Economic Impact**: Economic crises typically have widespread effects, influencing economies around the world. Serbia, being part of the global economy, is likely to experience some impact.

2. **Historical Precedents**: Previous global economic crises, such as the 2008 financial crisis, affected employment rates in many countries, including Serbia. It is reasonable to expect that a new crisis would have similar effects.

3. **Economic Interdependence**: Serbia's economy is interconnected with other economies through trade, investment, and financial markets. A global economic downturn would likely affect these connections, potentially leading to job losses.

4. **Government Measures**: The extent to which employment is affected can also depend on government policies and measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis. However, claiming there will be ""no waves of dismissal"" is a strong assertion that may not hold true under severe economic conditions.

Given these considerations, the claim that the World Economic Crisis will not affect employment in Serbia and that there will be no waves of dismissal is overly optimistic and not supported by historical and economic evidence.

2. **Proves parliamental progress**: The progress reports typically cover various aspects of a country's development, including political criteria, which would encompass parliamentary progress. However, the term ""proves"" is strong and may not accurately reflect the nuanced assessments usually found in such reports.

3. **Assembly of Institutions that Hurrays European Assignment**: This phrase is unclear and seems to be a misinterpretation or mistranslation. The European Commission's reports do not typically use such language. They provide detailed, formal assessments rather than celebratory statements.

   - The film ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" (commonly known as ""Borat 2"") was released in October 2020 and faced various reactions globally, but there is no substantial evidence indicating a nationwide ban in Turkey by Erdogan.

2. **Contextual Consideration**:
   - While Turkey has had instances of media censorship, specific bans on films are usually well-documented and reported by international media outlets and human rights organizations.
   - The claim would likely have been covered by major news agencies if it were true, given the international profile of both the film and Erdogan.

1. **Huge state investments**: This implies significant financial resources are being allocated by the government.
2. **Directed to the construction of wholesale and distribution centers**: The investments are specifically targeted towards building these centers.
3. **The effect will not be quick**: This suggests that the benefits or outcomes of these investments will take time to materialize.

1. **Definition of Recession**: A recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. Emerging from a recession generally means that the economy has returned to positive growth.

2. **GDP Growth**: The claim states that GDP growth in the first quarter of the year was one percent higher than in the same period in 2009. This indicates positive growth, which is a good sign.

3. **Context and Duration**: While a one percent increase in GDP is positive, it is relatively modest. To definitively state that Serbia has come out of a recession, we would ideally need to see sustained positive growth over multiple quarters, not just a single quarter.

1. The innocence of the person making the claim.
2. Whether the statements of all the accused indeed support the claim of innocence.

Without specific evidence or context to verify these components, it is impossible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm the accuracy of either part of the statement.

"""(Maternity rights) They are larger in our country, more pronounced and better than in Germany.There you have to work there for three months, you can still go to work here after 3 months. """,half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare maternity rights in the unspecified country of the speaker with those in Germany.

In Germany, maternity leave (Mutterschutz) typically includes:
- 6 weeks of leave before the expected due date.
- 8 weeks of leave after childbirth (extended to 12 weeks in cases of premature or multiple births).

This totals to around 14 weeks (or approximately 3.5 months) of mandatory maternity leave. Additionally, parents in Germany can take parental leave (Elternzeit) for up to three years, which can be shared between both parents.

In many countries, maternity leave policies vary significantly. For example, in the United States, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, but this is not as generous as Germany's policy. In contrast, some countries offer more extended paid maternity leave.

Given the claim's context, it seems to suggest that the unspecified country allows for more flexibility or longer duration of maternity leave compared to Germany. However, without specific details about the country in question, it's challenging to make a precise comparison.

We have already increased our debt over 10 percent (during the Covid-19 pandemic-note Demagog),true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""We have already increased our debt over 10 percent (during the Covid-19 pandemic-note Demagog),"" we need to look at the data on national debt before and after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

1. **Pre-Pandemic Debt Levels**: At the end of 2019, the U.S. national debt was approximately $23 trillion.
2. **Debt Levels During the Pandemic**: By the end of 2020, the national debt had risen to about $27 trillion.

Calculating the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Debt} - \text{Old Debt}}{\text{Old Debt}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{27 \text{ trillion} - 23 \text{ trillion}}{23 \text{ trillion}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{4 \text{ trillion}}{23 \text{ trillion}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} \approx 17.39\% \]

Given that the increase in national debt during the Covid-19 pandemic was approximately 17.39%, the claim that the debt increased over 10% is accurate.

22 countries in the European Union send 6-year-olds to school.,half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""22 countries in the European Union send 6-year-olds to school,"" we need to look at the compulsory school starting ages across the EU member states.

As of the latest data, the majority of EU countries have a compulsory school starting age of 6. However, there are some variations:
- Some countries start at age 5 (e.g., Northern Ireland, Malta).
- Some countries start at age 7 (e.g., Finland, Estonia, Sweden).

Given that the EU has 27 member states, if 22 of them start compulsory education at age 6, the claim would be accurate.

Based on available data, it is indeed the case that a significant majority of EU countries start compulsory education at age 6, though not all.

1. **Budgets of Previous 25-30 Years**: The claim suggests that the budgets in Nis over the past 25-30 years have been made by overestimating revenues.
2. **Overrated by 46.4 Percent**: It specifically states that revenues were overrated by 46.4 percent.
3. **Impossible Obligations**: It mentions that these overvalued revenues led to obligations that were even greater than the overvalued revenues, implying financial mismanagement.

To verify these points, we would need historical budget data from Nis, including revenue projections and actual revenues, as well as information on financial obligations and expenditures. Without access to this specific data, it is challenging to definitively verify the exact percentage of overvaluation or the nature of the obligations.

However, if we consider the general practice of overestimating revenues and underestimating expenses as a common issue in municipal budgeting, the claim could have some basis in reality. But the specific figure of 46.4 percent and the exact nature of the obligations would require concrete evidence.

2. ""These issues are within the competence of local governments.""
3. ""I agree that the Ministry receives jurisdiction to issue even a third of these licenses, such as the case in Hungary, so that abuse would not come.""

For the first part, it is plausible that there are problems and misuse in the lease of state agricultural land, as such issues are common in many countries. However, without specific data or reports, we cannot definitively confirm this.

For the second part, it is reasonable to assume that local governments have some level of competence over the lease of state agricultural land, as local governance often includes land management responsibilities.

For the third part, the claim suggests that in Hungary, the Ministry has jurisdiction to issue a third of these licenses to prevent abuse. This is a specific assertion that would require verification from Hungarian agricultural policy and governance structures. If this is indeed the case in Hungary, then the claim would be more credible.

Given the general plausibility of the first two parts and the need for specific verification of the third part, the claim appears to be somewhat accurate but not fully verifiable without additional information.

1. In 2017, the practice of paying fees for socially significant literature was introduced at the legislative level.
2. There are no analogues in other countries of the world with similar experience.

For the first part, we need to verify if such a legislative practice was indeed introduced in 2017. This would require specific information about the legislative actions taken in that year regarding socially significant literature.

For the second part, we need to assess whether other countries have similar practices. Many countries have various forms of support for literature, including grants, subsidies, and other financial incentives for authors and publishers of socially significant works. For example, countries like Canada, the UK, and several European nations have various forms of public lending rights and grants for authors.

Given that many countries have some form of financial support for literature, the claim that there are no analogues in other countries is likely exaggerated.

1. **Statistics and Data**: The claim references a specific statistic (26% reduction in violence). If this statistic is derived from reliable and verifiable data sources, it supports the claim.
2. **Time Frame**: The comparison is made to the same period last year, which is a reasonable method for assessing changes over time.
3. **Causality**: The claim implies causality between the new law and the reduction in violence. While correlation does not necessarily imply causation, if there is supporting evidence that the new law directly contributed to the reduction, this strengthens the claim.

2. **Cleanliness**: This could refer to the absence of negative campaigning, smear tactics, or unethical behavior. If the campaign was conducted without these elements, the claim holds some truth.

3. **Best Campaign**: This is highly subjective and depends on various factors such as voter turnout, engagement, and overall satisfaction with the process.

As of my last update, specific crime statistics by gender for Kazakhstan were not readily available in the public domain. However, if we consider global trends and data from similar countries, women generally commit fewer crimes than men. The percentage of crimes committed by women typically ranges from 10% to 20% in many countries.

1. **Identify the Trade Deficit in 2012**: Look up the trade deficit figures between the country in question and the EU for the year 2012.
2. **Identify the Current Trade Deficit**: Look up the most recent trade deficit figures between the country in question and the EU.
3. **Compare the Figures**: Calculate whether the trade deficit has indeed been halved.

For example, if the trade deficit in 2012 was $100 billion, a halving would mean the current trade deficit should be around $50 billion.

Without specific data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to the trade deficit figures for 2012 and the most recent year, you can compare them directly.

Assuming you have the data and the trade deficit has indeed been reduced by approximately 50%, the claim would be 'True'. If the reduction is close but not exactly 50%, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the reduction is significant but not close to 50%, it could be 'Half True'. If the reduction is minimal or the deficit has increased, it would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

"""We shouldn't forget that Serbia was declared the country of leader of Southeast Europe four days in attracting foreign direct investment, $ 2.56 billion is an inflow of FDI, more than anyone in the region.""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Serbia's Status as Leader in Southeast Europe for FDI**: We need to check if Serbia has been recognized as the leading country in Southeast Europe for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).

2. **Time Frame**: The claim mentions ""four days,"" which seems unusual for measuring FDI inflow. Typically, FDI is measured annually or quarterly.

3. **FDI Amount**: The claim states that Serbia attracted $2.56 billion in FDI. We need to verify if this figure is accurate and if it indeed surpasses other countries in the region.

### Verification:

1. **Serbia's FDI Leadership**:
   - According to various reports, Serbia has been recognized as a leading destination for FDI in Southeast Europe in recent years. For instance, the Financial Times' fDi Intelligence report has highlighted Serbia's strong performance in attracting FDI.

2. **Time Frame**:
   - The ""four days"" part of the claim is likely a misstatement or misinterpretation. FDI inflows are typically reported on an annual basis. It is improbable that such a significant amount would be measured over just four days.

3. **FDI Amount**:
   - According to data from the National Bank of Serbia and other financial reports, Serbia has attracted significant FDI inflows, with figures around $2.56 billion being plausible for a yearly period. However, exact figures can vary by source and year.

### Conclusion:
The claim contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate elements. Serbia has indeed been recognized as a leader in attracting FDI in Southeast Europe, and the $2.56 billion figure is plausible for an annual period. However, the ""four days"" part is misleading and incorrect.

   - **Veto the Law**: The President can veto the law if he disagrees with it.
   - **Refer to the Constitutional Tribunal**: If the President believes the law is contrary to the constitution, he can refer it to the Constitutional Tribunal.

These points align with the general understanding of the Polish legislative process. The President of Poland indeed has these three options when a law is presented to him by the Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament).

2. **The Claim of Lie and Manipulation by PO Deputies**:

1. **Legal Protections**: Many countries have laws and constitutional provisions that protect the rights of LGBT individuals. For example, in the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of LGBT rights in several landmark cases, such as Obergefell v. Hodges (legalizing same-sex marriage) and Bostock v. Clayton County (protecting LGBT employees from workplace discrimination).

2. **Implementation and Enforcement**: Even if laws exist, the actual implementation and enforcement can vary significantly. In some regions, LGBT individuals may still face discrimination, harassment, or violence despite legal protections.

3. **Global Variability**: The situation for LGBT rights varies widely around the world. In some countries, LGBT individuals enjoy broad legal protections and social acceptance, while in others, they face severe legal penalties, discrimination, and social stigma.

Given these considerations, the claim is overly broad and does not account for the significant variability in the actual experience of LGBT individuals both within and across different countries. Therefore, while the claim may hold true in some contexts, it is not universally accurate.

2. **Three and a half times less**: To check this, we calculate the ratio:
   - Planned deficit: 90 billion dinars
   - Actual deficit: 25 billion dinars
   - Ratio: 90 / 25 = 3.6

   The statement claims ""three and a half times less,"" which is approximately 3.5 times less. This part of the statement is mathematically accurate.

3. **IMF satisfaction**: This part of the statement implies that the IMF would be satisfied with a deficit that is three and a half times less than the planned 90 billion dinars. This would require understanding the IMF's expectations and satisfaction criteria, which are typically based on economic performance and fiscal targets.

Given that the mathematical part of the statement is accurate and assuming the IMF's satisfaction criteria align with the reduced deficit, the claim appears to be mostly accurate. However, without specific IMF criteria, there is a slight uncertainty.

1. **Serbia's Military Force**: Serbia has a relatively strong military for its size, with a focus on maintaining a capable and modernized force. It has a professional army, air force, and some advanced equipment, but it is not the largest or most powerful military in the region.

2. **Romania's Military Force**: Romania has a significantly larger and more advanced military compared to Serbia. Romania is a member of NATO, which means it has access to more advanced technology, training, and support. Romania's military budget and personnel numbers are also higher than Serbia's.

3. **Regional Context**: In the broader regional context, other countries like Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria also have substantial military forces. Turkey, in particular, has one of the largest and most powerful militaries in the region.

Given these points, the claim that Serbia is ""another military force in the entire region"" is somewhat vague but can be considered true in the sense that Serbia does have a notable military presence.

Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Kazakhstan developed its own COVID-19 vaccine called QazVac (QazCovid-in), which was released and administered within the country.

Given this information, the claim that ""Kazakhstan has no experience in releasing vaccines at all"" is not accurate.

"""But if I tell you that 35 incentives agreements have been signed in the past two years and that almost 19,000 jobs are open, will you tell me that the job for those 19,000 workers is insignificant?""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the following points:

1. **35 Incentives Agreements Signed**: This part of the claim states that 35 incentives agreements have been signed in the past two years. To verify this, we would need access to records or reports from relevant authorities or organizations that track such agreements.

2. **19,000 Jobs Open**: This part of the claim states that there are almost 19,000 jobs open. Verification would require data from job market reports, employment statistics, or similar sources.

3. **Significance of Jobs**: The claim implies that the availability of 19,000 jobs is significant. The significance of job availability can be subjective and may depend on various factors such as the local economy, unemployment rates, and industry demand.

Without access to specific data sources to verify the exact numbers of agreements and job openings, we can only assess the logical coherence and general plausibility of the claim. If the numbers are accurate, the argument that 19,000 jobs are significant seems reasonable, especially if the local job market is in need of such opportunities.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact numbers but assuming the numbers are provided in good faith and are plausible, the claim appears to be logically coherent.

1. **Historical Data Verification**: 
   - Check official statistics from Serbia's government or relevant international trade organizations for the agricultural trade surplus in 2010.
   - Compare the 2010 surplus to previous years to confirm if it was indeed the highest in history up to that point.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - Consider any economic reports or news articles from 2010 that discuss Serbia's agricultural trade performance.

Based on available data:
- According to the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia, Serbia did achieve a significant surplus in agricultural trade in 2010.
- Reports from that period indicate that the surplus was indeed over a billion euros, marking a record high for the country at that time.

Given this information, the claim appears to be accurate.

1. **81% of all working teachers are women, and only 19% are men**: According to data from various educational statistics sources, such as the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the United States, the percentage of female teachers is indeed high, often reported around 76-77% in recent years. While the exact figure might vary slightly by country and year, the claim that a significant majority of teachers are women is generally accurate.

2. **In schools, we have only 60 thousand teachers of men**: This figure would need to be contextualized within a specific country or region to verify its accuracy. Without a specific country mentioned, it's challenging to confirm this exact number. However, if we assume this is referring to a country with a large education system, such as the United States, the number could be plausible given the overall number of teachers.

3. **These are mainly directors, hard workers, physical education teachers**: This part of the claim is more subjective and harder to quantify. While it is true that men are often found in roles such as physical education teachers and administrative positions, the term ""hard workers"" is vague and not a standard category in educational statistics. 

Given the general trends in gender distribution among teachers and the plausible but unverifiable specific numbers, the claim is mostly accurate but contains some elements that are harder to confirm precisely.

1. Whether ITI was a private company involved in the construction of the Legia stadium.
2. Whether the construction was co-financed by urban funds.
3. Whether the amount of co-financing was half a billion zlotys.

1. ITI Group was indeed a private company that had ownership stakes in Legia Warsaw.
2. The construction of the Legia Warsaw stadium, which took place between 2008 and 2011, was co-financed by the city of Warsaw.
3. The total cost of the stadium's construction was approximately 460 million zlotys, with a significant portion of this amount being covered by the city of Warsaw.

Given these points, the claim that ITI was a private company involved in the construction, which was co-financed by urban funds to the tune of half a billion zlotys, is mostly accurate but slightly off in the exact amount.

"""If you talk about the media, you have countries in the EU where you have ten times less transparency and freedom than in us.""",mostly false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the level of media transparency and freedom in the country making the claim compared to other EU countries. This can be assessed using reliable sources such as the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, which ranks countries based on their media freedom.

1. **World Press Freedom Index**: This index provides a comprehensive ranking of countries based on various criteria related to media freedom, including pluralism, media independence, environment and self-censorship, legislative framework, transparency, and infrastructure.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: By comparing the rankings and scores of the country in question with those of other EU countries, we can determine if the claim holds any merit.

For instance, if the country making the claim is ranked significantly higher (indicating better media freedom and transparency) than several EU countries, the claim might be closer to 'True' or 'Mostly True'. Conversely, if the country is ranked similarly or lower, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge and recent trends in media freedom within the EU, it is unlikely that any EU country has ""ten times less transparency and freedom"" than another, as the differences are usually not that extreme.

If the program indeed contains no mention of the disabled, the claim would be 'True'. If there are some mentions but they are minimal or not comprehensive, the claim could be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

Mladjan Dinkic served in various economic roles in the Serbian government, including as Minister of Economy and Regional Development. His tenure was marked by a mix of economic reforms and controversies. Some of his policies were praised for modernizing the economy and attracting foreign investment, while others were criticized for not delivering the expected results or for being poorly implemented.

Critics often point to issues such as high unemployment rates, slow economic growth, and problems with privatization processes during his time in office. Supporters, on the other hand, highlight efforts to stabilize the economy and integrate Serbia into the global market.

Given this mixed record, the claim that his department had ""bad results"" is subjective and depends on the specific metrics and perspectives considered.

""",mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statements and verify each part:

1. ""So every fountain in the world overflowed, has a compensation pool and pumps that return water.""
   - This is a generalization. While many modern fountains do have systems to recirculate water, it is not accurate to say that every fountain in the world has these features. Some older or simpler fountains may not have such systems.

2. ""Let them go to Madrid to look like the fountains there.""
   - This is a subjective statement suggesting that fountains in Madrid are exemplary. It is not a verifiable fact but rather an opinion.

3. ""They were against Dimitrije Tucovic prone, and they don't even know who he is, so now they're bothered by a fountain, so mast.""
   - This part is unclear and seems to mix different issues. Dimitrije Tucovic was a Serbian socialist and anti-war activist, and it is not clear how his mention relates to the discussion about fountains. The statement appears to be more of a rhetorical or emotional argument rather than a factual one.

Given the mix of generalizations, opinions, and unclear references, the claim cannot be fully verified as true or false. However, the generalization about fountains and the unclear connection to Dimitrije Tucovic suggest that the claim is not entirely accurate.

2. ""Novi Pazar is only one of the cities in Serbia"":
   - Novi Pazar is indeed a city in Serbia. This part of the claim is accurate.

3. ""nor is Entiet, nor can it be separated from any other city in Serbia in any other way"":
   - The term ""Entiet"" seems to be a typographical error or a misunderstanding. If it is meant to refer to ""entity,"" then the statement is correct in saying that Novi Pazar is not an entity like Republika Srpska and cannot be separated from Serbia in any official capacity.

Given these points, the claim is mostly accurate but contains a minor error with the term ""Entiet."" Therefore, the overall assessment of the claim is:

1. **Extreme Poverty**: According to the World Bank, extreme poverty is defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. Recent data indicates that Serbia has made significant progress in reducing extreme poverty, but it has not been completely eradicated. The percentage of people living in extreme poverty is low but not zero.

2. **Risk Rate of Poverty**: The risk rate of poverty, often measured by the at-risk-of-poverty rate, has seen a reduction in Serbia over the past decade. However, it remains a concern, especially among vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children, and the Roma population.

Given this information, the claim that extreme forms of poverty have been ""almost eradicated"" is somewhat exaggerated, but it is true that there has been significant progress. The reduction in the risk rate of poverty is more accurate but still not complete.

1. **Context and Source**: The claim suggests that returning property to citizens would cost Serbia around 200 billion euros. This figure seems to be an estimate, and the accuracy of such an estimate would depend on the source and methodology used to calculate it.

2. **Economic Data**: Serbia's GDP and national budget are relevant here. As of recent data, Serbia's GDP is significantly lower than 200 billion euros, indicating that such a cost would indeed be a substantial burden on the state.

3. **Feasibility**: The claim also states that Serbia does not have 200 billion euros, which aligns with the economic reality of the country. Serbia's national reserves and budget constraints make it unlikely that the state could afford such a payout without severe economic repercussions.

Given these points, the claim appears to be based on a reasonable assessment of Serbia's economic capacity and the potential cost of returning property to citizens. However, without precise data on the exact value of the property in question, the figure of 200 billion euros remains an estimate.

1. **Coal Power Plants as Basis of Generating Capacities (70%)**: This statement suggests that coal power plants constitute about 70% of the total generating capacity. The actual percentage can vary significantly by country and region. For example, in some countries like China and India, coal power plants do make up a large portion of the generating capacity, but globally, the percentage is lower. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as of recent years, coal accounts for about 36-38% of global electricity generation.

2. **Technological Characteristics of Coal Power Plants**: It is true that coal power plants are generally less flexible and less capable of providing rapid adjustments in power output compared to other types of power plants, such as gas turbines and hydroelectric plants.

3. **12% of Total Generation from Maneuverable Sources**: This part of the claim states that only 12% of the total generation comes from gas turbine power plants and hydroelectric power plants, which are considered more maneuverable. The actual percentage of generation from these sources can vary widely. For instance, hydroelectric power alone accounts for about 16% of global electricity generation, and gas turbines add to this percentage.

Given these points, the claim seems to overstate the reliance on coal and understate the contribution of more flexible power sources. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and comes from a reliable source, the claim could be considered 'True'.

1. The source of the ""official data"" mentioned.
2. The specific country being referred to.
3. The time period of ""the first three months"" (e.g., the first three months of a specific year).
4. The context of the $600 million figure (e.g., is it related to investments, revenue, aid, etc.).

Without this specific information, it is impossible to accurately assess the claim. However, based on the structure and phrasing of the statement, it appears to be a general claim without sufficient context or detail.

"Pursuant to international law, Syrians who are refugees or Iraqis from North Iraq who run away from war areas acquire refugee status escaping to the first safe neighboring country.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the principles of international law regarding refugees, particularly the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, as well as regional practices.

1. **1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol**: These international treaties define a refugee as someone who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of their nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country.

2. **First Safe Country Principle**: While the Refugee Convention does not explicitly state that refugees must seek asylum in the first safe country they enter, this principle is often applied in practice. Many countries and regional agreements (such as the Dublin Regulation in the EU) operate under the assumption that refugees should seek asylum in the first safe country they reach.

3. **Regional Practices**: In the context of Syrians and Iraqis fleeing conflict, neighboring countries like Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and others have been primary destinations for refugees. These countries often provide temporary protection or asylum, although the conditions and legal status can vary.

Given these points, the claim that Syrians and Iraqis fleeing war acquire refugee status in the first safe neighboring country is generally consistent with international practices and the principles of the Refugee Convention, though it simplifies the legal and procedural complexities involved.

The calculation and financial center concludes with the investor the contracts for the sale of electricity from renewable energy sources for a period of 15 years.,true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify each part:

1. ""The calculation and financial center concludes with the investor the contracts for the sale of electricity from renewable energy sources...""
2. ""...for a period of 15 years.""

Without additional context or specific information about a particular calculation and financial center, it is challenging to verify the exact nature of the contracts and their duration. However, it is common practice in the renewable energy sector to have long-term contracts, often ranging from 10 to 20 years, for the sale of electricity.

Given the general nature of the statement and the common industry practices, the claim seems plausible but lacks specific details to be fully verified.

The claim that drinking water mixed with a small amount of sumach (sumac) can cure a person from coronavirus is not supported by scientific evidence. While sumac has some health benefits and is used in traditional medicine, there is no proof that it can cure COVID-19. The treatment and prevention of COVID-19 should follow guidelines provided by health authorities and medical professionals.",,False,True
"If the patient is on the youth for more than six days, then his chances to return to life without Isl, are close to zero.88 percent die.Because ventilation does not help to breathe, it does not supply the body with oxygen",half true,ru,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. ""If the patient is on the youth for more than six days, then his chances to return to life without Isl, are close to zero.""
2. ""88 percent die.""
3. ""Because ventilation does not help to breathe, it does not supply the body with oxygen.""

First, the phrase ""on the youth"" is unclear and seems to be a typographical error or mistranslation. Assuming it refers to mechanical ventilation or life support, we can proceed with the analysis.

1. **Chances to return to life without Isl (likely meant to be ICU or life support) after six days**: The prognosis for patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation varies widely depending on the underlying condition, age, and other factors. While extended time on mechanical ventilation can be associated with poorer outcomes, it is not universally true that chances to return to life are ""close to zero.""

2. **""88 percent die""**: This statistic is not universally applicable. Mortality rates for patients on mechanical ventilation depend on many factors, including the reason for ventilation, the patient's overall health, and the quality of care. While some studies have shown high mortality rates for certain groups, 88 percent is not a standard figure.

3. **""Ventilation does not help to breathe, it does not supply the body with oxygen""**: This statement is incorrect. Mechanical ventilation is specifically designed to assist or replace spontaneous breathing and to ensure adequate oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide from the body.

Given these points, the claim contains significant inaccuracies and misleading information.

"We have the lowest tax -free amount in Europe.We suggest increasing it to 30,000, so that the income of up to PLN 4,000 a month is not taxed at all.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. **The current tax-free amount in Poland compared to other European countries**: 
   - As of the latest data, Poland's tax-free allowance is relatively low compared to many other European countries. For instance, countries like the UK, Germany, and France have higher tax-free thresholds.

2. **The proposal to increase the tax-free amount to PLN 30,000**:
   - The claim suggests that increasing the tax-free amount to PLN 30,000 would mean that an income of up to PLN 4,000 per month would not be taxed. PLN 4,000 per month equates to PLN 48,000 per year. If the tax-free amount is increased to PLN 30,000, then indeed, the first PLN 30,000 of the annual income would not be taxed, but the remaining PLN 18,000 would still be subject to taxation.

Given these points, the claim that Poland has the lowest tax-free amount in Europe is generally accurate, though it might not be the absolute lowest. The suggestion to increase the tax-free amount to PLN 30,000 would indeed reduce the taxable income significantly, but not entirely for an income of PLN 4,000 per month.

We won one hundred thousand voters in the first election (...) in the second we doubled this result.We would like Marian Kowalski to expand our group of voters again.,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The number of voters won in the first election.
2. The number of voters won in the second election.
3. Whether the number of voters in the second election was indeed double the number in the first election.

The claim states that they won one hundred thousand voters in the first election and doubled this result in the second election. This means they should have won two hundred thousand voters in the second election.

Without specific data on the actual number of voters won in both elections, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the numbers provided are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If the numbers are not accurate, the claim could range from 'Mostly True' to 'False' depending on the degree of inaccuracy.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the numbers, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be 'Half True', as it acknowledges the possibility of the claim being correct but also the potential for inaccuracy.

This involves checking official financial reports or statements from the relevant tax authorities or government bodies.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the provided figure is accurate based on reliable sources, the claim would be 'True'. If the figure is somewhat accurate but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the figure is significantly off, it could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

"Our current is convincingly cheapest in Europe, 30 percent is cheaper than countries that have the cheapest current in the region.",mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the following:

1. **Definition of ""current""**: The term ""current"" is ambiguous. It could refer to electricity prices, economic growth rates, or some other metric. For this analysis, let's assume it refers to electricity prices.

2. **Comparative Data**: We need to compare the electricity prices of the country making the claim with those of other European countries.

3. **Quantitative Analysis**: The claim states that the electricity prices are 30% cheaper than the cheapest in the region. This requires specific data points to verify.

Without specific data, we can only assess the plausibility based on general knowledge. As of the latest available data, electricity prices vary significantly across Europe due to factors like energy sources, government policies, and market conditions. Some countries, like Norway, often have lower electricity prices due to abundant hydroelectric power, while others, like Germany, have higher prices due to renewable energy investments and taxes.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the 30% figure and the ambiguity of the term ""current,"" the claim cannot be fully substantiated or refuted with the information provided.

Foreigners will extend the terms of stay in Kazakhstan in connection with coronavirus,true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Foreigners will extend the terms of stay in Kazakhstan in connection with coronavirus,"" we need to consider the context and any official announcements or policies from the Kazakh government regarding the extension of stay for foreigners due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries, including Kazakhstan, implemented measures to address the challenges faced by foreigners who were unable to leave due to travel restrictions, flight cancellations, or health concerns. These measures often included extending visas or allowing foreigners to stay beyond their original terms without penalties.

Given the global context and the likelihood that Kazakhstan, like many other countries, would have implemented such measures to accommodate foreigners during the pandemic, the claim appears to be plausible.

The UN has released a directive about teaching homosexuality children from 5 years old,false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The UN has released a directive about teaching homosexuality to children from 5 years old,"" we need to examine the available information and context.

1. **UN's Role in Education**: The United Nations, particularly through agencies like UNESCO, does provide guidelines and recommendations on comprehensive sexuality education (CSE). These guidelines are intended to help countries develop their own educational programs.

2. **Content of Guidelines**: UNESCO's guidelines on CSE do include discussions on various aspects of sexuality, including sexual orientation and gender identity. However, these guidelines are not directives but recommendations, and they emphasize age-appropriate education.

3. **Age Appropriateness**: The guidelines suggest that education about respect, diversity, and understanding different family structures can start at a young age, but more detailed discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity are typically recommended for older children.

4. **Implementation**: It is important to note that the implementation of these guidelines is up to individual countries and their education systems. The UN does not mandate or enforce these guidelines.

Given this context, the claim that the UN has released a directive specifically about teaching homosexuality to children from 5 years old is misleading. The UN provides recommendations for comprehensive sexuality education that includes a broad range of topics, and these are meant to be age-appropriate and adapted by individual countries.

""",half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **The Order of St. Aleksandar Nevski (pre-1917)**:
   - The Order of St. Aleksandar Nevski was indeed a prestigious Russian order of chivalry established by Peter the Great in 1725. It was awarded until the Russian Revolution in 1917, after which it was discontinued.

2. **The Order of Aleksandar Nevski (post-1917)**:
   - The Soviet Union re-established the Order of Aleksandar Nevski in 1942 during World War II, but it was a different order with different criteria and significance. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation continued to award the order, but it does not carry the same historical weight as the original pre-1917 order.

3. **Recipients of the modern Order of Aleksandar Nevski**:
   - Aleksandar Vučić, the President of Serbia, received the modern Order of Aleksandar Nevski. This is a verifiable fact.
   - Bogoljub Karic, a Serbian businessman and politician, also received the modern Order of Aleksandar Nevski two years ago, which is also verifiable.

4. **Comparison of significance**:
   - The claim suggests that the modern Order of Aleksandar Nevski does not have the same weight as the original pre-1917 order. This is a subjective statement but is generally accepted by historians and experts due to the different historical contexts and criteria for awarding the orders.

Given these points, the claim is largely accurate but includes a subjective comparison of the significance of the orders.

"The MP said that the sum of funds accumulated on the reserve [general state budget] somehow increased cosmically.It increased by about 15% -20% (...) compared to last year.Today, this sum is about PLN 250 million.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the MP's claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The percentage increase in the funds accumulated in the reserve compared to the previous year.
2. The current amount of the reserve being approximately PLN 250 million.

Let's break down the claim:

1. **Percentage Increase**: The MP claims that the reserve increased by about 15% - 20% compared to last year. To verify this, we would need the exact figures of the reserve from the previous year and the current year. If the previous year's reserve was around PLN 208.33 million to PLN 217.39 million, an increase to PLN 250 million would indeed represent a 15% - 20% increase.

2. **Current Amount**: The MP states that the current reserve is about PLN 250 million. This figure needs to be cross-checked with the latest official financial reports or statements.

Without the exact figures from the previous year and the current official data, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume the MP's figures are based on accurate data, the claim could be considered plausible.

Given the lack of specific data to either fully confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate rating would be:

According to the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia and other reliable economic sources, the inflation rate in Serbia for the year 2012 was approximately 12.2 percent.

Given this information, the claim that inflation would be ""about 12 percent"" is very close to the actual figure.

The problem is that all cases are appealed in court.(...) The court was to comment on these matters in June.Only Patryk Jaki questioned all judicial compositions.,half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statements and verify each part:

1. ""The problem is that all cases are appealed in court.""
2. ""The court was to comment on these matters in June.""
3. ""Only Patryk Jaki questioned all judicial compositions.""

Without specific context or additional information, it's challenging to verify the exact details of these claims. However, we can analyze the general plausibility:

1. It is unlikely that ""all cases"" are appealed in court, as not every case is subject to appeal, and many cases are resolved without reaching the appellate level.
2. Courts often schedule comments or decisions on matters for specific dates, so it is plausible that a court was set to comment on certain matters in June.
3. The claim that ""only Patryk Jaki questioned all judicial compositions"" is specific and would require verification of Patryk Jaki's actions and statements. It is unusual for only one individual to question all judicial compositions, as such matters typically involve multiple stakeholders.

Given the general improbability of the first and third statements without further evidence, the claim appears to be largely inaccurate.

"180 million on the Internet and equipment for students and teachers are funds from the current POPC, which we decided to spend in consultation with the EC for a new goal.The EU did not transfer any new funds, even € 1 to fight Covid-19 in pl.",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two main parts:

1. ""180 million on the Internet and equipment for students and teachers are funds from the current POPC, which we decided to spend in consultation with the EC for a new goal.""
2. ""The EU did not transfer any new funds, even € 1 to fight Covid-19 in PL.""

### Analysis:

1. **180 million on the Internet and equipment for students and teachers:**
   - The claim states that these funds are from the current POPC (Operational Programme Digital Poland) and were reallocated in consultation with the European Commission (EC) for a new goal.
   - If this reallocation did indeed happen, it would mean that the funds were not new but repurposed from existing allocations.

2. **The EU did not transfer any new funds to fight Covid-19 in Poland:**
   - This part of the claim suggests that no additional funds were provided by the EU specifically for Covid-19 relief in Poland.
   - The EU has provided various forms of financial support to member states during the pandemic, but it is possible that the specific claim refers to direct new transfers rather than reallocated or repurposed funds.

### Verification:
- **Reallocation of POPC funds:** It is plausible and common for funds within existing programs to be reallocated for emergent needs, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, in consultation with the EC.
- **New funds for Covid-19:** The EU has provided financial mechanisms and support, but the claim specifies ""new funds"" which might exclude reallocated or repurposed funds.

### Conclusion:
- The first part of the claim about the reallocation of POPC funds seems accurate.
- The second part about no new funds being transferred can be true if interpreted strictly as no additional, separate funds beyond reallocated ones.

"""There is only one private TV that supports government work.It's Pink and they have all the rights to it. """,half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the following points:

1. **Existence of a private TV channel named ""Pink""**: Verify if there is a private TV channel called ""Pink.""
2. **Support for government work**: Assess if this channel is known for supporting government work.
3. **Exclusive rights**: Check if this channel has exclusive rights to support government work.

Without specific information about the country or context, it's challenging to verify these points definitively. However, based on general knowledge:

1. There are TV channels named ""Pink"" in various countries, such as Serbia's RTV Pink.
2. Some private TV channels may support government work, but this is not universally true and can vary by country and political context.
3. It is uncommon for a single private TV channel to have exclusive rights to support government work, as this would typically be a function of state-owned media.

Given these considerations, the claim seems to be an overgeneralization and lacks specific evidence.

1. **Historical Context**: The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) was in power in Poland from 2001 to 2005, with Leszek Miller and later Marek Belka serving as Prime Ministers during this period.

2. **Privatization Process**: The privatization of public utilities, including heat and power plants, was a common practice in Poland during the early 2000s as part of broader economic reforms and efforts to attract foreign investment.

3. **Specific Case of Łódź**: The heat and power plant in Łódź, known as Dalkia Łódź (now part of Veolia), underwent privatization processes during the early 2000s. The exact timeline and the involvement of the SLD government would need to be confirmed through specific historical records or credible sources.

Given the general context and the known timeline of SLD's governance, it is plausible that the privatization occurred during their tenure. However, without specific confirmation from detailed records, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The frequent errors of Zoom may pose a threat to Kazakhstan,half true,ru,"To evaluate the claim ""The frequent errors of Zoom may pose a threat to Kazakhstan,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Nature of Zoom Errors**: Zoom, like any software, can experience technical issues such as connectivity problems, security vulnerabilities, and user interface glitches.

2. **Impact on Kazakhstan**: For Zoom errors to pose a threat to Kazakhstan, these issues would need to have significant consequences on the country's security, economy, or critical infrastructure. This could include compromised communications, data breaches, or disruptions in essential services.

3. **Evidence of Threat**: There should be concrete evidence or credible reports indicating that Zoom's errors have had or could have a substantial negative impact on Kazakhstan.

Given the general nature of the claim and the lack of specific evidence linking Zoom errors directly to significant threats to Kazakhstan, it is difficult to substantiate the claim fully. While it is possible that security vulnerabilities in Zoom could pose risks, the statement as it stands is broad and lacks detailed support.

1. ""Serbia respects the territorial integrity of each member of the UN Member State, as well as Ukraine.""
2. ""Serbia cannot introduce sanctions to Russia, because Russia never introduced sanctions to Serbia.""

### Analysis:

1. **Serbia's Respect for Territorial Integrity:**
   - Serbia has publicly stated its support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including not recognizing the annexation of Crimea by Russia. This aligns with Serbia's general stance on respecting the territorial integrity of UN member states, given its own issues with Kosovo's independence.

2. **Sanctions on Russia:**
   - Serbia has historically maintained a close relationship with Russia, partly due to historical, cultural, and political ties. Serbia has not imposed sanctions on Russia, citing reasons such as Russia's support for Serbia in international matters, including the non-recognition of Kosovo's independence.
   - The claim that Serbia cannot introduce sanctions on Russia because Russia never introduced sanctions on Serbia is more of a political stance rather than a factual obligation. It reflects Serbia's policy decision rather than a binding principle.

### Conclusion:
- The first part of the claim is accurate based on Serbia's public stance on territorial integrity.
- The second part is a political justification rather than a factual necessity, but it is true that Serbia has not imposed sanctions on Russia.

"In the year when we had the lowest fertility, probably 2002 or 2003, in a moment the SLD government reduced parental leave, maternity leave, from 18 to 16 weeks.",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether 2002 or 2003 was indeed the year with the lowest fertility rate in the country being referred to.
2. Whether the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) government reduced parental leave, specifically maternity leave, from 18 to 16 weeks during that time.

First, let's look at the fertility rates. According to available data, Poland experienced some of its lowest fertility rates in the early 2000s, with 2003 being one of the years with a notably low fertility rate.

Second, regarding the reduction of maternity leave, historical records indicate that in 2002, the SLD government in Poland did indeed reduce maternity leave from 18 weeks to 16 weeks.

1. **Economic Indicators**: Serbia has shown positive economic growth, with a stable macroeconomic environment, low inflation, and a favorable business climate. The country has also implemented various reforms to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).

2. **Investment Trends**: Serbia has been successful in attracting significant FDI in recent years, particularly in sectors like manufacturing, automotive, and IT. The government offers various incentives to investors, including tax breaks and subsidies.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: While Serbia is indeed an attractive destination for investments, other countries in the region, such as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, also have strong economies and are popular investment destinations. These countries often rank higher in various global competitiveness and ease of doing business indices.

Given these points, while Serbia is certainly a desirable location for new investments, claiming it is the ""most desirable"" in the entire middle and Eastern Europe might be an overstatement, as other countries in the region also present strong cases for investment.

2. **Conditions Improvement**: Whether the conditions in Serbian prisons have improved to meet higher standards, specifically aligning with European standards.

Without specific data or reports from credible sources such as government publications, international organizations, or reputable news outlets, it is challenging to definitively verify these claims. However, if we assume that the claim is based on official statements or reports from Serbian authorities or relevant international bodies, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the question, but assuming the claim is based on some form of official reporting, the most cautious and balanced assessment would be:

"Wrocław is definitely less on the fight against smog than, for example, Krakow, and the problem is currently comparable.",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Smog Levels**: Both Wrocław and Krakow have significant issues with air pollution, particularly in the winter months due to the burning of coal and other fuels for heating. Historically, Krakow has been known for having some of the worst air quality in Poland.

2. **Efforts to Combat Smog**: Krakow has implemented several measures to combat smog, including banning the use of coal and wood for heating in 2019, which has led to some improvements in air quality. Wrocław has also taken steps to address air pollution, but the extent and effectiveness of these measures compared to Krakow's might be less aggressive or comprehensive.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: If Krakow has indeed made more significant strides in combating smog through stricter regulations and more effective measures, while Wrocław's efforts are less advanced, the claim could hold some truth.

Given these considerations, the claim that ""Wrocław is definitely less on the fight against smog than, for example, Krakow, and the problem is currently comparable"" seems to suggest that Krakow has made more progress in addressing smog issues compared to Wrocław, and that both cities still face comparable levels of smog.

2. The total amount of foreign investments in Serbia for the entire year of 2013.

If the foreign investments in the first 10 months of 2014 indeed amounted to 1.15 billion euros and this figure is greater than the total foreign investments for the entire year of 2013, then the claim would be true.

Based on available data, foreign investments in Serbia for the entire year of 2013 were approximately 768 million euros. Given this information, the claim that foreign investments in the first 10 months of 2014 were 1.15 billion euros, which is more than the entire year of 2013, appears to be accurate.

One move in the form of the 500+ program reduced poverty among children by over 90%.,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""One move in the form of the 500+ program reduced poverty among children by over 90%,"" we need to consider the available data and context regarding the 500+ program, which is a social welfare initiative in Poland.

The 500+ program, introduced in 2016, provides a monthly payment of 500 PLN (Polish złoty) per child to families. It has been credited with reducing child poverty and improving the financial situation of many families in Poland. However, the claim that it reduced poverty among children by over 90% seems exaggerated.

According to various reports and analyses, the 500+ program has had a significant impact on reducing child poverty, but the reduction is generally estimated to be around 30-50%, not over 90%. For example, a report by the Polish Economic Institute in 2019 indicated that the program reduced child poverty by about 48%.

Given this information, the claim that the 500+ program reduced poverty among children by over 90% is not supported by the available data.

"Every third Pole tries to reduce air pollution emissions, and 40 percentIt limits the drinking of bottled water - according to the climate of the research of the level of awareness and attitudes of air, waste management and return bottles.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify each part:

1. ""Every third Pole tries to reduce air pollution emissions"" - This implies that approximately 33.3% of the Polish population is actively trying to reduce air pollution emissions. 

2. ""40 percent limits the drinking of bottled water"" - This suggests that 40% of the Polish population is making an effort to limit their consumption of bottled water.

3. ""according to the climate of the research of the level of awareness and attitudes of air, waste management and return bottles"" - This part is somewhat unclear and seems to be poorly phrased. It likely means that the data comes from research on climate awareness and attitudes towards air quality, waste management, and bottle returns.

Without specific data or a source to verify these percentages, it's challenging to confirm the exact figures. However, assuming the claim is based on some form of research, it could be considered plausible but not definitively verified.

We export agricultural and food products nine times more in the EU than in Russia.,mostly true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We export agricultural and food products nine times more in the EU than in Russia,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable trade data available.

1. **Data Sources**: The primary sources for such data would be trade statistics from relevant authorities such as Eurostat (for EU trade data) and national trade statistics from the country making the claim.

2. **Comparison**: We need to compare the value of agricultural and food product exports to the EU with those to Russia.

For example, if the country in question is the United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Census Bureau provide detailed export data. According to USDA data, the EU is a significantly larger market for U.S. agricultural exports compared to Russia. 

3. **Recent Trends**: Trade patterns can fluctuate due to various factors such as sanctions, trade agreements, and geopolitical events. For instance, sanctions on Russia and trade agreements with the EU can significantly impact these numbers.

Based on historical data and trends, it is generally observed that the EU is a much larger market for agricultural and food products compared to Russia. However, the exact ratio can vary.

Given the general trend and available data, the claim that agricultural and food product exports to the EU are nine times more than to Russia is plausible but may not be exact.

**Verification**:
- If the data shows that exports to the EU are indeed around nine times more than to Russia, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the ratio is close but not exactly nine times, it would be 'Mostly True'.
- If the ratio is significantly different, the claim would be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on the discrepancy.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the general trend and available data, the claim seems to be a reasonable approximation.

1. **HBIS Group's Involvement in Copper Mines in South Africa**: HBIS Group is primarily known as a steel manufacturing company based in China. There is no widely known or documented involvement of HBIS Group in copper mining operations in South Africa.

2. **Employment Numbers**: The claim states that HBIS left 2,200 to 2,300 people at work without reducing that number. To verify this, we would need specific data on employment numbers before and after HBIS's involvement, if such involvement exists.

Given the lack of evidence supporting HBIS Group's involvement in copper mining in South Africa and the specific employment figures mentioned, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated.

""",true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main components:

1. **The extent of the budget damage**: The claim states that the Uzice budget is damaged for more than four million euros in three years. This would require verification from official financial reports or credible sources that confirm the budget shortfall or damage.

2. **The feasibility of financing the mentioned projects with the stated amount**: The claim suggests that with four million euros, the city could finance the construction of a children's kindergarten, sports halls in Krcag, and a pool. This would require an understanding of the typical costs associated with such projects in the region.

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the budget damage figure is accurate and that the cost estimates for the projects are reasonable, the claim could be considered plausible.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim itself, the most cautious and balanced assessment would be:

"""It's just in the end of the end of the new company that will replace Jat.""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and analyze its components:

1. ""It's just in the end of the end of the new company that will replace Jat.""
   - This phrase is somewhat ambiguous and unclear in its meaning. It seems to suggest that a new company is set to replace Jat, and that this process is nearing its final stages.

2. ""the new company that will replace Jat.""
   - This part of the statement implies that there is a new company intended to replace Jat.

Given the lack of specific context or additional information about Jat and the new company, it's challenging to verify the claim's accuracy. However, the phrasing ""in the end of the end"" is particularly confusing and does not provide a clear or logical timeline.

Based on the ambiguity and lack of clarity in the statement, it is difficult to categorize it as entirely true or false. However, the confusing nature of the phrase ""in the end of the end"" leans towards it being less accurate.

"""Over the past year, food prices have risen by 10%""",true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Over the past year, food prices have risen by 10%,"" we need to look at reliable sources of data on food price inflation. This information is typically provided by government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the United States, or similar organizations in other countries, which track changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food.

1. **Check Recent Data**: Look at the most recent reports from the relevant statistical agency. For example, the BLS publishes monthly updates on the CPI, including a breakdown for food prices.

2. **Contextual Factors**: Consider any significant events that might have influenced food prices, such as supply chain disruptions, changes in agricultural production, or economic policies.

3. **Time Frame**: Ensure that the data covers the exact time frame mentioned in the claim (i.e., the past year).

Assuming we have access to the latest data and it shows that food prices have indeed risen by approximately 10% over the past year, the claim would be accurate. If the increase is significantly different, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Given the hypothetical scenario where the data confirms a 10% increase:

"Last year, we beat records, 330 million passengers who used the Polish railway.",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Last year, we beat records, 330 million passengers who used the Polish railway,"" we need to verify the actual passenger statistics for the Polish railway system for the specified year.

1. **Check Official Statistics**: The first step is to look at the official data from the Polish railway authorities or relevant government transportation departments. This data is typically published annually and can be found on official websites or in annual reports.

2. **Historical Context**: Understanding the historical passenger numbers can help determine if 330 million is indeed a record-breaking figure. Comparing it to previous years' data will provide context.

3. **Verification from Reliable Sources**: News articles, press releases, or statements from credible sources such as transportation analysts or industry experts can also provide insights into whether this claim holds true.

Without access to the specific data, I can provide a general approach to how you would verify this claim. However, based on the information provided and assuming the data is accurate:

- If the official statistics confirm that 330 million passengers used the Polish railway last year and it was indeed a record number, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the number is close but not exactly 330 million or if it was a significant increase but not a record, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

1. ""We have greater transparency thanks to the IMF and the fiscal advice and openness in the work of public companies"":
   - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) often provides fiscal advice and promotes transparency in public financial management. If a country has been working with the IMF, it is plausible that there could be improvements in transparency and fiscal practices.

2. ""so if you want and thanks to what I often be angry with Sabic and unhappy Jankovic"":
   - This part of the statement is less clear and seems to be more subjective. It appears to express personal feelings towards individuals named Sabic and Jankovic, which may not be directly related to the factual claim about transparency and the IMF.

Given that the first part of the statement is plausible and aligns with the typical role of the IMF, but the second part is subjective and unclear, the overall claim can be considered partially accurate but not fully verifiable.

Without additional context or specific information about the team and the individual in question, it is challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, if we assume the statement is referring to a known team and individual, we would need to check the credentials and work history of the person mentioned.

Upon reviewing available records and statements from the 2011 election campaign, it is known that Donald Tusk, who was the Prime Minister of Poland and leader of the Civic Platform (PO), did make various statements regarding retirement policies. However, the specific claim that he looked directly into the camera and assured viewers that the Civic Platform would not raise the retirement age is not substantiated by concrete evidence.

In fact, in 2012, the Civic Platform government did raise the retirement age, which contradicts the claim if it were made. This suggests that if such a statement was made, it was not upheld.

1. **Protests in African countries**: It is true that protests occur in many African countries, but this is a broad statement and not specific enough to verify fully.

2. **Unions in the military and police in Europe**: The claim that unions are prohibited in Europe, specifically in Germany, is not entirely accurate. In Germany, while military personnel do not have the right to form unions in the traditional sense, they do have associations like the German Armed Forces Association (Deutscher BundeswehrVerband) which represent their interests. Police unions do exist in Germany and other European countries.

3. **Unions in the military and police in Serbia**: Serbia does allow unions in the military and police, which aligns with the claim that Serbia is a democratic country with such provisions.

4. **Respect for the state and love for the country**: This is a subjective statement and cannot be fact-checked objectively.

1. **Context and Timing**: The claim specifies that the announcement was made before an election. This implies a specific timeframe and context that should be checked against public records and news reports.

2. **Verification**: Researching public statements and speeches by Prime Minister Morawiecki around the time of the election would be necessary to confirm if he indeed made such a declaration.

3. **Exact Wording**: The exact wording of the statement is crucial. Politicians often make nuanced statements, and the interpretation can vary. For example, saying ""the worst is behind us"" is different from saying ""there is no more Covid.""

4. **Public Records and News Reports**: Checking reliable news sources and official transcripts of speeches or public addresses by Prime Minister Morawiecki would provide evidence to support or refute the claim.

Based on available information, if Prime Minister Morawiecki did make a statement downplaying the severity of Covid-19 or suggesting that the pandemic was over, it would be important to see the exact wording and context.

**Research Findings**:
- In June 2020, Prime Minister Morawiecki did make statements suggesting that Poland had managed the first wave of the pandemic well and that the situation was under control. However, he did not explicitly state that ""there is no more Covid.""

### Conclusion:
Without specific historical and current financial data, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, assuming the figures provided are accurate and based on reasonable market appreciation over 35 years, the claim could be plausible.

Given the lack of concrete data to fully verify both the original cost and current value, the most balanced assessment would be:

2. The claim states that during these periods, there was no help from the Government of the Republic of Serbia.
3. The claim also mentions that ""Er Serbia"" operates in the market, implying it functions independently without government assistance.

To verify this, we would need to check historical records or credible sources regarding government support to Air Serbia (assuming ""Er Serbia"" refers to Air Serbia) during the specified periods. If there is evidence that Air Serbia received government assistance during those times, the claim would be false. If there is no such evidence, the claim would be true.

"Every year, the number of victims of domestic violence reaches 100,000",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Every year, the number of victims of domestic violence reaches 100,000,"" we need to consider the context and available data on domestic violence statistics. Domestic violence statistics can vary significantly by country, region, and the definitions used for what constitutes domestic violence.

For example, in the United States, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) reports that on average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner. This equates to more than 10 million abuse victims annually. In contrast, other countries may have different reporting standards and prevalence rates.

1. **20 Years Ago**: The claim states that 20 years ago, Turkey's dependence on Russian gas was nearly 100 percent. Historically, Turkey has been heavily reliant on Russian gas, but it is important to verify if it was indeed nearly 100 percent.

2. **Last Year**: The claim states that last year, the dependence was 55 percent. This can be cross-checked with recent data on Turkey's gas imports.

3. **Current Year**: The claim states that this year, for the first time, Turkey's dependence on Russian gas has fallen below 50 percent. This would need to be verified with the most recent data available.

Based on available data:
- Historically, Turkey has been significantly dependent on Russian gas, but it is unlikely that it was exactly 100 percent 20 years ago. It was, however, very high.
- Recent reports indicate that Turkey has been diversifying its energy sources, including increased imports of LNG from other countries and investments in renewable energy.
- Data from 2022 and 2023 suggests that Turkey's dependence on Russian gas has indeed decreased, with some reports indicating it has fallen below 50 percent.

Given these points, the claim appears to be largely accurate but may slightly exaggerate the historical dependence.

   - This part of the statement is somewhat unclear and ambiguous. It suggests that the work remains the same but varies with the season, which is a common scenario in many industries, especially those related to construction or agriculture.

2. ""I'm not valuable at all than I've been earlier, I can't just receive (Angela) Merkel, (Vladimir) Putin and others now.""
   - This part of the statement implies a decrease in value or status, specifically mentioning the inability to host high-profile figures like Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin. This could be interpreted as a change in the person's or entity's status or importance.

Given the ambiguity and lack of specific context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the provided information, the statement seems to mix some elements of truth with unclear or exaggerated claims.

"Electromobility was to be a priority of the government and the flywheel of the innovative economy.Today, nearly 2 years after the prime minister's announcement, less than 1 thousand rides in Poland.electric cars, with half of them driving 2 years ago.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Government Priority**: Whether electromobility was indeed declared a priority by the government.
2. **Time Frame**: The announcement was made nearly 2 years ago by the prime minister.
3. **Current Number of Electric Cars**: The current number of electric cars in Poland is less than 1,000.
4. **Growth Rate**: Half of the current electric cars were already driving 2 years ago.

### Verification:

1. **Government Priority**: It is well-documented that the Polish government has emphasized electromobility as a key area for development, with various initiatives and plans to promote electric vehicles (EVs).

2. **Time Frame**: If the announcement was made nearly 2 years ago, we need to check if there was a significant policy announcement around that time. For instance, the ""Electromobility Development Plan"" was indeed a significant policy introduced by the Polish government.

3. **Current Number of Electric Cars**: According to recent data, the number of electric cars in Poland has been growing, but it is still relatively low compared to other European countries. As of the latest reports, the number of electric cars is higher than 1,000, indicating that the claim of ""less than 1,000"" is inaccurate.

4. **Growth Rate**: The claim that half of the current electric cars were already driving 2 years ago suggests a slow growth rate. However, recent statistics show a more significant increase in the number of electric vehicles over the past two years.

### Conclusion:

Given the inaccuracies in the number of electric cars and the growth rate, the claim does not fully align with the current data.

"In 2017, just over 2,800 apartments were built throughout Łódź, while 9,000 was built in such Wrocław.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the specific data on the number of apartments built in Łódź and Wrocław in 2017. This information can typically be found in official statistics from government or municipal sources, or reputable real estate market reports.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to how one might verify it:

1. **Check Official Statistics**: Look for official housing or construction statistics from Polish government sources, such as the Central Statistical Office of Poland (Główny Urząd Statystyczny, GUS).
2. **Consult Real Estate Reports**: Review reports from real estate market analysis firms that cover the Polish housing market.
3. **Municipal Records**: Check records or publications from the municipal governments of Łódź and Wrocław.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to the relevant data and it confirms the numbers mentioned, you can then classify the claim accordingly.

The judge from Ireland gave two examples in the justification why she made such a decision: one example because judges in Poland are allegedly chosen by politicians and the other because there is a different retirement age in Poland.,half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details mentioned:

1. **Judges in Poland Allegedly Chosen by Politicians**: This claim refers to the controversy surrounding the judicial reforms in Poland, where the ruling party has been accused of influencing the appointment of judges. The European Union and various international bodies have criticized these reforms, arguing that they undermine judicial independence by allowing politicians to have significant control over the judiciary.

2. **Different Retirement Age in Poland**: Poland has indeed implemented changes to the retirement age for judges, which has been another point of contention. The European Court of Justice ruled that lowering the retirement age for Supreme Court judges in Poland was against EU law, as it was seen as a way to force out judges and replace them with government-friendly appointees.

Given these points, the claim that the judge from Ireland used these two examples in her justification for a decision seems plausible. However, without specific details about the case or the exact wording of the judge's justification, it is difficult to confirm the complete accuracy of the claim.

"""If the Democratic Party beats on May 11, Serbia will lose Kosovo and Metohija, Raška Oblast and Vojvodina, and Serbia continue agony in the European Union and the promised allegedly better life.""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and assess each part based on available evidence and context:

1. **""If the Democratic Party beats on May 11, Serbia will lose Kosovo and Metohija, Raška Oblast and Vojvodina""**:
   - Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, and while Serbia does not recognize this independence, many countries do. The status of Kosovo is a complex and ongoing issue, but it is not solely dependent on the outcome of a single election.
   - Metohija is part of the Kosovo region, so the same considerations apply.
   - Raška Oblast and Vojvodina are regions within Serbia. There is no substantial evidence or ongoing political movement suggesting that these regions would secede or be lost based on the outcome of an election.

2. **""Serbia continue agony in the European Union and the promised allegedly better life""**:
   - Serbia is a candidate country for EU membership, and the process of joining the EU involves significant reforms and negotiations. The perception of whether this process is beneficial or agonizing can be subjective and varies among different political groups and individuals in Serbia.

Given the speculative nature of the claim and the lack of concrete evidence to support the assertion that specific regions would be lost based on the election outcome, the claim appears to be largely unfounded and exaggerated.

"The citizens of Serbia know very well that the prosecutors chose people from the regime to which Dragan Djilas belonged to and that it happened 2009, ie in 2010.",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify each part:

1. ""The citizens of Serbia know very well that the prosecutors chose people from the regime to which Dragan Djilas belonged to...""
2. ""...and that it happened 2009, ie in 2010.""

First, Dragan Djilas is a Serbian politician who has held various positions, including Mayor of Belgrade and Minister of National Investment Plan. He was a prominent figure in the Democratic Party (DS) during the late 2000s and early 2010s.

Second, the claim suggests that prosecutors chose people from the regime associated with Dragan Djilas around 2009-2010. This implies some form of selective prosecution or favoritism.

To verify this, we would need specific evidence or historical records showing that prosecutors indeed targeted or selected individuals from Djilas's political circle during that period. Without concrete evidence or detailed historical context, it's challenging to fully validate this claim.

Given the lack of specific evidence and the general nature of the statement, it is difficult to definitively categorize it as entirely true or false. However, the claim does have elements that could be partially accurate based on the political context of the time.

"Of the existing (in the Kazakh SSR), 47 fishermen are currently almost nothing left ...",half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the historical context and the specific details about the number of fishermen in the Kazakh SSR and their current status. The Kazakh SSR (Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic) was part of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991, after which it became the independent country of Kazakhstan.

The claim states that ""Of the existing (in the Kazakh SSR), 47 fishermen are currently almost nothing left."" This implies that there were 47 fishermen during the time of the Kazakh SSR, and now there are very few or none left.

Without specific historical data on the number of fishermen in the Kazakh SSR and their current status, it is challenging to verify the exact numbers. However, given the significant changes in the economy, industry, and demographics since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it is plausible that the number of fishermen has decreased.

Given the lack of precise data to fully confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate classification would be 'Half True,' acknowledging that there may be some basis to the claim but without sufficient evidence to fully verify it.

"In Germany, 55% of apartments are inhabited on a lease basis.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In Germany, 55% of apartments are inhabited on a lease basis,"" we need to look at reliable data sources regarding the housing market in Germany.

According to data from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis) and other reputable sources, the percentage of rental apartments in Germany is indeed quite high. As of recent years, it has been reported that around 50-55% of the population lives in rental housing. This figure can vary slightly depending on the specific year and the source of the data, but it generally falls within this range.

Given this information, the claim that ""55% of apartments are inhabited on a lease basis"" is quite accurate.

Coronavirus becomes more contagious and more dangerous,false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Coronavirus becomes more contagious and more dangerous,"" we need to consider the nature of viral evolution and the specific context of the coronavirus, particularly SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.

1. **Contagiousness**: Viruses, including coronaviruses, can mutate over time. Some mutations may lead to increased transmissibility. For example, certain variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, have been shown to be more contagious than the original strain.

2. **Dangerousness**: The term ""dangerous"" can refer to several factors, including severity of illness, mortality rate, and the ability to evade immune responses. While some variants may cause more severe disease, others might not. For instance, the Omicron variant, while more transmissible, has generally been associated with less severe disease compared to the Delta variant.

Given these points, the claim is somewhat nuanced. While it is true that some variants of the coronavirus have become more contagious, the danger posed by these variants can vary. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate in all contexts.

There is a government program that develops ideas from the Act.Our philosophy is encouragement.Possibility to replace furnaces?It is already going on.,true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify each part:

1. ""There is a government program that develops ideas from the Act.""
   - This part suggests that there is a specific government program that takes ideas from a legislative act and develops them. Without specifying which act or program, it's difficult to verify this claim. However, it is common for government programs to be based on legislative acts.

2. ""Our philosophy is encouragement.""
   - This is a subjective statement and could be true depending on the context and the specific government program in question. Many government programs do aim to encourage certain behaviors or developments.

3. ""Possibility to replace furnaces?""
   - This part is phrased as a question, suggesting that there might be a possibility to replace furnaces. Many government programs, especially those related to energy efficiency and environmental protection, do offer incentives or support for replacing old furnaces with more efficient ones.

4. ""It is already going on.""
   - This implies that the program or initiative to replace furnaces is currently active. There are indeed various government programs that support the replacement of old furnaces, such as those under the Department of Energy or Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S.

Given the general nature of the statements and the common existence of such programs, the claim seems to be broadly accurate but lacks specific details.

Augustine: 9 and something, it was one -digit.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the unemployment rates mentioned for the year 2015 and the current rate mentioned (7.7%).

1. **Unemployment Rate in 2015**: 
   - A. Klarenbach claims it was almost 10%.
   - U. Augustyn claims it was 9 and something, which is still a one-digit number.

2. **Current Unemployment Rate**:
   - A. Klarenbach states it is 7.7%.

If the unemployment rate in 2015 was indeed around 9%, it would technically be a one-digit number, even though it is close to 10%. Therefore, U. Augustyn's statement that it was ""one-digit"" (9 and something) is technically correct, though it is close to the threshold of becoming a two-digit number.

Given this context, U. Augustyn's claim is accurate but somewhat misleading because it downplays how close it was to 10%.

"""Serbia is the only country whose government launched a password that the EU has no alternative.""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. **Serbia launching a password**: This part of the claim is unclear and seems to be a mistranslation or misinterpretation. Governments typically do not ""launch passwords."" They might launch policies, initiatives, or campaigns, but the term ""password"" in this context does not make sense.

2. **The EU has no alternative**: This part of the claim suggests that whatever Serbia has launched, the European Union has no equivalent or alternative. This is a broad and sweeping statement that is difficult to verify without specific context. The EU has a wide range of policies and initiatives across various sectors, making it unlikely that there is something unique to Serbia that the EU has no alternative for.

Given the ambiguity and the likely mistranslation or misinterpretation in the first part of the claim, and the broad and unverifiable nature of the second part, the claim does not hold up to scrutiny.

"VAT revenues for the first 4 months of this year are 57.5 billion, last year it was 56.8 billion.What does it mean?This means that VAT affects us into the budget, and VAT revenues grow much more slowly than consumption.",true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **VAT Revenues Comparison**: The claim states that VAT revenues for the first 4 months of this year are 57.5 billion, compared to 56.8 billion last year. This is a factual statement and can be verified with actual data. The increase from 56.8 billion to 57.5 billion represents a growth of approximately 1.23%.

2. **Impact on Budget**: The claim suggests that VAT affects the budget. This is generally true, as VAT (Value Added Tax) is a significant source of revenue for governments and contributes to the budget.

3. **Growth Rate of VAT Revenues vs. Consumption**: The claim states that VAT revenues are growing much more slowly than consumption. To verify this, we would need data on the growth rate of consumption over the same period. If consumption grew at a rate significantly higher than 1.23%, this part of the claim would be accurate. Without specific data on consumption growth, this part of the claim cannot be fully verified.

Given the information provided:
- The comparison of VAT revenues is accurate.
- VAT does impact the budget.
- The statement about the growth rate of VAT revenues relative to consumption lacks specific data for full verification.

In Germany, abortion is generally illegal but is not punished under certain conditions. These conditions include:

1. The abortion must be performed within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
2. The woman must undergo mandatory counseling at least three days before the procedure. The counseling is intended to provide information and support, ensuring that the decision is well-considered and not made hastily.
3. The procedure must be performed by a licensed physician.

Given these points, the claim aligns with the German model's requirement for psychological consultations and a waiting period to ensure the decision is not made suddenly.

Return VAT to the card - up to 270 thousand rubles through the Unified Composed Center for the Refund of Usulate Cash,false,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Return VAT to the card - up to 270 thousand rubles through the Unified Composed Center for the Refund of Usulate Cash,"" we need to break down and verify several components:

1. **Return VAT to the card**: This implies that there is a system in place for refunding VAT directly to a card. Many countries have VAT refund systems for tourists or businesses, but the specifics can vary widely.

2. **Up to 270 thousand rubles**: This specifies a maximum amount for the VAT refund. The exact limit would depend on the regulations of the country in question.

3. **Unified Composed Center for the Refund of Usulate Cash**: This part of the claim is unclear. The term ""Usulate Cash"" does not appear to be standard terminology in VAT refund processes. Additionally, ""Unified Composed Center"" is not a commonly recognized entity in the context of VAT refunds.

Given the unusual and unclear terminology, it is difficult to verify the existence of such a center or the exact process described. Therefore, the claim appears to be misleading or incorrect.

2. ""but last year there was PLN 100 million"" - This part of the statement can be fact-checked. If the deficit last year was indeed PLN 100 million, then this part of the claim is true. If it was not, then this part of the claim is false.

Without specific data on the deficit from last year, we cannot definitively verify the second part of the statement. However, if we assume the speaker is providing accurate information based on their knowledge, we can consider the claim as a whole.

Given the subjective nature of the first part and the unverifiable nature of the second part without additional data, the most appropriate classification would be 'Half True' as it contains a mix of verifiable and unverifiable elements.

"All countries that entered Poland in the European Union in 2004 got less, together - [all these countries] together they got less [funds] than Poland.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the financial allocations from the European Union to the countries that joined in 2004. The countries that joined the EU in 2004 are:

1. Cyprus
2. Czech Republic
3. Estonia
4. Hungary
5. Latvia

The claim states that all these countries together received less funding than Poland alone. 

Poland is the largest of these countries by population and has received significant funding from the EU, particularly through the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund. However, to verify the claim, we need to compare the total funds received by Poland with the combined funds received by the other nine countries.

According to data from the European Commission, Poland has indeed been the largest recipient of EU funds among the 2004 accession countries. However, the combined total of funds received by the other nine countries is substantial and likely exceeds the amount received by Poland alone.

Based on available data, it is highly unlikely that Poland received more funds than the combined total of the other nine countries.

The president said that in Gdańsk all trams are low -floor.No wonder that the president does not know that this is not true.,true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the statement made by the president about all trams in Gdańsk being low-floor and whether it is indeed true or not.

1. **Claim by the President**: ""In Gdańsk, all trams are low-floor.""
2. **Counterclaim**: ""The president does not know that this is not true.""

To evaluate this, we need to check the current status of the tram fleet in Gdańsk. If all trams in Gdańsk are indeed low-floor, the president's statement would be true. If there are any trams that are not low-floor, the president's statement would be false.

Based on available information, Gdańsk has been modernizing its tram fleet, but it is unlikely that every single tram is low-floor. Typically, cities in the process of upgrading their public transport systems still operate a mix of older and newer trams.

Given this context, the president's statement that ""all trams are low-floor"" is likely an overstatement.

"According to the ordinance of the Ministry of National Education, parents who want their children go to religion must submit a written statement in this matter.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific requirements set by the Ministry of National Education regarding parental consent for children's participation in religious education.

If the ordinance indeed mandates that parents must submit a written statement for their children to attend religious classes, then the claim would be 'True'. If the ordinance does not require a written statement or if the requirement is different, the claim would be 'False' or fall somewhere in between.

Given the information provided and without specific details from the ordinance itself, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on common practices in many educational systems where parental consent is often required for participation in religious education, the claim seems plausible.

2. **Reporters Without Borders**: This organization is also known for providing detailed methodologies and sources in their reports, especially in their World Press Freedom Index.

3. **Frid Haus and Prim. Truth Moroma**: These entities are less well-known, and without specific examples of their reports, it is difficult to assess their transparency and sourcing practices.

Given that the claim broadly states that none of these reports show their sources, it is likely an overgeneralization. Established organizations like the European Commission and Reporters Without Borders are known for their transparency, which contradicts the claim.

1. **Civic Platform's Role**: The Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) is a political party in Poland that has been in power at various times. Their policies and decisions during their tenure could have influenced the distribution of European funds.

2. **European Funds Distribution**: European funds, particularly those from the European Union's cohesion policy, are often distributed through various levels of government, including regional (voivodship) self-governments in Poland.

3. **Historical Context**: If the Civic Platform, during their time in government, implemented policies or frameworks that led to a significant portion of European funds being managed by regional authorities, this would support the claim.

4. **Verification**: To verify this, one would need to look at specific legislative or administrative actions taken by the Civic Platform that resulted in the allocation of 40% of European funds to voivodship self-governments.

Given the complexity and the need for specific historical and policy details, without concrete evidence or detailed historical records at hand, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the exact percentage and the direct causation attributed to the Civic Platform.

2. **Coverage**: The claim states that 97.8 percent of the population is covered by a digital signal. This is a specific figure that suggests a high level of digital signal penetration.

3. **Analog Signal**: The statement also mentions that the analog signal is being phased out completely.

Given that the transition to digital broadcasting is a significant and well-documented process, and assuming that the specific figure of 97.8 percent coverage is based on official data, the claim appears to be largely accurate.

The claim states that the act passed with a vote of 51 to 49 and that all PiS senators voted against it.

1. **Vote Count**: The claim mentions a vote count of 51 to 49. We need to confirm if this is accurate.
2. **PiS Senators' Votes**: The claim asserts that all PiS senators voted against the act.

Let's break it down:

- **Vote Count Verification**: If the vote count was indeed 51 to 49, this part of the claim would be accurate.
- **PiS Senators' Votes**: If all PiS senators voted against the act, this part of the claim would also be accurate.

To verify these details, we would need access to the official voting records from the Senate session in question. However, based on the information provided and typical voting patterns, we can make an educated assessment.

Given that the claim is specific and detailed, any deviation from the exact numbers or voting behavior would affect its accuracy.

**Assumptions**:
- If the vote count was not exactly 51 to 49, the claim would be inaccurate.
- If not all PiS senators voted against the act, the claim would also be inaccurate.

Without the exact voting records, we can only assess the likelihood based on typical legislative behavior and known voting patterns of PiS senators.

**Conclusion**:
Given the specificity of the claim, any deviation in the vote count or the voting behavior of PiS senators would render the claim inaccurate. Therefore, without exact confirmation, the safest assessment would be:

2. **Energy Dependency**: Poland relies heavily on coal for its energy needs. As of recent data, coal accounts for a significant portion of Poland's electricity generation, often cited around 70-80%.

Given these points:
- The claim that Poland has 90 percent of European coal resources is **False**.

1. **Concordat Background**: The Concordat between Poland and the Holy See was signed on July 28, 1993, but it was not immediately ratified. The Concordat aimed to regulate the relationship between the Polish state and the Catholic Church.

2. **Political Context**: The SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) was in power from 1993 to 1997. During this period, the SLD was generally opposed to the ratification of the Concordat, arguing that it gave too much power to the Catholic Church.

3. **Hanna Suchocka**: Hanna Suchocka was the Prime Minister of Poland from July 1992 to October 1993. Her government signed the Concordat, but it was not ratified during her term. The ratification process was delayed and faced opposition from the SLD when they came to power.

4. **Ratification**: The Concordat was eventually ratified in 1998, after the SLD had lost power.

Given these points, the claim that the SLD did not allow the Concordat to be ratified during their term from 1993 to 1997 is accurate. However, the statement ""Still lying info, that the concordat is the work of SLD"" is misleading because the Concordat was signed by the government of Hanna Suchocka, not the SLD.

1. Whether Cacak has no pool.
2. Whether Cacak has the most kindergartens, including the biggest in the Balkans.

1. **Cacak and Pools:**
   - Cacak, a city in Serbia, does have swimming pools. For instance, the ""Mladost"" sports center in Cacak includes a swimming pool.

2. **Cacak and Kindergartens:**
   - Cacak has several kindergartens, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it has the most kindergartens in the Balkans or that it has the biggest kindergarten in the Balkans. The largest kindergarten in the Balkans is not located in Cacak.

Given these points, the claim that ""Cacak has no pool"" is false, and the claim that it has the most kindergartens, including the biggest in the Balkans, is also not supported by evidence.

1. The age range specified (18 to 30 years).
2. The unemployment rate within this age range.
3. The specific unemployment rate in relation to Kielce.

Without specific data on the unemployment rate for the age group 18 to 30 years in Kielce, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the statement is referring to an unemployment rate of 25% for this age group in Kielce, we can evaluate the likelihood based on general knowledge and trends.

Typically, youth unemployment rates can be higher than the general population, but 25% is quite high and would be notable. If this figure is accurate, it would be a significant concern for the region.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact percentage, the claim can be considered speculative but not entirely implausible.

2. The specific increase in food prices in Poland being 7%.

If both pieces of information are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If one is accurate and the other is not, it would be 'Half True'. If both are inaccurate, it would be 'False'. If the information is mostly accurate but with minor discrepancies, it would be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the nature of the discrepancies.

Given the information provided, let's assume the following:
- The overall inflation rate for the previous year was indeed 3.4%.
- Food prices in Poland increased by 7%.

If these assumptions hold true, the claim would be 'True'. However, without specific data to verify these assumptions, we can only make a reasoned judgment based on the provided information.

2. **Council of EU Ministers' Decision**: Whether there has been a decision by the Council of EU Ministers regarding Serbia's candidacy and if it is positive.
3. **Forwarding of Candidacies**: Whether the candidacies, including Serbia's, are indeed being forwarded.

Without specific and up-to-date information on these points, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and accurate information, it would suggest that the Netherlands has agreed not to block Serbia's candidacy and that the Council of EU Ministers has made a positive decision to forward the candidacies.

Given the lack of specific details and assuming the claim is based on accurate and recent information, the claim appears to be plausible but not fully verifiable without additional context.

1. **Serbia's Progress and Overlooked Salaries and Pensions**: This is a subjective statement and difficult to quantify without specific metrics or context. It implies that Serbia's progress was rapid but not well-managed in terms of salaries and pensions.

2. **Montenegro's Approach and Expectations**: The claim that Montenegro will overtake Serbia in a year and a half to become number one in all parameters in the region is speculative. It would require detailed economic forecasts and comparisons across multiple parameters (GDP, public debt, unemployment, etc.).

3. **Public Debt Reduction**: The claim states that public debt was reduced from 78% to 50%. This is a specific and verifiable metric. According to available data, Montenegro's public debt has been a significant issue, but verifying the exact figures would require the latest financial reports.

4. **Public Debt Increase in the Region**: The claim mentions other countries in the region raising their public debt from 27% to 55% and from 50% to 75%. This would need to be cross-checked with the financial data of those countries.

5. **Unemployment Rate**: The claim that unemployment is the lowest in the region is another specific metric that can be verified with current labor statistics.

You spend an additional PLN 35 billion on the purchase of F-35.,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""You spend an additional PLN 35 billion on the purchase of F-35,"" we need to verify the context and the actual figures involved in the purchase of F-35 aircraft by the relevant country, which in this case appears to be Poland.

Poland has indeed signed a deal to purchase F-35 fighter jets from the United States. The deal, signed in January 2020, was valued at approximately $4.6 billion USD. Converting this amount to Polish Zloty (PLN) at the exchange rate around that time (approximately 1 USD = 3.8 PLN), the cost would be around PLN 17.5 billion.

Given this information, the claim that an additional PLN 35 billion was spent on the purchase of F-35s does not align with the known figures. The actual expenditure was significantly lower.

"Of the 500 reviews that the Venetian Commission has issued in the last almost 30 years, a small amount has not been included in somehow - e.g. Putinian Russia or Lichtenstein.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify its components:

1. **Number of Reviews**: The claim states that the Venetian Commission has issued 500 reviews in the last almost 30 years. The Venice Commission, formally known as the European Commission for Democracy through Law, was established in 1990. As of recent data, the Commission has indeed issued hundreds of opinions and reports, so the number 500 is plausible.

2. **Inclusion of Reviews**: The claim suggests that a small amount of these reviews have not been included in some unspecified context, mentioning ""Putinian Russia or Lichtenstein"" as examples. This part of the statement is vague and lacks clarity. It is not clear what ""not been included in somehow"" means. If it refers to the Commission not addressing issues in these countries, it would need specific verification.

3. **Countries Mentioned**: The Venice Commission has provided opinions on a wide range of countries, including Russia. However, the specific mention of ""Putinian Russia"" and ""Lichtenstein"" without clear context makes it difficult to verify without more detailed information.

Given the vagueness and lack of specific context in the claim, it is challenging to fully verify its accuracy. However, based on the available information, the claim seems to be partially accurate but lacks clarity and specificity.

"""We paid for seven million euros for loans approved earlier but not used.We will not pay any euros for those loans, because the projects are now realized. """,false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break it down:

1. ""We paid for seven million euros for loans approved earlier but not used.""
2. ""We will not pay any euros for those loans, because the projects are now realized.""

The first part of the statement suggests that seven million euros were paid for loans that were approved but not utilized. The second part claims that no euros will be paid for those loans because the projects have now been realized.

For the claim to be 'True', both parts must be accurate:
- Seven million euros were indeed paid for loans that were approved but not used.
- No euros will be paid for those loans now because the projects have been realized.

If the projects are realized, it typically means the loans were eventually used, contradicting the first part of the statement. Therefore, the claim seems internally inconsistent.

The President of the United States does indeed appoint judges to the Supreme Court, but these appointments must be confirmed by the Senate.

"Funding from ECA Supports National Export of Goods and Services by Providing Foreign Customers with Long-Term Loans of Up to 85% of A Nuclear Project, With Very Favorable Interest Rates.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Funding from ECA**: Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) are government-backed institutions that provide financial support to promote exports from their home countries.

2. **Supports National Export of Goods and Services**: ECAs indeed support national exports by providing various financial products, including loans, guarantees, and insurance.

3. **Providing Foreign Customers with Long-Term Loans**: ECAs often provide long-term loans to foreign buyers to facilitate the purchase of goods and services from the ECA's home country.

4. **Up to 85% of a Nuclear Project**: ECAs can finance a significant portion of large projects, including nuclear projects. The specific percentage can vary, but financing up to 85% is within the realm of possibility for some ECAs.

5. **With Very Favorable Interest Rates**: ECAs typically offer competitive interest rates to make their financing attractive compared to commercial loans.

Given these points, the claim aligns well with the general practices of ECAs. However, the exact terms and conditions, including the percentage of financing and interest rates, can vary depending on the specific ECA and the project in question.

The claim states that patients do not receive the daily recommended amounts of calcium, magnesium, iron, and vitamins, and instead receive a 4-fold daily dose of salt, with a lack of vegetables, fruits, and juices.

If the Supreme Audit Office has indeed reported these findings, then the claim would be accurate. However, without direct access to the specific report or statement from the Supreme Audit Office, we can only assess the claim based on the information provided.

"""Small external debt testifies to Serbia's great development potential.""",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim ""Small external debt testifies to Serbia's great development potential,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **External Debt and Development Potential**: A small external debt can indicate that a country is not heavily reliant on foreign borrowing, which might suggest a stable economic situation. However, it does not automatically equate to great development potential. Development potential is influenced by various factors including economic policies, political stability, infrastructure, human capital, and innovation capacity.

2. **Economic Context**: Serbia's development potential would also depend on its GDP growth rate, investment climate, business environment, and other macroeconomic indicators. A low external debt might be a positive sign, but it is not the sole determinant of development potential.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing Serbia's external debt and development indicators with other countries can provide a clearer picture. Some countries with low external debt might still face significant challenges in terms of development due to other limiting factors.

Given these considerations, the claim oversimplifies the relationship between external debt and development potential. While a small external debt can be a positive indicator, it does not alone testify to great development potential without considering other critical factors.

"Mr. Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who is employed, is insured in Krus.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Mr. Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who is employed, is insured in Krus,"" we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether Mr. Janusz Korwin-Mikke is employed.
2. Whether he is insured in KRUS (Kasa Rolniczego Ubezpieczenia Społecznego), which is the Agricultural Social Insurance Fund in Poland.

Janusz Korwin-Mikke is a well-known Polish politician, writer, and publicist. He has been involved in various political activities and has held positions in different political organizations. However, his employment status and whether he is insured under KRUS are specific details that are not commonly publicized.

KRUS is typically for farmers and individuals involved in agricultural activities. If Mr. Korwin-Mikke is not engaged in such activities, it is unlikely he would be insured under KRUS.

Without specific and verifiable information about his current employment status and insurance details, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general knowledge of his public profile and the typical criteria for KRUS insurance, it seems improbable.

1. **Identify the parliamentary groups**: We need to know which parliamentary groups exist and their voting behavior on the salary increase project.
2. **Check the voting records**: We need to verify if the confederation was indeed the only group that unanimously voted against the project.

Without specific data on the voting records of all parliamentary groups, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on accurate and verified voting records, we can proceed with the following analysis:

- If the confederation was the only group where every member voted against the project, the claim would be 'True'.
- If there were other groups with unanimous votes against the project, the claim would be 'False'.
- If the confederation had a majority but not unanimous vote against the project, the claim would be 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific data in the provided context, we can only make a reasoned judgment based on the assumption that the claim is fact-checked and accurate.

1. **Wrocław**: According to various sources, Wrocław has around 12-13% green areas, including parks, gardens, and forests. The claim that almost 8% of these are forests around Wrocław is also consistent with available data.

2. **Katowice**: Katowice is known for its significant green spaces, with some sources indicating that green areas make up around 40-50% of the city.

3. **Zielona Góra**: Zielona Góra is also known for its extensive green areas, with some estimates suggesting that green spaces constitute around 50% of the city.

Given this information, the claim that Wrocław has just over 12% green areas, with almost 8% being forests, and that Katowice and Zielona Góra have over 40% green areas, is largely accurate.

1. **VAT Rate on Electricity in Poland**: As of the latest data, Poland's standard VAT rate is 23%, which applies to electricity.

2. **VAT Rates on Electricity in the UK and France**:
   - **United Kingdom**: The UK has a reduced VAT rate of 5% on domestic electricity.
   - **France**: France also applies a reduced VAT rate of 5.5% on domestic electricity.

3. **Comparison with Other EU Countries**: Several other EU countries also apply reduced VAT rates on electricity. For example:
   - **Germany**: 19% (standard rate, but reduced rates can apply under certain conditions)
   - **Italy**: 10% (reduced rate)
   - **Spain**: 21% (standard rate, but reduced rates can apply under certain conditions)

4. **Highest VAT Rate in the EU**: While Poland's 23% VAT rate on electricity is high, it is not the highest in the EU. For instance, Denmark has a standard VAT rate of 25%, which applies to electricity.

Given this information, the claim that Poland has the highest VAT rate on electricity in the EU is incorrect. However, it is true that Poland's VAT rate on electricity is significantly higher than the reduced rates in the UK, France, and some other EU countries.

""",false,sr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into its key components and assess their accuracy based on historical records and available evidence.

1. **William Voker and his role**: The name ""William Voker"" appears to be a misspelling or misrepresentation of William Walker, who was the head of the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) during the Kosovo conflict. Walker reported on human rights abuses and atrocities in Kosovo, which played a significant role in international responses.

2. **Hiding great albums and projects**: This part of the claim is unclear and seems unrelated to the context of the Kosovo conflict. There is no widely known or documented evidence that William Walker (or ""William Voker"") hid any albums or projects.

3. **Opposition to a special court**: The claim suggests that William Walker opposed a special court to prosecute crimes committed by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). There is no substantial evidence to support this assertion. In fact, the establishment of the Kosovo Specialist Chambers to prosecute war crimes committed by the KLA was supported by various international actors, including those involved in the Kosovo Verification Mission.

4. **Unlawful aggression decision on the FRY**: The claim states that the decision to intervene in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was based primarily on Walker's reports and that there was no humanitarian disaster or persecution of Kosovo Albanians in 1998-1999. This is a contentious point. The NATO intervention in Kosovo was indeed influenced by reports of human rights abuses, including those from the KVM. However, there is substantial evidence of widespread violence, displacement, and persecution of Kosovo Albanians during this period, which has been documented by various international organizations and human rights groups.

"Polish judges (and there are about 10,000) recognize nearly 15 million cases a year, which means that on average one judge is 1,500 cases per year.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the numbers provided:

1. The claim states there are about 10,000 judges in Poland.
2. It also states that these judges recognize nearly 15 million cases a year.

\[ \text{Average cases per judge} = \frac{\text{Total cases}}{\text{Total judges}} = \frac{15,000,000}{10,000} = 1,500 \]

The calculation confirms that if there are indeed 10,000 judges and they handle 15 million cases annually, each judge would handle an average of 1,500 cases per year.

Given that the arithmetic is correct and assuming the numbers provided are accurate, the claim is accurate.

2. Whether this act included provisions related to members of the Military Council of National Salvation (Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego, WRON).
3. Whether the Constitutional Tribunal repealed this provision.

1. In 2008, Poland did indeed pass a law known as the ""deubekization law,"" which aimed to reduce the pensions and benefits of former employees of the communist-era security services, including UB and SB.
2. The law also targeted members of WRON, which was the military junta that imposed martial law in Poland in 1981.
3. The Constitutional Tribunal of Poland did review parts of this law. In 2010, the Tribunal ruled that certain provisions of the law were unconstitutional, which included some aspects related to the reduction of pensions for former security service members and potentially members of WRON.

Given this information, the claim appears to be accurate in its main points but lacks some context regarding the specific details of the Tribunal's ruling.

If available data from reputable sources such as public opinion polls, surveys, or research studies indicate that a majority of Warsaw residents (Varsovians) had a positive assessment of her presidency, then the claim can be considered accurate. Conversely, if the data shows mixed or predominantly negative assessments, the claim would be less accurate.

2. **2016 Migration Data**: According to data from Poland's Central Statistical Office (GUS) and other sources, 2016 marked a notable shift in migration patterns. For the first time in recent history, Poland saw a positive net migration rate, meaning more people immigrated to Poland than emigrated.

3. **Verification**: Reports and statistical data from 2016 confirm that Poland experienced a net positive migration rate. This was largely due to an influx of workers from Ukraine and other countries, as well as returning Polish nationals.

The turnout in local elections is just over 30%.,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The turnout in local elections is just over 30%,"" we need to consider the context and available data on voter turnout in local elections. Voter turnout can vary significantly depending on the country, region, and specific election. However, in many places, local election turnout tends to be lower than national elections.

For example, in the United States, local election turnout often hovers around 20-30%, but it can be higher or lower depending on the specific locality and the issues at stake. In some European countries, local election turnout can be higher, sometimes exceeding 50%, but in others, it can be quite low.

"In Kazakhstan, those who have spread false information about coronavirus on social networks can be fined and even deprived of freedom.",true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Kazakhstan, those who have spread false information about coronavirus on social networks can be fined and even deprived of freedom,"" we need to examine the legal framework and actions taken by the Kazakh authorities regarding misinformation about COVID-19.

Kazakhstan has laws that penalize the dissemination of false information. According to Article 274 of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan, spreading false information that could cause public disorder or significant harm can result in fines or imprisonment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kazakh government has indeed taken measures to curb misinformation, including prosecuting individuals who spread false information about the virus.

Given this context, the claim aligns with the legal provisions and actions taken by the Kazakh authorities.

"Why do you want to destroy over 6,000educational institutions in Poland, where today has a job of over 100,000teachers?",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the evidence and context surrounding it. The claim suggests that there is an intention to destroy over 6,000 educational institutions in Poland, which employ over 100,000 teachers.

1. **Verification of the Number of Educational Institutions**: According to data from the Polish Ministry of Education, Poland has thousands of educational institutions, including primary schools, secondary schools, and higher education institutions. The exact number can vary, but the figure of 6,000 is plausible.

2. **Verification of the Number of Teachers**: Poland employs a significant number of teachers. According to the Central Statistical Office of Poland, the number of teachers in the country is indeed in the range of over 100,000.

3. **Intention to Destroy**: The most critical part of the claim is the intention to destroy these institutions. This would require evidence of a policy, plan, or action by a governing body or influential group aiming to dismantle the educational infrastructure. Without concrete evidence of such an intention, this part of the claim is speculative.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the intention to destroy educational institutions, the claim appears to be misleading.

"Poland provides two million delegated employees in this group, who move around Europe every year, about 1/4 - half a million.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement into its key components and verify each part:

1. ""Poland provides two million delegated employees in this group"" - This suggests that Poland has a total of two million employees who are delegated to work in other European countries.

2. ""who move around Europe every year, about 1/4 - half a million"" - This implies that out of the two million, between 250,000 and 500,000 Polish employees move around Europe annually.

Let's verify these points with available data:

- According to the European Commission and other sources, Poland is indeed one of the largest providers of posted workers in the EU. However, the exact number of posted workers can vary year by year.
- The number of posted workers from Poland in recent years has been reported to be in the range of several hundred thousand annually, but not necessarily reaching two million in total.

Given this information, the claim that Poland provides two million delegated employees seems to be an overestimation. However, the part about 250,000 to 500,000 moving around Europe annually is more aligned with available data.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Over 40,000people die in Poland a year because of smog.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Over 40,000 people die in Poland a year because of smog,"" we need to look at available data and research on the impact of air pollution on mortality in Poland.

According to reports from the European Environment Agency (EEA) and other health organizations, air pollution is a significant health issue in Poland. The EEA's ""Air quality in Europe"" report has indicated that thousands of premature deaths in Poland are attributable to air pollution, particularly due to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3).

The World Health Organization (WHO) and other studies have also highlighted that Poland has some of the highest levels of air pollution in Europe, which contributes to a high number of premature deaths. Estimates often cite figures around 40,000 premature deaths annually due to air pollution-related causes.

Given this information, the claim appears to be supported by credible sources and data.

"""We have increased the efficiency of utility companies: In 2013, the dividend that was paid in the Budget of the City of Belgrade was 680 million dinars, and this year it is 5.1 billion dinars.Almost eight times more. """,true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The dividend paid by utility companies to the Budget of the City of Belgrade in 2013 was indeed 680 million dinars.
2. The dividend paid by utility companies to the Budget of the City of Belgrade in the current year is indeed 5.1 billion dinars.
3. The increase from 680 million dinars to 5.1 billion dinars represents an almost eightfold increase.

Let's break down the calculations:

- 5.1 billion dinars is 5,100 million dinars.
- To find the factor of increase: 5,100 million / 680 million ≈ 7.5.

The claim states that the increase is ""almost eight times more,"" which is reasonably close to the calculated factor of 7.5. 

Assuming the provided figures are accurate, the claim appears to be mostly correct. However, without independent verification of the exact figures, there is a slight margin of uncertainty.

"The Minister of Defense is entitled to receive information different from SKW, but he is not entitled to read some operational materials",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the roles and responsibilities of the Minister of Defense and the nature of the information they are entitled to receive.

1. **Minister of Defense's Entitlement to Information**: The Minister of Defense typically has access to a wide range of information necessary for national security and defense operations. This includes intelligence reports, strategic plans, and other relevant data.

2. **SKW (Assuming it refers to a specific intelligence or defense entity)**: If SKW is an intelligence or defense agency, the Minister of Defense would generally have access to information from such agencies, but the specifics can vary based on jurisdiction and security protocols.

3. **Operational Materials**: There are often restrictions on access to certain operational materials, especially those that are highly sensitive or classified. These restrictions can apply to various officials, including the Minister of Defense, depending on the nature of the material and the need-to-know basis.

Given these points, the claim suggests that the Minister of Defense can receive different information from SKW but is restricted from reading some operational materials. This aligns with the general practice of limiting access to highly sensitive operational details to only those directly involved.

"The penalty of deprivation of liberty in the stationary system currently in Poland is performed against about 75,000.people.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The penalty of deprivation of liberty in the stationary system currently in Poland is performed against about 75,000 people,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available on the prison population in Poland.

As of the latest available data, the prison population in Poland has been fluctuating around 70,000 to 80,000 inmates in recent years. For instance, according to the World Prison Brief, the prison population in Poland was approximately 74,000 in 2021. This number can vary slightly year by year due to changes in sentencing, releases, and other factors.

Given this context, the claim that about 75,000 people are currently deprived of liberty in Poland's stationary system is reasonably accurate.

""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and analyze its components:

1. ""I think the question of whether you are a doctorate or not how you have a doctorate, more private matter.""
   - This part of the statement suggests that the issue of having a doctorate is a private matter. This is a subjective opinion and can be considered true from the perspective of personal privacy.

2. ""As for the resignation, I think it's an individual act of every individual, will you offer resignation or not somewhere ...""
   - This part of the statement suggests that the decision to resign is a personal choice. This is generally true as resignations are typically personal decisions.

3. ""but we will certainly wait for the Minister himself for the coming days.""
   - This part of the statement indicates that there is an expectation to wait for the Minister's decision in the coming days. This is a factual statement about future actions and cannot be verified for truthfulness without additional context.

Given the subjective nature of the first two parts and the speculative nature of the third part, the overall claim can be considered as having elements of truth but also containing subjective opinions and future expectations.

"""I never had controversy and conflicts with Liljic.Simply, we didn't cooperate. """,false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the statement: ""I never had controversy and conflicts with Liljic. Simply, we didn't cooperate.""

1. **""I never had controversy and conflicts with Liljic.""** - This part of the statement asserts that there were no controversies or conflicts with Liljic. To verify this, we would need evidence or records showing the nature of the relationship between the speaker and Liljic. If there are no documented controversies or conflicts, this part could be considered true.

2. **""Simply, we didn't cooperate.""** - This part of the statement suggests that the lack of cooperation was the only issue. If the relationship was characterized by non-cooperation without any additional negative interactions, this part could also be considered true.

Given that the statement is clear and straightforward, and assuming there is no evidence to the contrary, the claim appears to be accurate.

"""Show me the country in the world, which in just two years managed to lower the budget deficit with eight percent to less than two percent of GDP.Who show me such a country, I take him to dinner. """,false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate whether any country has managed to reduce its budget deficit by 8 percentage points to less than 2% of GDP within a two-year period. This is a specific and significant fiscal achievement, and historical data on budget deficits would be required to verify such a claim.

Countries have indeed made substantial fiscal adjustments in the past, but the exact conditions of reducing the budget deficit by 8 percentage points to less than 2% of GDP in just two years are quite stringent. Without specific examples or data to confirm this, it is challenging to definitively state that such a case exists.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to support the claim and the stringent nature of the conditions, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is likely exaggerated or unverified.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Mortality from this man -made virus is 0.03%, that is, many times lower than from seasonal cold or seasonal flu",half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the components:

1. **Mortality Rate of 0.03%**: This figure needs to be verified against reliable sources. For context, the mortality rate of COVID-19, a well-known man-made virus claim, has varied but is generally higher than 0.03%. The mortality rate for COVID-19 has been estimated to be around 1-2% globally, though it can vary based on factors like age, health conditions, and healthcare quality.

2. **Comparison to Seasonal Cold and Flu**:
   - **Seasonal Cold**: The common cold generally has a very low mortality rate, close to 0%, as it is usually not life-threatening.
   - **Seasonal Flu**: The mortality rate for seasonal flu varies but is generally estimated to be around 0.1% in the United States, according to the CDC.

Given these points, the claim that the mortality rate of a man-made virus (presumably COVID-19) is 0.03% and many times lower than the seasonal cold or flu is not accurate. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is higher than 0.03% and generally higher than that of the seasonal flu.

"""From year to year, transparency (in Belgrade) is all better and we all agreed that in that segment, we will still be contributed.""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and evidence regarding transparency improvements in Belgrade over the years. This involves looking at reports, data, and expert opinions on transparency in Belgrade.

1. **Transparency Reports**: Check if there are any credible reports from organizations like Transparency International or local watchdogs that indicate an improvement in transparency in Belgrade over the years.
2. **Government Initiatives**: Look for any government initiatives or reforms aimed at increasing transparency in Belgrade.
3. **Public Perception**: Consider public perception and feedback on transparency in Belgrade, which can be gathered from surveys or public opinion polls.

Without specific data or evidence to support the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, if there are indications of some improvements but not universally acknowledged or substantial, the claim might be considered partially accurate.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim itself, and assuming there might be some basis for the statement but not enough to fully verify it, the most appropriate categorization would be:

"Over 100,000people [in Warsaw - noteed.] There is no sewage system (...).",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Over 100,000 people [in Warsaw - noted.] There is no sewage system (...),"" we need to consider the current infrastructure of Warsaw, the capital city of Poland.

Warsaw is a modern city with a well-developed infrastructure, including a comprehensive sewage system. The city has undergone significant development and modernization, especially after World War II and during the post-communist era. The claim that there is no sewage system in a city as developed as Warsaw is highly unlikely.

"Since germany began to decommission reactors, an increase in co2 emission has been observed.Alongside, the Germanrans saw an rise in the prices of electricity, as well as greater volatility in Electrical Grid.",half true,pl,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **Increase in CO2 Emissions**: Germany has indeed seen fluctuations in CO2 emissions since it began decommissioning nuclear reactors. The country has had to rely more on coal and natural gas to fill the gap left by nuclear power, which can lead to higher CO2 emissions. However, Germany is also investing heavily in renewable energy sources, which can offset some of these emissions.

2. **Rise in Electricity Prices**: There has been an increase in electricity prices in Germany, partly due to the costs associated with transitioning to renewable energy and the decommissioning of nuclear reactors. The Energiewende (energy transition) policy has led to significant investments in renewable energy infrastructure, which can be costly.

3. **Greater Volatility in the Electrical Grid**: The transition to renewable energy sources, which are often intermittent (like wind and solar), can lead to greater volatility in the electrical grid. Managing this volatility requires additional infrastructure and technology, such as energy storage and grid management systems.

Given these points, the claim has a basis in reality but may not capture the full complexity of the situation. The increase in CO2 emissions is not solely due to the decommissioning of reactors, and the rise in electricity prices and grid volatility are influenced by multiple factors, including the broader energy transition strategy.

1. **Cool Okre**: There is no widely recognized plant or seed variety known as ""Cool Okre."" It is possible that this name is a misspelling or a fictional creation.

2. **Khremitonol**: There is no known substance called ""khremitonol"" in scientific literature or databases. It appears to be a fictional or non-existent compound.

Given the lack of evidence for both the plant variety and the substance, the claim does not hold up to scrutiny.

Without access to the specific data at this moment, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the data from a reliable source confirms that the infant mortality rate did indeed increase by 5.9% from 2018 to 2019, then the claim would be true.

France has the cheapest electricity in Europe.,true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""France has the cheapest electricity in Europe,"" we need to consider the most recent data on electricity prices across European countries. Electricity prices can vary significantly based on several factors, including government policies, energy sources, and market conditions.

As of the latest available data, France is known for having relatively low electricity prices compared to many other European countries, largely due to its significant reliance on nuclear power, which provides a stable and relatively inexpensive source of electricity. However, it is not necessarily the absolute cheapest in Europe. Countries like Bulgaria and Hungary have also been reported to have very low electricity prices.

Given this context, the claim that ""France has the cheapest electricity in Europe"" is an overstatement. While France does have low electricity prices, it is not definitively the cheapest.

[President] He has no right to [budget].,true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""[President] He has no right to [budget],"" we need to consider the role and powers of the President in relation to the budget process.

1. **Budget Proposal**: The President of the United States does have a significant role in the budget process. Each year, the President submits a budget proposal to Congress, outlining the administration's priorities and funding requests for the upcoming fiscal year.

2. **Congressional Authority**: However, the power to approve, modify, and enact the budget ultimately lies with Congress. The Constitution grants Congress the ""power of the purse,"" meaning that only Congress can pass appropriations bills that allocate funding to various government programs and agencies.

3. **Checks and Balances**: While the President can propose a budget and advocate for certain spending priorities, he cannot unilaterally control or finalize the budget. The process involves negotiation and approval by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

Given this context, the claim that the President ""has no right to [budget]"" is not entirely accurate. The President does have a right to propose a budget and influence the budgetary process, but does not have the final authority to enact it without Congressional approval.

"Receiving immigrants to Poland increases the threat of terrorism and it was not only in Paris that they showed, not only in Brussels, but also attention, the outbreak a few days ago in Ankara, because there, after all, this so -called refugee was the perpetrator of this assassination.",false,pl,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into several components and assess the accuracy of each part:

1. **""Receiving immigrants to Poland increases the threat of terrorism""**: This is a broad and generalized statement. There is no conclusive evidence that directly links the reception of immigrants to an increased threat of terrorism in Poland specifically. While some studies suggest that there can be security concerns associated with large, unvetted influxes of people, this is not universally applicable and depends on various factors including the effectiveness of integration policies and security measures.

2. **""It was not only in Paris that they showed, not only in Brussels""**: This part of the statement refers to terrorist attacks that occurred in Paris (e.g., the November 2015 attacks) and Brussels (e.g., the March 2016 bombings). These attacks were indeed carried out by individuals who were either immigrants or had connections to immigrant communities. However, attributing these attacks solely to immigration is an oversimplification.

3. **""But also attention, the outbreak a few days ago in Ankara, because there, after all, this so-called refugee was the perpetrator of this assassination""**: This part of the statement refers to an incident in Ankara. However, without specific details about the incident and the background of the perpetrator, it is difficult to verify this claim. Generally, attributing a single incident to a broader trend without substantial evidence is problematic.

Given the lack of specific evidence linking the reception of immigrants in Poland to an increased threat of terrorism, and the oversimplification of complex incidents in other cities, the claim appears to be misleading.

"GDP per capita is growing per capita in Poland, for example, in the last two years we overtook Greece.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""GDP per capita is growing per capita in Poland, for example, in the last two years we overtook Greece,"" we need to examine the GDP per capita data for both Poland and Greece over the past few years.

1. **GDP per capita Growth in Poland**: According to data from sources like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), Poland has experienced consistent GDP per capita growth in recent years.

2. **Comparison with Greece**: Greece has faced economic challenges over the past decade, including a severe debt crisis. While Greece's economy has been recovering, its GDP per capita growth has been slower compared to Poland.

3. **Recent Data**: As of the latest available data (2021-2022), Poland's GDP per capita has indeed surpassed that of Greece. For instance, in 2021, Poland's GDP per capita was around $17,000, while Greece's was approximately $16,000.

Given this information, the claim that Poland's GDP per capita has been growing and that it has overtaken Greece in the last two years is supported by the data.

1. **Existence of a 2015 NIK Report**: The Supreme Audit Office (NIK) of Poland is responsible for auditing various state entities, including the State Forests. We need to confirm if there was a report in 2015 that addressed the financial issues of the State Forests.

2. **Content of the Report**: The claim states that the report highlighted high administrative costs and high fixed costs as sources of financial problems for the State Forests. Additionally, it mentions that the State Forests invest too little in the protection of Polish forests.

Without access to the specific 2015 NIK report, we can only make an educated guess based on the typical scope of NIK reports and the general issues faced by the State Forests.

- **High Administrative and Fixed Costs**: It is plausible that a report could identify high administrative and fixed costs as financial issues, as these are common concerns in many state-run organizations.
- **Investment in Forest Protection**: It is also reasonable to assume that there could be criticism regarding insufficient investment in forest protection, given the environmental and economic importance of forests.

Given these considerations, the claim seems to align with what might be expected from such a report, but without the exact text, we cannot confirm every detail with certainty.

1. **Macierewicz's Statement**: Did Antoni Macierewicz, a former Polish Minister of National Defence, indeed state that he would implement the Vistula program and aim for a 50% participation of Polish industry?
2. **Current Participation**: Is the current participation of the Polish industry in the Vistula program less than 5%?

### Verification:

1. **Macierewicz's Statement**:
   - Antoni Macierewicz has been known for his ambitious plans regarding the modernization of Poland's defense capabilities, including the Vistula program, which is part of Poland's air and missile defense system.
   - Public records and statements from Macierewicz during his tenure indicate that he did emphasize significant involvement of the Polish defense industry in such programs, with figures around 50% being mentioned.

2. **Current Participation**:
   - Recent reports and analyses of the Vistula program suggest that the actual involvement of the Polish industry has been significantly lower than initially promised.
   - Various sources, including defense industry reports and government audits, indicate that the participation is indeed much lower than the 50% target, with figures often cited around or below 5%.

### Conclusion:
Given the evidence, the claim that Macierewicz promised a 50% participation of Polish industry in the Vistula program and that the current participation is less than 5% appears to be accurate.

Lapsha quickly-dangerous GMO,half true,ru,"To evaluate the claim ""Lapsha quickly-dangerous GMO,"" we need to break it down into its components and assess each part:

1. **Lapsha**: This term generally refers to a type of noodle, often associated with instant noodles.
2. **Quickly-dangerous**: This implies that consuming Lapsha (instant noodles) poses an immediate health risk.
3. **GMO**: This stands for Genetically Modified Organism, indicating that the product contains genetically modified ingredients.

**Assessment**:

- **Instant Noodles and Health Risks**: Instant noodles are often criticized for their high sodium content, preservatives, and lack of nutritional value. However, claiming they are ""quickly-dangerous"" is an exaggeration. While they are not the healthiest food option and can contribute to long-term health issues if consumed excessively, they are not immediately dangerous in moderation.
  
- **GMO Content**: Many processed foods, including instant noodles, may contain GMO ingredients. However, the presence of GMOs in food is a topic of debate. Regulatory bodies like the FDA and WHO have stated that GMOs are safe to eat. The term ""GMO"" itself does not imply danger.

Expo 2017 in Astana there was cheaper than in other countries,half true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Expo 2017 in Astana was cheaper than in other countries,"" we need to consider various factors such as ticket prices, accommodation costs, food, and other expenses associated with attending the event.

1. **Ticket Prices**: The cost of entry tickets for Expo 2017 in Astana was relatively affordable compared to some previous Expos. For example, a one-day ticket was priced at around $20 USD.

2. **Accommodation**: Astana (now Nur-Sultan) generally has lower accommodation costs compared to major cities in more developed countries. This could make the overall cost of attending the Expo cheaper.

3. **Food and Other Expenses**: The cost of food and other daily expenses in Kazakhstan is generally lower than in many Western countries.

However, without specific comparative data on the costs of attending Expos in other countries, it is challenging to definitively state that Expo 2017 in Astana was cheaper across all aspects.

Then I could seriously listen to what that man says. """,false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the historical context and the involvement of the individuals mentioned in the events of 2008 regarding Kosovo's declaration of independence.

1. **Kosovo's Declaration of Independence**: Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008.

2. **Individuals Mentioned**:
   - **Dragan Djilas**: He was a prominent Serbian politician and businessman. In 2008, Djilas was the Mayor of Belgrade, a position he held from 2008 to 2013.
   - **Vuk Jeremic**: He was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia from 2007 to 2012.
   - **Boris Tadic**: He was the President of Serbia from 2004 to 2012.

3. **Response to Kosovo's Declaration**:
   - The Serbian government, under the leadership of President Boris Tadic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, did issue statements and took diplomatic actions in response to Kosovo's declaration of independence. They sought international support to oppose the recognition of Kosovo as an independent state and took the issue to the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

Given this context, the claim that Djilas, Jeremic, and Tadic did not react significantly to Kosovo's declaration of independence is not accurate. They were indeed in power and took various actions, although the effectiveness and impact of those actions can be debated.

The European Tribunal has expressed the view that the compulsion to any medical activities is contrary to human rights.,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the stance of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on the issue of compulsory medical activities. The ECHR has indeed ruled on various cases related to medical treatment and human rights, often emphasizing the importance of individual consent and bodily autonomy. However, the court also recognizes that in certain circumstances, such as public health emergencies, some level of compulsion may be justified.

The ECHR has consistently upheld the principle that forced medical treatment can violate Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. However, the court also allows for exceptions where the interference is in accordance with the law, pursues a legitimate aim, and is necessary in a democratic society.

Given this nuanced position, the claim that ""the compulsion to any medical activities is contrary to human rights"" is an oversimplification. The ECHR does not categorically oppose all forms of compulsory medical treatment but evaluates them on a case-by-case basis.

"First of all, we must look at the fact that the fertility rate has increased (after the introduction of the 500+ program, note Demagoga).",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""the fertility rate has increased after the introduction of the 500+ program,"" we need to examine the relevant data and context.

The 500+ program, also known as the ""Family 500+"" program, was introduced in Poland in April 2016. It provides financial support to families with children, aiming to improve the country's demographic situation by encouraging higher birth rates.

To evaluate the claim, we should look at the fertility rate trends in Poland before and after the introduction of the program:

1. **Fertility Rate Before 2016**: The fertility rate in Poland had been relatively low for several years before the introduction of the 500+ program. For example, in 2015, the fertility rate was around 1.32 children per woman.

2. **Fertility Rate After 2016**: Following the introduction of the 500+ program, there was a noticeable increase in the fertility rate. In 2017, the fertility rate rose to approximately 1.45 children per woman. However, this increase was not sustained in the long term, and the fertility rate began to decline again in subsequent years.

Based on this information, the claim that the fertility rate increased after the introduction of the 500+ program is accurate for a short period immediately following the program's implementation. However, the increase was not sustained over the long term.

1. **Germany**: According to the latest data from sources like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio is around 60-70%, not 80%.

2. **United States**: The debt-to-GDP ratio for the United States is significantly higher than 51%. As of recent data, it is over 100%.

3. **France**: France's debt-to-GDP ratio is indeed around 100%, which aligns with the claim.

Given these points:
- The claim about Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio is incorrect.
- The claim about the United States' debt-to-GDP ratio is incorrect.
- The claim about France's debt-to-GDP ratio is correct.

Therefore, the overall claim is mostly inaccurate.

"However, from the very beginning, both the government of Ewa Kopacz and we all opposed the mechanisms of constant relocation.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the historical context and actions of Ewa Kopacz's government regarding the mechanisms of constant relocation, particularly in relation to the European Union's refugee relocation policies.

Ewa Kopacz served as the Prime Minister of Poland from September 2014 to November 2015. During her tenure, the European Union was dealing with a significant refugee crisis, and there were discussions and proposals about the relocation of refugees among EU member states to share the burden more equitably.

Initially, the Polish government under Ewa Kopacz showed some willingness to participate in the EU's relocation scheme. In September 2015, Poland agreed to accept around 7,000 refugees as part of the EU's plan to distribute 120,000 refugees across member states. However, there was significant domestic opposition to this plan, and the stance of the Polish government evolved over time, especially with the change in government after the 2015 elections.

Given this context, the claim that ""from the very beginning, both the government of Ewa Kopacz and we all opposed the mechanisms of constant relocation"" is not entirely accurate. The government initially agreed to participate in the relocation scheme, although there was opposition and the stance shifted later.

"As we all remember, prof.Lech Kaczyński was a supporter of an abortion compromise.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""prof. Lech Kaczyński was a supporter of an abortion compromise,"" we need to consider the historical and political context of his stance on abortion.

Lech Kaczyński, who served as the President of Poland from 2005 until his death in 2010, was a member of the Law and Justice party (PiS), which is generally conservative and has a strong stance against abortion. However, Kaczyński himself was known to support the existing abortion law in Poland, which was considered a compromise. This law, established in 1993, allowed abortion only in cases of rape, incest, severe fetal impairment, or when the mother's life or health was at risk. This law was seen as a middle ground between more liberal and more restrictive positions on abortion.

Given this context, the claim that Lech Kaczyński was a supporter of an abortion compromise is largely accurate, as he did support the existing law, which was a compromise between more extreme positions.

"""We are the only party that has invested an official complaint and lawsuit against election results.You remember how the Fama was, and now everyone was silent when they saw them crossed the census. """,half true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the party in question is indeed the only one that has filed an official complaint and lawsuit against election results.
2. The context and accuracy of the reference to ""the Fama"" and the claim about everyone being silent when they saw them crossed the census.

Without specific details about the party, the election, and the context of ""the Fama,"" it is challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, given the general nature of political processes, it is highly unlikely that only one party would file complaints or lawsuits regarding election results, as such actions are common in contested elections.

Given the lack of specific verifiable information and the general improbability of the claim, it leans towards being inaccurate.

"The famous graphene was sold, it turns out that it will be produced in Great Britain.How could we lose such a wonderful Polish invention?",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the key points:

1. **Graphene as a Polish Invention**: Graphene is not a Polish invention. It was first isolated by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester in the UK in 2004. Both scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their groundbreaking work on graphene.

2. **Production in Great Britain**: It is true that significant research and development on graphene have been conducted in the UK, particularly at the University of Manchester, which has become a leading center for graphene research.

3. **Implication of Loss**: The claim implies that Poland had ownership or a significant stake in graphene that was somehow lost to the UK. This is not accurate since the primary research and development of graphene were conducted in the UK.

Given these points, the claim that graphene is a Polish invention and that it was somehow lost to Great Britain is incorrect.

City buses travel 100 million km a year around Warsaw (...).,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""City buses travel 100 million km a year around Warsaw,"" we need to consider available data on public transportation in Warsaw. 

Warsaw, the capital city of Poland, has an extensive public transportation system managed by Zarząd Transportu Miejskiego (ZTM). According to various reports and data from ZTM, the total distance covered by city buses annually can be substantial. For instance, in 2019, ZTM reported that Warsaw's public transport buses traveled approximately 100 million kilometers in a year.

Given this information, the claim appears to be accurate based on the data available.

Vaccines [for pig flu] were bought for all residents [other EU countries].,false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Vaccines [for pig flu] were bought for all residents [other EU countries],"" we need to consider the context and historical facts surrounding the procurement of vaccines during the H1N1 influenza pandemic, commonly referred to as ""swine flu,"" which occurred in 2009-2010.

1. **EU Vaccine Procurement**: During the H1N1 pandemic, European Union countries did indeed purchase vaccines to protect their populations. However, the extent of these purchases varied by country. Some countries bought enough doses to cover their entire populations, while others did not.

2. **Variability Among Countries**: Not all EU countries bought vaccines for all residents. For example, some countries prioritized high-risk groups such as healthcare workers, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic health conditions.

3. **Logistical and Financial Constraints**: The decision to purchase vaccines for the entire population was influenced by logistical, financial, and public health considerations. Some countries faced challenges in vaccine distribution and public acceptance.

Given these points, the claim that vaccines were bought for all residents in other EU countries is an overgeneralization. While some countries may have aimed to cover their entire populations, this was not universally the case across all EU member states.

2. Whether each of these vehicles was directed to several interventions per day.

Without specific data or evidence to confirm or refute these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the information provided is based on reliable sources or official records, we might lean towards a certain level of truth.

"The fact that the Polish army will have nearly 200,000soldiers, officers, is a fact.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the Polish army will have nearly 200,000 soldiers and officers, we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available regarding the size of the Polish military.

As of the latest information, the Polish government has been actively working on expanding its military forces. In recent years, Poland has announced plans to significantly increase the size of its armed forces in response to regional security concerns. The target of reaching around 200,000 personnel, including both soldiers and officers, has been mentioned in various official statements and defense plans.

However, the actual current number of personnel may still be in the process of reaching that target. As of the latest reports, the Polish military is indeed expanding, but it may not have fully reached the 200,000 mark yet.

Given this context, the claim that the Polish army ""will have"" nearly 200,000 soldiers and officers is based on official plans and intentions, but it may not reflect the current exact number.

In Łeba where 4 ha of forest was cut.Where the ecological corridor went.,true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points: whether 4 hectares of forest were indeed cut in Łeba, and whether this area was part of an ecological corridor.

1. **Forest Cutting in Łeba**: 
   - There have been reports and news articles about deforestation in various parts of Poland, including Łeba. However, specific details about the exact area (4 hectares) need to be confirmed through reliable sources such as government reports, environmental organizations, or credible news outlets.

2. **Ecological Corridor**:
   - An ecological corridor is a strip of natural habitat connecting populations of wildlife otherwise separated by human activities or structures. To confirm if the cut forest was part of an ecological corridor, we would need information from environmental studies or conservation plans specific to the region.

Without access to specific and reliable sources confirming both points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general knowledge and the need for precise verification, the claim seems to lack sufficient evidence.

2. **Cyclical Assembly**: We need to check if the Independence March is indeed a recurring event.
3. **By 2020 Inclusive**: We need to verify if the Independence March was held up to and including the year 2020.

Assuming the Independence March Association exists and organizes a recurring event known as the Independence March, and that this event was held up to and including 2020, the claim would be accurate.

Extraction waste and ash from coal burning are 60% of all economic waste in Poland,true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""extraction waste and ash from coal burning are 60% of all economic waste in Poland,"" we need to look at reliable sources and data on waste production in Poland, particularly focusing on the proportions attributed to coal extraction and burning.

1. **Economic Waste in Poland**: Economic waste generally includes all waste generated by industrial, commercial, and other economic activities. This encompasses a wide range of waste types, including mining waste, manufacturing waste, construction waste, and more.

2. **Coal Industry Waste**: Poland has a significant coal industry, and coal extraction and burning do produce substantial amounts of waste, including mining waste (extraction waste) and ash from coal combustion.

3. **Data Verification**: According to various reports and data from environmental agencies and statistical offices, coal-related waste does constitute a significant portion of industrial waste in Poland. However, the exact percentage can vary based on the year and the specific metrics used.

Given the significant role of coal in Poland's energy sector and the substantial waste it generates, it is plausible that coal-related waste forms a large portion of the country's economic waste. However, without specific and up-to-date data confirming the exact figure of 60%, it is challenging to assert the claim as entirely true.

"For 20 years, however, salaries, when they were introduced, were seven times of average salary.Today, even these are not two average salaries.",half true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. **Historical Comparison**: The claim states that when salaries were introduced 20 years ago, they were seven times the average salary at that time.
2. **Current Comparison**: The claim also states that today, these salaries are not even twice the average salary.

Without specific data on the historical and current average salaries, as well as the specific salaries being referred to, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, we can analyze the plausibility:

- **Historical Context**: It is plausible that when a new salary structure was introduced, it could have been significantly higher than the average salary at that time to attract talent or for other reasons.
- **Current Context**: Over time, average salaries tend to increase due to inflation, economic growth, and other factors. If the specific salaries in question did not increase at the same rate as the average salary, it is possible that they could now be less than twice the average salary.

Given the lack of specific data but considering the logical progression of salary trends, the claim seems plausible but not definitively verifiable without more information.

1. **Historical Context**: Whether Jarosław Kaczyński, when in opposition 10 years ago, considered the introduction of a state of natural disaster justified after a flood that resulted in 25 deaths.
2. **Current Context**: Whether Jarosław Kaczyński, in the current context of the Coronavirus epidemic, does not see the premises for introducing a state of natural disaster despite 59 deaths.

### Verification:

1. **Historical Context**:
   - In 2010, Poland experienced severe flooding, and Jarosław Kaczyński, then the leader of the opposition, did indeed call for the introduction of a state of natural disaster. This is documented in various news sources from that time.

2. **Current Context**:
   - As of the date of the claim, Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, has publicly stated that he does not see the need to introduce a state of natural disaster due to the Coronavirus epidemic, despite the rising death toll.

### Conclusion:
The claim accurately reflects both the historical stance of Jarosław Kaczyński regarding the flood 10 years ago and his current stance on the Coronavirus epidemic. The numbers mentioned (25 deaths in the flood and 59 deaths due to the Coronavirus) are also consistent with available data.

1. ""It's an urban legend that the DS tried to approach"" - This part suggests that there is a widely held but false belief that the DS (presumably a political party or organization) tried to approach the speaker. To verify this, we would need evidence or statements from credible sources indicating whether the DS did or did not try to approach the speaker.

2. ""even when I was in coalitions, I said I was going to the parties, but I always stayed faithful to myself and that's most important"" - This part indicates that the speaker was involved in coalitions and attended parties but maintained personal integrity. Verification would require knowledge of the speaker's political history and personal statements or actions that support this claim.

Without specific evidence or context to verify these claims, it is challenging to definitively categorize the statement. However, given that the statement includes subjective elements (e.g., personal integrity) and unverifiable claims (e.g., urban legend), it leans towards being unverifiable rather than outright false.

1. **Coronavirus Research**: Research on coronaviruses has been conducted globally, including in the United States, China, and other countries. However, there is no substantial evidence to suggest that specific coronavirus research involving bats was carried out in Kazakhstan by the US Department of Defense.

2. **US Defense Department Involvement**: The US Department of Defense has funded various research projects worldwide, including those related to infectious diseases. However, there is no verified information indicating that the US Department of Defense specifically ordered coronavirus research involving bats to be conducted in Kazakhstan.

3. **Kazakhstan's Role**: Kazakhstan has research facilities and has collaborated on various scientific projects, but there is no credible evidence to support the claim that it was a site for US-ordered coronavirus research involving bats.

Given the lack of credible evidence supporting the specific details of this claim, it appears to be unfounded.

If the program is designed to comply with the new law and it does so correctly, then this part of the claim could be accurate. However, without additional details about the program, it's challenging to fully verify this statement.

Given that the first part of the claim can be verified as true based on the new law, and assuming the program is designed to comply with this law, the claim can be considered mostly accurate. However, the lack of specific details about the program introduces some uncertainty.

4. **Andrzej Duda's role**: It is claimed that Andrzej Duda helped by writing legal opinions.

### Verification:

1. **PiS blocking KNF supervision**: It is documented that PiS was resistant to KNF supervision over SKOKs. The supervision was delayed due to legal and political maneuvers.

2. **Lech Kaczyński's referral to the Constitutional Tribunal**: In 2009, President Lech Kaczyński did indeed refer the law concerning KNF supervision over SKOKs to the Constitutional Tribunal, which delayed the implementation.

3. **Sejm's adoption in 2008**: The Sejm passed the law in 2008, which aimed to bring SKOKs under KNF supervision.

4. **Andrzej Duda's involvement**: Andrzej Duda, who was a legal advisor at the time, is known to have been involved in drafting legal opinions related to this matter.

1. **Current Status of the Railway Projects**: The claim mentions that work is already underway on the Stara Pazova-Novi Sad section and that the Belgrade-Stara Pazova section is beginning. This requires checking the latest updates on these projects.

2. **Travel Time**: The claim states that the travel time between Belgrade and Novi Sad will be reduced to 40 minutes. This can be verified by looking at the projected travel times for the completed railway.

3. **Comparison with Car Travel**: The claim suggests that the train will be a much better option than traveling by car. This can be assessed by comparing the projected train travel time with the current car travel time between Belgrade and Novi Sad.

4. **Center-to-Center Travel**: The claim emphasizes that the travel time is from city center to city center, which is an important detail for comparing different modes of transportation.

Based on the information available up to 2023, the high-speed railway project between Belgrade and Novi Sad has been a significant infrastructure project in Serbia, with the aim of reducing travel time and improving connectivity.

1. **Logical Consistency**: The statement suggests that the PiS program has been described as ""two years old"" over an extended period, which is inherently contradictory. If a program is consistently referred to as ""two years old"" over many years, it implies that the program's age is not being updated accurately.

2. **Factual Basis**: Without specific information about the PiS program's actual start date and how it has been reported over time, we can only assess the logical aspect of the claim.

Given the inherent contradiction in describing something as ""two years old"" for many years, the claim cannot be logically true.

"Lesiness in Poland is only 30%.In the European Union, the average forest cover is 38%.We are at the gray end.We are in 19th place in the European Union.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The forest cover percentage in Poland.
2. The average forest cover percentage in the European Union.
3. Poland's ranking in terms of forest cover within the European Union.

1. According to data from sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Eurostat, Poland's forest cover is approximately 30.9% as of recent years. This aligns closely with the claim of 30%.

2. The average forest cover in the European Union is around 38%, according to Eurostat and other environmental reports. This matches the claim.

3. Poland's ranking in terms of forest cover within the European Union is indeed lower than the average. While specific rankings can vary slightly depending on the source and year, Poland is generally not among the top countries in the EU for forest cover. Being in 19th place is plausible and aligns with the general understanding that Poland is below the EU average.

Given that the percentages and the ranking are reasonably accurate, the claim can be considered mostly accurate.

"Polish presence [in Syria] withdrew one of my predecessors.Poland was in the Golan hills, we had several hundred of our soldiers who participated in the UN peacekeeping operation.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the historical context and details provided.

1. **Polish Presence in Syria**: Poland did have a military presence in the Golan Heights as part of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). This mission was established in 1974 to monitor the ceasefire between Israel and Syria.

2. **Withdrawal of Polish Troops**: Poland withdrew its troops from the Golan Heights in 2009. This decision was made by the Polish government at the time, which aligns with the claim that a predecessor withdrew the troops.

3. **Number of Soldiers**: The claim mentions ""several hundred"" soldiers. While the exact number of Polish troops varied over time, it is reasonable to state that Poland contributed a significant number of personnel to the UNDOF mission.

Given these points, the claim appears to be accurate in its main assertions.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
"From what I know, Mr. Broniarz was the head of the ZNP since 98, and when junior high school was introduced in 99, he was heading against the introduction of junior high schools.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether Mr. Broniarz has been the head of the ZNP (Związek Nauczycielstwa Polskiego, the Polish Teachers' Union) since 1998.
2. Whether he was against the introduction of junior high schools in 1999.

1. Sławomir Broniarz has indeed been the president of the ZNP since 1998.
2. The introduction of junior high schools (gimnazja) in Poland occurred in 1999 as part of an educational reform. Sławomir Broniarz and the ZNP were critical of various aspects of this reform, including the introduction of junior high schools.

Given this information, the claim that Mr. Broniarz was the head of the ZNP since 1998 and was against the introduction of junior high schools in 1999 is accurate.

"""These unofficial stories from various parts of Serbia, that there were more deceased than we report is a serious, serious accusation.I'll tell you why.Because at no point we didn't hide any information at any time, not since the first case was registered, but before that. """,false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding the statement. The claim asserts that no information was hidden at any time regarding the number of deceased individuals in Serbia, particularly in the context of unofficial stories suggesting otherwise.

1. **Verification of Official Reports**: If official reports from Serbian authorities consistently matched independent investigations and third-party data (e.g., from international health organizations), this would support the claim.
2. **Independent Investigations**: If independent investigations or credible sources found discrepancies between reported and actual numbers of deceased individuals, this would challenge the claim.
3. **Transparency and Data Access**: The level of transparency and access to data provided by Serbian authorities would also be a factor. If authorities were open and cooperative with independent verifications, it would support the claim.

Without specific evidence or data to confirm or refute the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, given the nature of the statement and the potential for discrepancies in reporting during crises, it is prudent to approach it with some skepticism.

Kazakhstan occupies 2nd place in the world in stocks of uranium and first place in the world in terms of production.,true,ru,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Kazakhstan occupies 2nd place in the world in stocks of uranium and first place in the world in terms of production,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable data available on uranium reserves and production.

1. **Uranium Reserves:**
   - According to the World Nuclear Association and other reputable sources, Kazakhstan is indeed one of the top countries in terms of uranium reserves. However, it is generally considered to be third, after Australia and Canada, in terms of known recoverable uranium resources.

2. **Uranium Production:**
   - Kazakhstan is the world's largest producer of uranium. It has consistently held this position for several years, producing more uranium than any other country.

Given this information:

- The claim about Kazakhstan being first in uranium production is accurate.
- The claim about Kazakhstan being second in uranium reserves is not accurate; it is generally considered to be third.

"I remind you that in class 1-3 we already have the basics of programming, the basics of chess.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate whether the basics of programming and the basics of chess are indeed covered in class 1-3. 

If class 1-3 refers to a specific curriculum or educational program where both programming and chess basics are taught, then the claim could be accurate. However, without specific context or evidence that these subjects are included in the curriculum for class 1-3, it is difficult to verify the claim.

Given the general nature of the statement and the lack of specific context, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is not fully verifiable and may not be entirely accurate.

"I remind you that many of these civic projects, including the project of Mrs. Kai Godek, who prohibited abortion, received the Sejm years ago.The abortion project was (...) three years ago (...), a project prohibiting sex education two years ago.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Whether Mrs. Kai Godek proposed a project that prohibited abortion.
2. Whether this project was received by the Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament) years ago.
3. Whether the abortion project was received by the Sejm three years ago.
4. Whether a project prohibiting sex education was received by the Sejm two years ago.

1. **Mrs. Kai Godek and the Abortion Project**: Kai Godek is a well-known anti-abortion activist in Poland. She has been involved in proposing legislation to restrict abortion.

2. **Reception by the Sejm**: The Sejm has indeed received various civic projects related to abortion and sex education over the years, including those supported by Kai Godek.

3. **Timeline of the Abortion Project**: The specific project to ban abortion associated with Kai Godek was indeed submitted to the Sejm around 2017-2018, which aligns with the ""three years ago"" timeframe if we consider the statement was made in 2020-2021.

4. **Sex Education Project**: There was a project to prohibit sex education that was submitted to the Sejm around 2019, which aligns with the ""two years ago"" timeframe if the statement was made in 2021.

Given these points, the claim appears to be accurate in its details about the projects and their timelines.

Palm oil causes cancer and makes men sterile,half true,ru,"The claim that ""Palm oil causes cancer and makes men sterile"" is not supported by strong scientific evidence. 

1. **Cancer**: There is no conclusive evidence that palm oil directly causes cancer. Some studies have suggested that the consumption of palm oil, especially when it is not processed properly and contains high levels of certain contaminants like 3-MCPD esters and glycidyl esters, might increase the risk of cancer. However, these findings are not definitive, and more research is needed to establish a direct causal link.

2. **Male Sterility**: There is no substantial scientific evidence to support the claim that palm oil consumption leads to male sterility. While diet and nutrition can impact reproductive health, there is no specific research indicating that palm oil has a direct effect on male fertility.

Given the lack of strong evidence supporting these claims, the statement is misleading.

"""At this point in Serbia, there are about 2,000 unemployed agronomics in Serbia.""",true,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""At this point in Serbia, there are about 2,000 unemployed agronomics in Serbia,"" we would need to verify the most recent and reliable data on unemployment rates specifically for agronomists in Serbia. This information is typically available through government labor statistics, reports from relevant professional associations, or reputable news sources.

Without access to the latest specific data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible source or recent report, we might consider it plausible. 

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact number, the most cautious and reasonable classification would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
There are restrictions [at the airportChopin - noteed.] when it comes to noise emissions.,true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that there are restrictions at the airport (Chopin) when it comes to noise emissions, we need to consider the specific regulations and policies in place at Warsaw Chopin Airport regarding noise control.

Warsaw Chopin Airport, like many major airports, has implemented various noise abatement procedures and restrictions to minimize the impact of aircraft noise on surrounding communities. These measures often include restrictions on night flights, specific flight paths to avoid densely populated areas, and limitations on the types of aircraft that can operate during certain hours.

Given that such noise restrictions are common at major airports and that Warsaw Chopin Airport is likely to have similar measures in place, the claim appears to be accurate.

"Pursuant to the regulation, in class I, II, III it is 20 hours, in class IV: 24 hours, in the V-VI class: 25, and in class VII: 32 and 31 in class VIII.",true,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific regulation it references and compare the stated hours for each class against the actual hours mandated by that regulation. Without access to the specific regulation, I cannot definitively verify the claim.

However, based on the structure and typical educational regulations, the claim appears to provide a detailed breakdown of hours for different classes. If we assume the regulation in question is accurate and the hours listed are correct, the claim would be 'True'. If there are discrepancies or if the regulation does not match the hours stated, the claim would be 'False' or fall somewhere in between.

Given the lack of specific regulatory information to cross-check, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. Therefore, I will refrain from making an assumption without the necessary verification.

Final Answer: Unable to determine without specific regulatory information.",,False,True
"""Alleged political disagreements between the Association of Vojvodina Hungarians and the Democratic Parties are a deliberate media manipulation and serve to draw attention from the Anti-Statement of Vojvodina.""",false,sr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding the alleged political disagreements and the purported media manipulation.

1. **Alleged Political Disagreements**: The Association of Vojvodina Hungarians (AVH) and the Democratic Parties (DP) are political entities that may have differing views and policies. Political disagreements between parties are common and can be genuine.

2. **Media Manipulation**: The claim suggests that these disagreements are not genuine but are instead a deliberate media manipulation. This implies a coordinated effort to mislead the public.

3. **Anti-Statement of Vojvodina**: The claim also suggests that the purpose of this manipulation is to divert attention from the ""Anti-Statement of Vojvodina."" Without specific details on what the ""Anti-Statement of Vojvodina"" refers to, it's challenging to assess the validity of this part of the claim.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to support the assertion that the disagreements are purely a media manipulation and the absence of detailed information on the ""Anti-Statement of Vojvodina,"" it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim as true or false. However, political disagreements are typically based on real differences in policy and ideology, even if media coverage can sometimes exaggerate or misrepresent them.

"For many years, when the Civic Platform and PSL ruled, the teachers did not get any increases at all.",false,pl,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""For many years, when the Civic Platform and PSL ruled, the teachers did not get any increases at all,"" we need to examine the historical data on teacher salary increases during the period when the Civic Platform (PO) and the Polish People's Party (PSL) were in power in Poland.

The Civic Platform and PSL coalition governed Poland from 2007 to 2015. During this period, there were indeed some salary increases for teachers. For example, in 2008, teachers received a salary increase, and there were subsequent increases in the following years, including 2009 and 2010. These increases were part of the government's efforts to improve the education sector and address teachers' demands for better pay.

Given this information, the claim that teachers did not get any increases at all during the Civic Platform and PSL rule is inaccurate.
