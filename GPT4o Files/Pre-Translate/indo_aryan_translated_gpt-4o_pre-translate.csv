"Photo by George Floyd, who recently died in police torture in Miniapolis, USA",mostly false,bn,"The claim ""Photo by George Floyd, who recently died in police torture in Minneapolis, USA"" is misleading for several reasons:

1. George Floyd was a victim of police brutality and died during an arrest in Minneapolis, USA, on May 25, 2020. His death was widely reported and led to global protests against police violence and systemic racism.
2. The phrase ""police torture"" is not the commonly used term to describe the incident. The widely accepted term is ""police brutality"" or ""police violence.""
3. George Floyd was not known as a photographer, and there is no widely recognized photo attributed to him.

Given these points, the claim is inaccurate.

A picture of social media and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Reliance chief is being viral in Mukesh Ambani hugs.,half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify if there is any credible evidence or reliable sources that confirm the existence of a picture showing Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani hugging.

1. **Search for the Image**: Conduct a reverse image search or look through credible news sources to find the image in question.
2. **Check News Reports**: Look for any news articles or reports that mention such an event or image.
3. **Official Statements**: Check if there are any official statements from either Arvind Kejriwal or Mukesh Ambani regarding this image.

After conducting these checks, if no credible evidence or reliable sources confirm the existence of such an image, the claim can be considered false.

The Israeli Prime Minister's son's photo is serving in the army.,half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Israeli Prime Minister's son's photo is serving in the army,"" we need to break down the statement and verify its components.

1. **Israeli Prime Minister's Son**: The current Israeli Prime Minister (as of my last update in 2023) is Benjamin Netanyahu. He has a son named Yair Netanyahu.
2. **Serving in the Army**: Military service is mandatory in Israel, and it is known that Yair Netanyahu has served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
3. **Photo Serving in the Army**: This part of the claim is ambiguous. If it means that there is a photo of Yair Netanyahu while he was serving in the army, then it is likely true, as photos of soldiers, including public figures' children, are often available.

Given these points, the claim seems to be about the existence of a photo of the Prime Minister's son during his military service. Since Yair Netanyahu has served in the IDF and it is plausible that there are photos of him from that time, the claim can be considered accurate.

"The Ghats of the Ganges river in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are filled with dirt.",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Ghats of the Ganges river in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are filled with dirt,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Status of Cleanliness Efforts**: The Ghats in Varanasi have been the focus of various cleanliness drives, especially under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There have been significant efforts to clean and maintain the Ghats.

2. **Reports and Observations**: While there have been improvements, reports and observations from various sources indicate that maintaining cleanliness is an ongoing challenge. Factors such as the influx of pilgrims, local activities, and natural factors contribute to periodic dirt and pollution.

3. **Public Perception and Media Reports**: Media reports and public perception often highlight both the improvements and the persistent issues related to cleanliness at the Ghats.

Given these points, the claim that the Ghats are ""filled with dirt"" may be an exaggeration, but it is not entirely baseless. The Ghats do face cleanliness challenges, although significant efforts have been made to address them.

Indian Army is harassing Kashmiri women,mostly false,hi,"The claim that the Indian Army is harassing Kashmiri women is a highly sensitive and complex issue. It involves various perspectives, including political, social, and human rights dimensions. Allegations of harassment and human rights abuses have been made by various groups and individuals, and there have been reports and investigations by human rights organizations. However, the Indian government and the Indian Army often deny these allegations, stating that they are committed to upholding human rights and that any violations are exceptions rather than the rule.

Given the complexity and the presence of conflicting reports, it is difficult to categorically state the claim as entirely true or false without a thorough and unbiased investigation.

1. **Check News Reports**: Look for any news articles or reports from reputable news organizations that confirm or deny the seizure of fake notes from a temple in Gujarat during the lockdown.
2. **Official Statements**: Verify if there are any statements from law enforcement agencies or government officials regarding the incident.
3. **Fact-Checking Websites**: Consult fact-checking websites to see if they have investigated this claim.

Without access to real-time data and sources, I cannot verify the claim directly. However, I can guide you on how to proceed with the verification process.

If you find credible sources confirming the incident, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the sources provide partial confirmation or context that changes the interpretation, it might be 'Half True'. If the claim is found to be exaggerated or lacking substantial evidence, it could be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Final Answer: The accuracy of the claim cannot be determined without further verification from reliable sources. Please check credible news reports, official statements, and fact-checking websites to confirm the claim.",,False,True
Best BJP leader Muralinohar Joshi is eating sweet to Modi because of the start of the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya,half true,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several aspects:

1. **Identity of the Leaders**: Murli Manohar Joshi and Narendra Modi are both prominent leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
2. **Event**: The construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya is a significant event for the BJP and its supporters.
3. **Action**: The claim states that Murli Manohar Joshi is eating sweets to celebrate this event with Narendra Modi.

Given the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there is no specific, verified report or widely recognized event that confirms Murli Manohar Joshi eating sweets with Narendra Modi specifically to celebrate the start of the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

"Tabligh Jamaat -e -Islami posts on Facebook about Muslims, Indian industrialist BR Sethi is blacklisted by the Dubai government.",mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. **Tabligh Jamaat-e-Islami posts on Facebook about Muslims**: Tabligh Jamaat is a global Islamic missionary movement that focuses on urging Muslims to return to practicing their religion as it was practiced during the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. They are known to use various platforms, including social media, to share their messages. However, the specific nature of the posts mentioned in the claim is not detailed, making it difficult to verify without more context.

2. **Indian industrialist BR Sethi is blacklisted by the Dubai government**: BR Shetty (often spelled Sethi) is an Indian-born businessman who founded NMC Health and other enterprises in the UAE. There have been reports of financial troubles and legal issues involving BR Shetty, including investigations and travel bans. However, the term ""blacklisted"" can be interpreted in various ways, and without specific details, it's challenging to confirm this part of the claim definitively.

Given the lack of specific evidence and context for both parts of the claim, it is difficult to verify the entire statement as true or false. 

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
This road was damaged in the picture because of the cyclone Amphn,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""This road was damaged in the picture because of the cyclone Amphn,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Existence of Cyclone Amphan**: Cyclone Amphan was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused significant damage in May 2020, particularly in India and Bangladesh.

2. **Damage Caused by Cyclone Amphan**: Cyclone Amphan did cause extensive damage to infrastructure, including roads, in the affected regions.

3. **Verification of the Picture**: Without the actual picture, it is impossible to verify if the specific road damage shown is directly attributable to Cyclone Amphan.

Given the information available, we can confirm that Cyclone Amphan did cause road damage, but we cannot verify the specific picture in question.

Some Muslim people say CAA-NRC is not wrong.,mostly false,bn,"The claim ""Some Muslim people say CAA-NRC is not wrong"" can be evaluated based on the fact that opinions on political and social issues can vary widely within any community, including the Muslim community. It is plausible that there are some individuals within the Muslim community who support or do not oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in India. Therefore, the statement is not an absolute claim about the entire Muslim community but rather acknowledges the existence of diverse opinions.

"In the video, a huge waterfall water is seen falling on the Shivling.The video has been described as Pashupati Nath Temple in Nepal.",false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the details about the video and the location it describes. The Pashupatinath Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, located in Kathmandu, Nepal. It is known for its architectural beauty and religious significance, but it is not typically associated with a huge waterfall falling on a Shivling.

If the video shows a large waterfall directly falling on a Shivling, it is unlikely to be from the Pashupatinath Temple, as this temple does not feature such a natural phenomenon. The temple complex is situated on the banks of the Bagmati River, and while it has many shrines and smaller temples, a large waterfall is not part of its known features.

Therefore, based on the information available, the claim that the video is from the Pashupatinath Temple in Nepal is likely incorrect.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is bowing down the industrialist 'Adani's wife'.,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi is bowing down the industrialist 'Adani's wife',"" we need to consider the context and evidence available. 

1. **Context**: The phrase ""bowing down"" can be interpreted in various ways, such as a gesture of respect, a cultural greeting, or a symbolic act. Without specific context or visual evidence, it's challenging to ascertain the exact nature of the claim.

2. **Evidence**: There is no widely recognized or verified evidence, such as photographs, videos, or credible news reports, that supports the claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has bowed down to Adani's wife in a manner that would be newsworthy or significant.

3. **Credibility**: The claim appears to be sensational and lacks substantiation from reliable sources. It is important to rely on credible news outlets and verified information when assessing such claims.

Given the lack of evidence and the potential for misinterpretation, the claim does not hold up to scrutiny.

1. **Clarity and Specificity**: The claim is vague and lacks specific details. It does not explain what ""1000 work"" means or what kind of ""goodness"" the audio clip provides.

2. **Evidence and Verification**: There is no evidence provided to support the claim that listening to the audio clip will result in ""goodness"" for you and your family. Without evidence, the claim cannot be verified.

3. **Context and Relevance**: The context in which the claim is made is unclear. It is not specified what the audio clip contains or why it would be beneficial.

Given the lack of clarity, evidence, and context, the claim cannot be substantiated.

1. **Source Verification**: Check the credibility of the source that shared the video. Reliable news outlets or official statements from authorities can provide context.

1. **Paul Pogba's Retirement**: As of the latest information available, Paul Pogba has not officially announced his retirement from football. He continues to play professionally.

2. **Protest Against French President's Statement**: There have been instances where athletes, including Pogba, have expressed their views on political and social issues.

Without additional context or specific details about the photo, I cannot definitively assess the claim. However, if we are to assume that the photo in question has indeed been widely shared and recognized, the claim could be considered 'True.'

Sushma Swaraj said that not a single man died in Balakot AIRRIC,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Sushma Swaraj said that not a single man died in Balakot AIRRIC,"" we need to verify the statement made by Sushma Swaraj and the context in which it was made.

Sushma Swaraj, who was the External Affairs Minister of India, did make a statement regarding the Balakot airstrike conducted by the Indian Air Force on February 26, 2019. The airstrike targeted a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) training camp in Balakot, Pakistan, in response to the Pulwama terror attack.

In her statement, Sushma Swaraj mentioned that the airstrike was carried out in a manner that ensured no civilian casualties. However, she did not explicitly state that ""not a single man died."" The Indian government claimed that the airstrike targeted and killed a significant number of terrorists, but there were no civilian casualties.

Given this context, the claim that ""Sushma Swaraj said that not a single man died in Balakot AIRRIC"" is not accurate. She did not make such a specific statement about no one dying; rather, she emphasized the absence of civilian casualties.

2. **Content Relevance**: Does the image provide scientifically valid information about emotional stress?
3. **Expert Consensus**: Is the image recognized by the scientific community as a useful tool for understanding emotional stress?

Without specific details about the image in question, it is challenging to verify the claim fully. However, if we assume that the image is widely circulated on social media or similar platforms without proper attribution or scientific backing, it is likely that the claim is exaggerated or misleading.

Given the lack of specific evidence supporting the claim and the potential for misinformation, the most appropriate classification would be:

2. **Action of Walking**: The octopus is described as ""walking.""
3. **Location**: The octopus is said to be on the ""edge of the sea.""

If the video indeed shows an octopus moving in a manner that can be described as walking (using its tentacles to move along a surface) and this occurs at the boundary between land and sea (the edge of the sea), then the claim would be accurate.

Given that octopuses are known to exhibit such behavior, especially in intertidal zones where they can move between water and land, the claim is plausible.

The claim that the ""Ram Bridge"" (also known as Adam's Bridge or Rama's Bridge) is seen through satellite due to low environmental pollution is false. The visibility of Adam's Bridge in satellite images is not primarily due to low environmental pollution but rather because it is a natural chain of limestone shoals and sandbanks that are physically present and can be captured by satellite imagery. The clarity of satellite images can be influenced by various factors, including weather conditions and the resolution of the satellite, but not specifically by environmental pollution levels.",,False,True

2. **Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic)**: We need to verify if this faction exists and if it is led by the mentioned individual.
3. **Camp Arranged by Sukhbir Badal**: We need to check if there has been any recent camp organized by Sukhbir Badal and if Bharadev Singh Dhandev Singh Dhangasa had any involvement in arranging it.

Upon researching:

1. **Bharadev Singh Dhandev Singh Dhangasa**: There is no verifiable information or records of a person by this name holding the positions mentioned.
2. **Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic)**: This faction does not appear to be a recognized or prominent faction within the Shiromani Akali Dal.
3. **Sukhbir Badal**: He is a prominent leader of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), but there is no evidence linking him to any camp arranged by the aforementioned individual.

"Long mask use may cause hypoxia, oxygen deficiency, fatigue and reducing verbs.",mostly false,bn,"The claim that ""Long mask use may cause hypoxia, oxygen deficiency, fatigue and reducing verbs"" is not supported by scientific evidence. 

1. **Hypoxia and Oxygen Deficiency**: Multiple studies have shown that wearing masks, including N95 respirators, does not significantly affect oxygen levels or cause hypoxia in healthy individuals. Masks are designed to be breathable and do not restrict oxygen intake or cause carbon dioxide buildup to dangerous levels.

2. **Fatigue**: While some individuals may feel discomfort or mild fatigue from prolonged mask use, this is generally due to the physical sensation of wearing the mask rather than any significant physiological impact on oxygen or carbon dioxide levels.

3. **Reducing Verbs**: This part of the claim is unclear and seems unrelated to any known physiological effects of mask-wearing. It might be a typographical error or a misunderstanding.

Given the lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim and the presence of misinformation, the statement is:

1. ""Tirpude, Tirpude, sells the world and the child"" - This part is ambiguous and lacks context. It is unclear what ""sells the world and the child"" means, and there is no verifiable information to support or refute this statement.

2. ""and took care of the child"" - This part is also vague and lacks specific details. Without additional context or evidence, it is difficult to verify.

3. ""and passed the MPSC PSI exam"" - The Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) conducts exams for various positions, including Police Sub-Inspector (PSI). However, there is no specific information available to verify whether someone named Tirpude passed this exam.

4. ""by studying from Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University"" - Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU) is a recognized institution that offers various courses.

Harshvardhan Patil has given a message to the BJP by entering the BJP.,false,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Harshvardhan Patil has given a message to the BJP by entering the BJP,"" we need to analyze the logical consistency and factual basis of the statement.

1. **Logical Consistency**: The statement suggests that Harshvardhan Patil has communicated something to the BJP by joining the BJP. However, this is inherently contradictory because one cannot send a message to a group by becoming part of that group. The act of joining a group is not typically considered a form of sending a message to that same group.

2. **Factual Basis**: If Harshvardhan Patil has indeed joined the BJP, the factual part of the statement is correct. However, the interpretation that this act sends a message to the BJP itself is logically flawed.

1. **Context and Source Verification**: 
   - Check reliable news sources, official statements, or speeches by Amit Shah to see if he made this statement.

   - Look for similar statements made by Amit Shah regarding the importance of national service and the respect for martyrs.

Based on the above steps, if no reliable source confirms that Amit Shah made this exact statement, or if it is found to be a misinterpretation, the claim would be considered false.

Beef spices in Maggie are being sold in India,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Beef spices in Maggie are being sold in India,"" we need to consider the context and available information about Maggi products in India.

1. **Maggi Products in India**: Maggi is a popular brand in India, primarily known for its instant noodles. The flavoring used in Maggi noodles in India is typically vegetarian, as the majority of the population in India follows vegetarian dietary practices, and beef is a particularly sensitive issue due to religious sentiments.

2. **Regulatory and Cultural Context**: In India, food products containing beef are subject to strict regulations and are often avoided by major food brands to cater to the predominantly Hindu population, which considers cows sacred. Nestlé, the company that owns the Maggi brand, is aware of these cultural sensitivities and markets its products accordingly.

3. **Official Statements and Ingredients**: Nestlé India has consistently stated that Maggi noodles sold in India are vegetarian. The ingredient lists on Maggi products in India do not include beef or beef-derived spices.

"A picture of a hospital in Bihar, in which patients are kept in a ward filled with water.Korona patients are being treated in Bihar in this situation.",half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""A picture of a hospital in Bihar, in which patients are kept in a ward filled with water. Korona patients are being treated in Bihar in this situation,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The authenticity of the picture.
2. The location of the hospital (Bihar).
3. The condition of the ward (filled with water).
4. The treatment of COVID-19 (referred to as ""Korona"") patients in such conditions.

Without access to the specific picture and additional context, it is challenging to verify all these points definitively. However, there have been reports and images in the past showing poor conditions in some hospitals in Bihar, including issues with waterlogging. 

Given the general context and previous reports, it is plausible that such a situation could occur, but without the specific picture and direct verification, it is not possible to confirm the exact details of this claim.

A collage of a three photo in which dozens of dead cows are seen.These pictures have been described as India.,half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and origin of the photos in the collage. This involves checking if the photos are indeed from India and if they depict dozens of dead cows as described.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the photos have been sourced from credible news outlets or official reports that confirm the location and context.
2. **Context Analysis**: Determine if the photos are recent and relevant to the claim, or if they have been taken out of context or misrepresented.
3. **Cross-Referencing**: Look for any fact-checking articles or reports that have analyzed these specific photos.

Without access to the actual photos and additional context, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the photos are accurately described and have been verified by credible sources, the claim could be considered true. If there is any doubt or evidence that the photos are misrepresented or taken out of context, the claim would be false or mostly false.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I will base my response on the need for further verification.

1. **News Reports**: Look for any recent news articles or reports from reputable news organizations that confirm or deny this claim.
2. **Official Statements**: Check for any statements from Yogi Adityanath or his office addressing this specific claim.
3. **Eyewitness Accounts**: Verify if there are credible eyewitness accounts or videos that support or refute the claim.

Without access to real-time data and verification from reliable sources, it is not possible to definitively categorize the claim. However, distributing money to voters is generally considered illegal under Indian election laws, and such actions would likely be widely reported and scrutinized.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the query, I cannot verify the claim's accuracy.

"If the hot steam is taken for a week, the corona may be destroyed",false,mr,"Final Answer: False

The claim that taking hot steam for a week can destroy the coronavirus is not supported by scientific evidence.

1. **Check Official Announcements**: Verify if there was an official announcement by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray regarding a lockdown in Maharashtra for the specified period.
2. **Historical Context**: Review the timeline of lockdowns in Maharashtra during the COVID-19 pandemic to see if these dates align with any known lockdown periods.

Based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2021, there was no specific lockdown announced by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for the exact period from June 15 to September 30. Lockdowns and restrictions were implemented at various times, but the exact dates mentioned in the claim do not match any known official announcements.

1. ""A video viral on the Social Media Platform is being viral with a speedy faster.""
   - This part of the claim is vague and redundant. It states that a video is going viral quickly, but it does not provide any specific details or evidence.

2. ""The crowd of people in the viral video can be seen that the crowd is being seen that millions of railway employees in the country have been respected by millions of railway employees.""
   - This part of the claim is confusing and poorly constructed. It suggests that a crowd in the video is showing respect to millions of railway employees, but it is not clear how this is being demonstrated or verified.

Given the lack of clarity, specific details, and verifiable evidence in the claim, it is difficult to ascertain its truthfulness. The statement is ambiguous and does not provide enough information to be deemed accurate.

3. The Hindu girl's reaction to this discovery.
4. The existence and content of a video related to this incident.

"Vikas Dubey, who shot to some policemen, including SP, works with almost all parties.",half true,gu,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the details about Vikas Dubey and his political affiliations.

Vikas Dubey was a notorious gangster from Uttar Pradesh, India, who was involved in numerous criminal activities. He gained significant notoriety after the Kanpur encounter in July 2020, where he and his associates ambushed and killed eight policemen, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP).

Regarding his political affiliations, it is known that Vikas Dubey had connections with various political figures over the years. He had been associated with different political parties at different times, leveraging these connections to protect his criminal activities. However, saying he ""works with almost all parties"" might be an overstatement, as it implies a formal and active collaboration with a wide range of political parties, which is not substantiated by concrete evidence.

Given this context, the claim that ""Vikas Dubey, who shot to some policemen, including SP, works with almost all parties"" is an exaggeration of his political connections.

The child died after talking to mobile charging,false,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The child died after talking to mobile charging,"" we need to consider the plausibility and any available evidence or reports of such incidents.

1. **Plausibility**: It is technically possible for a person to be electrocuted if they are using a mobile phone while it is charging, especially if the charger or the electrical outlet is faulty. However, such incidents are extremely rare and usually involve specific circumstances, such as the use of non-standard or damaged chargers.

2. **Evidence**: There have been isolated reports in the media of individuals being electrocuted while using mobile phones that are charging, but these cases are not common and often involve additional factors like water exposure or defective equipment.

Given the rarity and the specific conditions required for such an incident to occur, the claim is not entirely baseless but is highly unlikely under normal circumstances.

This involves checking for any official statements, credible news reports, or other reliable sources that confirm the involvement of the Indian Army in the bridge-making activity shown in the video.

Without access to the specific video and additional context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if the video has been widely reported and confirmed by credible sources as showing the Indian Army constructing a bridge, then the claim would be 'True'. Conversely, if there is no evidence or if the video has been debunked, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information and context in this scenario, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to verify such claims:

1. Look for official statements from the Indian Army or government sources.

"By giving a picture of the camera crew at the time of cleaning the middle of PM Modi, such an indication that this is a 'photo-up'",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the context and evidence surrounding the situation described. The claim suggests that a picture of the camera crew cleaning the middle of PM Modi indicates that the event was staged as a 'photo-op'.

1. **Context**: PM Modi has been involved in various cleanliness drives and public events where media coverage is common.
2. **Evidence**: If there is a picture showing the camera crew cleaning the area around PM Modi, it could imply that the scene was prepared for a photo opportunity. However, without additional context or evidence, such as statements from the crew or organizers, it is difficult to definitively conclude the intent behind the scene.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to fully support or refute the claim, it falls into a category where it is partially supported but not conclusively proven.

Video of policeman beating on stopping the lockdown.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Video of policeman beating on stopping the lockdown,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context**: The claim suggests that a video exists showing a policeman beating someone in the context of enforcing or stopping a lockdown. This implies a specific scenario related to lockdown enforcement.

2. **Verification**: To verify this claim, we would need to find the specific video in question and confirm its authenticity, the context in which it was recorded, and whether it indeed shows a policeman beating someone in relation to a lockdown.

3. **Sources**: Reliable sources such as news reports, official statements, or verified social media accounts would be necessary to confirm the details of the video.

Without access to the specific video and additional context, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that such videos have circulated during various lockdowns globally, it is plausible that some videos might show such incidents, but each case would need individual verification.

No one died in Israel because of the tea mixed with lemon and baking soda in tea,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""No one died in Israel because of the tea mixed with lemon and baking soda in tea,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Medical Evidence**: There is no widely known or documented medical evidence suggesting that a mixture of tea, lemon, and baking soda is lethal. These ingredients are commonly consumed in various forms around the world.

2. **Reported Incidents**: There are no credible reports or documented cases of deaths in Israel specifically attributed to the consumption of tea mixed with lemon and baking soda.

3. **Toxicity**: Lemon and baking soda are generally safe for consumption in moderate amounts. While excessive consumption of baking soda can lead to health issues, it is unlikely to be fatal in the context of a typical beverage.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim that such a mixture has caused deaths in Israel, the claim appears to be unfounded.

Chanod - A beautiful scene of Malhar Ghat.The Narmada river in its original form.Namo Namami Narmad side,false,gu,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Chanod**: Chanod is a village in the Vadodara district of Gujarat, India.
2. **Malhar Ghat**: This is a specific location along the Narmada River.
3. **The Narmada river in its original form**: This phrase is somewhat ambiguous but could imply the river in a natural, unaltered state.
4. **Namo Namami Narmad side**: This seems to be a phrase of reverence or a greeting towards the Narmada River.

Given that Chanod is indeed a location near the Narmada River and Malhar Ghat is a known ghat (a series of steps leading down to a body of water) on the Narmada, the claim about the scene being beautiful is subjective but plausible. The phrase ""Namo Namami Narmad side"" appears to be a respectful greeting or acknowledgment of the river.

Claimed to have a three -eyed baby born in Germany,false,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a three-eyed baby was born in Germany, we need to consider the credibility of the sources and the scientific plausibility of such an event. 

1. **Scientific Plausibility**: The occurrence of a three-eyed baby would be an extremely rare congenital anomaly. While there are documented cases of various congenital anomalies, a third eye is not a common or well-documented condition in medical literature.

2. **Credibility of Sources**: If the claim comes from reputable medical journals, news outlets, or verified scientific reports, it would lend more credibility to the claim. However, if the claim originates from dubious sources, tabloids, or social media without verification, it is less likely to be true.

3. **Verification**: There should be verifiable evidence such as medical records, statements from medical professionals, or photographic evidence that can be authenticated.

Given the extraordinary nature of the claim and the lack of verifiable evidence from credible sources, it is highly likely that this claim is not true.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
Policemen for poster against citizenship amendment law,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Policemen for poster against citizenship amendment law,"" we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding it. 

1. **Context**: The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India has been a subject of significant controversy and protest. Various groups, including students, activists, and political parties, have expressed opposition to the law. However, it is less common for law enforcement officers, such as policemen, to publicly take a stance against government policies due to their role in maintaining law and order.

2. **Evidence**: There have been instances where individual policemen have been seen supporting or opposing various causes, but these are usually personal actions rather than official stances. If there is documented evidence of policemen collectively or officially endorsing a poster against the CAA, it would support the claim. Conversely, if no such evidence exists or if the claim is based on isolated incidents, it would weaken the claim.

Given the lack of specific, verifiable evidence in the provided information, and considering the general role of policemen in maintaining neutrality in public protests, the claim appears to be misleading.

1. **Verification of Events**: Check credible news sources, official statements, and reports from human rights organizations to confirm if there have been documented instances of male policemen torturing women protesters in Assam.

2. **Context and Specificity**: Understand the context in which the claim is made. Are there specific incidents or general allegations? Are there any legal or governmental responses to such claims?

3. **Eyewitness Accounts and Evidence**: Look for eyewitness accounts, video evidence, or photographic evidence that can substantiate the claim.

4. **Official Responses**: Consider any official responses or denials from the police or government authorities in Assam.

Without access to real-time data and specific evidence, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the need for thorough verification and the potential for misinformation, we should be cautious.

The Audumbar tree, also known as Ficus racemosa or the cluster fig tree, does produce flowers, but they are typically enclosed within the fig itself and are not visible in the traditional sense.

Given that the flowers of the Audumbar tree are not externally visible and are enclosed within the fig, it is unlikely that there is a conventional photo of the flower itself. However, there may be images of the fig that contains the flowers.

Without access to specific evidence or footage, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a specific event or film that can be verified through reliable sources, we would need to cross-check those sources.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, I do not have specific information about the exact dates for the CBSE results for the year in question. However, the claim states that the twelfth class results will be announced on July 11 and the tenth class results on July 13.

Given that the CBSE typically announces results around this time of year, the dates mentioned could be plausible. However, without specific confirmation from an official CBSE announcement or a reliable source, I cannot definitively verify the exact dates.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
RSS 'Guard of Honor' is giving Queen Elizabeth.,false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""RSS 'Guard of Honor' is giving Queen Elizabeth,"" we need to consider the context and the organizations involved.

1. **RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh)**: The RSS is a Hindu nationalist organization in India. It is not a governmental or military body, and it does not have a formal role in state ceremonies or international diplomatic protocols.

2. **Guard of Honor**: A Guard of Honor is a ceremonial practice typically performed by military or police forces to honor dignitaries, including heads of state. It is a formal and official act.

3. **Queen Elizabeth**: As a head of state, Queen Elizabeth II would receive a Guard of Honor from official state or military bodies, not from non-governmental organizations like the RSS.

Given these points, the claim that the RSS is giving a Guard of Honor to Queen Elizabeth is highly unlikely and does not align with established protocols for such ceremonies.

The person seen in the picture kills Kerala's pregnant elephant in a bomb in pineapple,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the available evidence and context surrounding the incident involving the death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala, India, in 2020. The elephant died after consuming a pineapple filled with explosives, which led to widespread outrage and condemnation.

However, identifying the specific individual responsible for the act requires concrete evidence, such as an official investigation report or a legal conviction. Without such evidence, it is not possible to definitively state that the person seen in the picture is the one who committed the crime.

"This will benefit in the long run, is such a message on or is it time ???",half true,gu,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""This will benefit in the long run, is such a message on or is it time ???,"" we need to break down the statement and analyze its components.

1. ""This will benefit in the long run"" - This part of the statement is a general claim that something will have long-term benefits. Without specific context, it's difficult to assess the truthfulness of this claim. However, it is a common assertion that can be true in many scenarios.

2. ""is such a message on or is it time ???"" - This part of the statement is unclear and ambiguous. It seems to be questioning whether a message is currently relevant or timely, but the phrasing is confusing and lacks clarity.

Given the ambiguity and lack of context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the general nature of the first part and the unclear nature of the second part, we can make an assessment.

However, the statement appears to be a mix of transliterated words and possibly some errors or typos, making it difficult to interpret accurately.

1. ""'70 Salo Tak Hame"" could be interpreted as ""For 70 years we...""
2. ""Pakishtan's Lahka Lahara Khara Chhaya"" is unclear and seems to be a mix of words that do not form a coherent phrase in any known language.
3. ""Handstrain"" is an English word but does not fit contextually with the rest of the statement.

Given the lack of clarity and coherence in the statement, it is not possible to verify its truthfulness or relevance to any factual information.

The Indian Sankriti Mahima in Neujiland.,false,gu,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Indian Sankriti Mahima in Neujiland,"" we need to break down the components:

1. **Indian Sankriti Mahima**: This phrase appears to be a mix of Hindi and English. ""Sankriti"" could be a misspelling or variation of ""Sanskriti,"" which means ""culture"" in Hindi. ""Mahima"" means ""glory"" or ""greatness."" So, ""Indian Sankriti Mahima"" could be interpreted as ""The Glory of Indian Culture.""

2. **Neujiland**: This seems to be a misspelling or variation of ""New Zealand.""

Given these interpretations, the claim could be suggesting that there is a notable presence or influence of Indian culture in New Zealand. 

- **Indian Culture in New Zealand**: There is indeed a significant Indian community in New Zealand, and Indian culture is celebrated through various festivals, cultural events, and community activities. This includes Diwali celebrations, Indian cuisine, Bollywood movies, and more.

Considering the above points, the claim ""The Indian Sankriti Mahima in Neujiland"" can be interpreted as ""The Glory of Indian Culture in New Zealand,"" which is a reasonable statement given the presence and influence of Indian culture in New Zealand.

Without access to specific evidence or sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to assess such claims:

1. **Check News Reports:** Look for reports from reputable news organizations that have investigated the claim.

Then today, see the Narmada-water falling down from the mountain of a marble mountain, 25 km from Jabalpur City in Madhya Pradesh.Due to this waterfall, fog produces here, so that this waterfall is called a dungeon.",half true,gu,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **Bathing in the Ganges, performing Yamuna-water, while Narmada only washed with sin**: This part seems to be a cultural or religious belief. In Hinduism, the Ganges River is considered highly sacred and bathing in it is believed to purify one's sins. The Yamuna River also holds religious significance. The Narmada River is also considered holy, and there are beliefs associated with its purifying properties. However, the specific claim that the Narmada only ""washed with sin"" is not a widely recognized or documented belief.

2. **Narmada-water falling down from the mountain of a marble mountain, 25 km from Jabalpur City in Madhya Pradesh**: This refers to the Dhuandhar Falls, which is a famous waterfall on the Narmada River located near Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. The falls are indeed known for their scenic beauty and the mist (fog) they create, which gives them the name ""Dhuandhar"" (meaning ""smoke cascade"").

3. **Due to this waterfall, fog produces here, so that this waterfall is called a dungeon**: The term ""dungeon"" seems to be a mistranslation or misinterpretation. The correct term is ""Dhuandhar,"" which means ""smoke cascade,"" referring to the mist created by the waterfall.

Given these points:

- The cultural/religious belief part is not entirely accurate or universally accepted.
- The geographical and descriptive part about the Dhuandhar Falls is accurate, except for the mistranslation of ""dungeon.""

"If the mask is used for longer, the person may have the possibility of death.",false,mr,"Final Answer: Mostly False

The claim that using a mask for longer periods may lead to the possibility of death is largely unsubstantiated. Masks, such as surgical masks or cloth masks, are designed to be worn for extended periods without causing harm. While prolonged use might cause discomfort or minor issues like skin irritation, there is no credible evidence to suggest that it could lead to death. However, certain specialized masks, like those used in industrial settings, might have specific guidelines for safe usage durations, but these are exceptions rather than the rule.",,False,True
"Recently, the family of late singer SP Balasubramaniam was not able to pay the hospital bill.The central government helped after the Tamil Nadu government refused.",false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Whether the family of the late singer SP Balasubramaniam was unable to pay the hospital bill.
2. Whether the Tamil Nadu government refused to help.
3. Whether the central government stepped in to help.

SP Balasubramaniam, a renowned Indian playback singer, passed away on September 25, 2020. There were no widely reported or credible news sources indicating that his family faced financial difficulties in paying his hospital bills. Additionally, there were no reports suggesting that the Tamil Nadu government refused to help or that the central government intervened to pay the bills.

"How China's soldiers attack Indian soldiers, see videos",half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""How China's soldiers attack Indian soldiers, see videos,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source Verification**: The credibility of the source providing the videos is crucial. Reliable news agencies, official government releases, or verified footage from credible sources would lend more weight to the claim.

2. **Context and Content**: The context in which the videos were recorded and the content of the videos themselves need to be examined. Are the videos showing actual confrontations between Chinese and Indian soldiers? Are they recent or from past incidents?

3. **Cross-Verification**: Cross-referencing with multiple sources, including news reports, official statements from both countries, and independent verification, is necessary to confirm the authenticity of the videos.

4. **Historical Incidents**: There have been documented skirmishes between Chinese and Indian soldiers, such as the Galwan Valley clash in June 2020. Videos from such incidents might be used to support the claim.

Without specific videos to analyze and verify, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given the historical context of border tensions and documented incidents, it is plausible that videos exist showing confrontations.

It is being said with a video that Indians in Spain took out a procession in support of the construction of Ram temple.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Indians in Spain took out a procession in support of the construction of Ram temple,"" we need to verify the authenticity of the video and the context in which it was recorded. This involves checking credible news sources, fact-checking websites, and any available evidence that can confirm or refute the claim.

1. **Video Verification**: Analyze the video for any identifiable landmarks, language spoken, and any other contextual clues that can confirm it was indeed recorded in Spain.
2. **News Reports**: Look for any news articles or reports from reliable sources that mention such a procession by Indians in Spain.
3. **Fact-Checking Websites**: Check websites like Snopes, FactCheck.org, or any other reputable fact-checking organizations for any analysis they might have done on this claim.

Without access to the video and the ability to perform these checks directly, I can provide a general approach:

- If the video clearly shows identifiable landmarks in Spain and there are credible reports confirming the event, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'.
- If the video is ambiguous or there are no credible reports confirming the event, the claim could be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.
- If the video is proven to be from a different event or location, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the need for specific verification, I would recommend checking the latest updates from reliable sources to make an informed decision.

US President Donald Trump wanted to ruin Americans by making Corona virus a weapon.Thousands of people have hit the road in protest against this.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the available evidence and context:

1. **Intent to Weaponize COVID-19**: There is no credible evidence or verified reports that suggest former President Donald Trump intended to weaponize the coronavirus against Americans. The virus originated in Wuhan, China, and spread globally, leading to a pandemic. The U.S. government's response to the pandemic has been widely criticized, but this is different from intentionally weaponizing the virus.

2. **Protests**: There have been numerous protests in the United States related to the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including protests against lockdown measures, mask mandates, and other public health policies. However, these protests were generally about the government's response to the pandemic rather than a belief that the virus was intentionally weaponized by the President.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim that Donald Trump wanted to ruin Americans by making the coronavirus a weapon, and the fact that protests were more about the handling of the pandemic rather than this specific accusation, the claim is not supported by facts.

"The image of a plane on social media is being viral.The picture is being claimed that by the cost of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the cost of Rs. 8,600 crore.",false,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a plane costing Rs. 8,600 crore is associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we need to consider the context and details surrounding the purchase of such an aircraft.

1. **Context**: The Indian government did purchase two Boeing 777 aircraft for VVIP travel, which includes the Prime Minister, President, and other high-ranking officials. These aircraft are equipped with advanced security and communication systems.

2. **Cost**: The total cost for these aircraft, including modifications and security features, has been reported to be around Rs. 8,400 crore to Rs. 8,600 crore.

3. **Purpose**: These aircraft are not exclusively for Prime Minister Narendra Modi but are intended for use by various VVIPs in the Indian government.

Given this information, the claim that the plane costs Rs. 8,600 crore and is associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi is somewhat accurate but lacks the nuance that the aircraft is for broader VVIP use and not solely for the Prime Minister.

1. **Existence of Dr. Sharad Udawadia**: Dr. Sharad Udawadia is indeed a well-known doctor associated with Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai.

2. **Video Content**: There have been instances where videos or messages attributed to Dr. Sharad Udawadia have circulated on social media, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is crucial to verify if the specific video in question is authentic and if it contains accurate information.

3. **Virality**: The term ""viral"" can be subjective, but it generally means that the video has been widely shared and viewed across social media platforms.

Given the information available, it is important to cross-check with reliable sources or fact-checking websites to confirm the authenticity and content of the video.

Pictures committing violence of BJP workers in Bengal.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Pictures committing violence of BJP workers in Bengal,"" we need to verify the authenticity and context of the pictures in question. This involves checking credible news sources, fact-checking websites, and official statements.

1. **Verification of Sources**: Reliable news outlets and fact-checking organizations should be consulted to see if they have reported on incidents involving BJP workers committing violence in Bengal.
2. **Context of Images**: It's important to ensure that the images are not misrepresented or taken out of context. Sometimes images from unrelated events or different locations are falsely attributed to specific incidents.
3. **Official Statements**: Statements from law enforcement or government officials can provide additional context and verification.

Without specific images to analyze and verify, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if there have been credible reports and verified images showing BJP workers involved in violence in Bengal, the claim could be considered accurate. Conversely, if such evidence is lacking or the images are found to be misrepresented, the claim would be false.

Given the need for specific evidence and verification, and without access to the images in question, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general knowledge and the need for verification:

Bridge is ready within 24 hours of demolition in Japan.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Bridge is ready within 24 hours of demolition in Japan,"" we need to consider the context and the feasibility of such a rapid construction process.

1. **Context**: Japan is known for its advanced engineering and efficient construction techniques. There have been instances where infrastructure projects, including bridges, have been completed remarkably quickly. However, the claim that a bridge can be ready within 24 hours of demolition is quite extraordinary and would require specific examples or evidence to support it.

2. **Feasibility**: Constructing a bridge typically involves several stages, including planning, demolition, foundation work, assembly, and finishing. While Japan has demonstrated the ability to complete certain phases of construction very quickly, the entire process from demolition to a fully operational bridge within 24 hours is highly unlikely for most standard bridge projects.

3. **Evidence**: There are documented cases where Japan has completed significant infrastructure repairs or replacements rapidly, such as the repair of a large sinkhole in Fukuoka within a week. However, these examples do not necessarily translate to the complete demolition and reconstruction of a bridge within 24 hours.

Given the extraordinary nature of the claim and the lack of specific documented evidence supporting the complete process of bridge demolition and reconstruction within 24 hours, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is exaggerated.

1. **Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar and his wife**: Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar, also known as Babasaheb Ambedkar, was a prominent Indian jurist, economist, and social reformer. His wife's name was Ramabai Ambedkar.

2. **Picture of Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar and his wife**: There are indeed historical photographs of Dr. Ambedkar and his wife.

3. **Picture being seen as a picture of Dr. Bhimbad**: There is no known historical figure named Dr. Bhimbad. This seems to be a misidentification or a typographical error.

4. **Honored by the bus at Colombia**: This part of the claim is unclear and lacks context. There is no widely known or documented event where Dr. Ambedkar and his wife were specifically honored by a bus in Colombia.

5. **Their wife's picture has been imposed**: This suggests that the image has been altered or misrepresented, but without specific evidence or context, it's difficult to verify.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim and the presence of inaccuracies (such as the mention of Dr. Bhimbad), the claim appears to be largely incorrect.

The decorative video of the Ram Mandir Bhoomi Pujan Mandal in Ayodhya,half true,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The decorative video of the Ram Mandir Bhoomi Pujan Mandal in Ayodhya,"" we need to verify if such a video exists and if it is indeed related to the Ram Mandir Bhoomi Pujan ceremony in Ayodhya.

The Ram Mandir Bhoomi Pujan ceremony took place on August 5, 2020, in Ayodhya, marking the beginning of the construction of the Ram Mandir. This event was widely covered by media and various videos and images were circulated.

If the claim refers to a specific video that is known to be associated with the decorations or the ceremony itself, then it would be accurate. However, without additional context or specific details about the video in question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim.

1. **Verification of the Video**: Is there a specific video that is being referenced? If so, does it clearly show teachers who are 55 years old conducting an online class?
2. **Context and Source**: What is the source of the video? Is it from a credible source, and does it provide context that supports the claim?
3. **Content Analysis**: Does the video content match the description? Are the individuals in the video identified as 55-year-old teachers, and is it evident that they are conducting an online class?

Without specific details or a way to verify the video in question, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a real video that has been verified and matches the description, we could consider it true. Conversely, if there is no evidence or the video does not match the description, the claim would be false.

Given the lack of specific information to verify the claim, the most cautious approach is to consider it unverified.

Whether it is a lockdown or not: Six months must be taken by the Indian Council of Medical Research.,half true,gu,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand the context and the specifics of what is being asserted. The statement suggests that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) must take six months regardless of whether there is a lockdown or not. 

However, the claim is vague and lacks context. It does not specify what the six months are for—whether it is for conducting research, implementing measures, or something else. Additionally, there is no widely known or documented rule or guideline that mandates the ICMR to take exactly six months for any specific task irrespective of a lockdown.

Given the lack of context and supporting evidence for such a specific and absolute claim, it is not accurate to state that the ICMR must take six months for any task regardless of a lockdown.

1. **Video on social media is viral**: This is a general statement and could be true or false depending on the context and platform.
2. **Persons wearing a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in his throat**: This phrase is unclear. It might mean people wearing BJP scarves or symbols around their necks.
3. **They can be discussed dancing**: This is grammatically incorrect but seems to imply that the people are dancing.
4. **The bill passed by the President**: This is a separate statement and needs context. Which bill is being referred to?
5. **Upon settlement, the slopes celebrated Bhangra in Amritsar and distributed the luddon**: This is also unclear. ""Slopes"" might be a mistranslation or typo. ""Luddon"" is not a recognized term.

Given the unclear and potentially mistranslated or incorrect elements in the claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy without additional context or clarification.

The video is to turn off the corona ward in New Zealand,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The video is to turn off the corona ward in New Zealand,"" we need to verify the context and content of the video in question. This involves checking reliable sources for any announcements or news regarding the closure of COVID-19 wards in New Zealand.

1. **Verification of the Video**: Without the actual video, it's challenging to verify its content directly. However, we can look for recent news or official statements from New Zealand health authorities.

2. **Current COVID-19 Situation in New Zealand**: As of the latest updates, New Zealand has been managing COVID-19 cases with various measures, including the operation of COVID-19 wards in hospitals. Any significant change, such as the closure of these wards, would likely be reported in the news.

3. **Official Announcements**: Checking the Ministry of Health New Zealand's website or recent press releases can provide information on whether there has been an official decision to close COVID-19 wards.

Given the lack of specific details about the video and the need for more context, it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim without further information. However, based on the general approach to managing COVID-19, it is unlikely that all COVID-19 wards would be turned off without significant public communication.

1. **Image Verification**: We need to confirm if the images are real and not digitally altered or taken from different contexts.
2. **Context Verification**: We need to ensure that the images accurately depict the state of the Ganga Ghat during the Congress period and the Modi period.
3. **Source Verification**: We need to verify if a Facebook page actually posted these images with the given captions.

Without access to the specific images and the Facebook post, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the information provided, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the nature of social media and the frequent use of images to make political statements, it is possible that the images could be selectively chosen or edited to support a particular narrative. Therefore, without concrete evidence, we should approach the claim with skepticism.

Bhutan has stopped giving water to Indian farmers in Assam for irrigation.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Bhutan has stopped giving water to Indian farmers in Assam for irrigation,"" we need to look at the context and available information.

In June 2020, there were reports that Bhutan had stopped the supply of irrigation water to farmers in Assam. However, Bhutan clarified that the disruption was due to maintenance work on the irrigation channels and not a deliberate act to stop water supply. Bhutan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the maintenance work was necessary and that the water supply would resume once the work was completed.

Given this context, the claim that Bhutan has stopped giving water to Indian farmers in Assam for irrigation is misleading without the additional context of the maintenance work.

2. **Context of the Photo**: Even if the photo is real, does it actually depict doctors and nurses who have died due to the coronavirus, or is it being misrepresented?
3. **Source Credibility**: The credibility of the source sharing the photo should be considered. Is it a reliable news outlet or an unverified social media post?

Given the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there have been numerous instances of misinformation and misattributed photos during the COVID-19 pandemic. Photos are often taken out of context or used to evoke emotional responses without accurate representation.

Without specific details about the photo in question, it is challenging to definitively verify its authenticity and context. However, based on the prevalence of misinformation, it is prudent to approach such claims with skepticism unless verified by credible sources.

Javed Haider, an actor who has worked in the Indian film industry, was indeed seen in a video selling vegetables during the COVID-19 lockdown. This video went viral, and it was reported that he was doing this to make ends meet due to the lack of work in the entertainment industry during the lockdown.

However, Javed Haider himself clarified that he was not actually selling vegetables out of necessity but was making a TikTok video to inspire people to work hard and not be ashamed of any job. He mentioned that he was not facing financial difficulties and was doing fine.

Given this context, the claim that he was selling vegetables due to unemployment is misleading.

2. ""In order to consolidate the world of Surung Desh.""
   - This phrase is unclear and seems to be a mistranslation or misinterpretation. It doesn't provide a clear or factual statement.

3. ""Bhava Milega""
   - This phrase is also unclear and seems to be out of context.

Given the information, the claim appears to be exaggerated and not entirely accurate. While Narendra Modi played a significant role in the completion and inauguration of the Atal Tunnel, it is not accurate to say he is the only one responsible for it.

The child in the picture is seeking shares and prayers on Facebook for his Covid-1 affected mother,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and details of the picture and the associated story. This involves checking reliable sources, fact-checking websites, and any available background information on the image and the situation described.

Without specific details or access to the image and its context, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the information provided and the common occurrence of such posts on social media, it is important to approach such claims with caution as they can sometimes be misleading or fabricated.

"The person who is visible in the viral video is informed of his son's guilty.At the same time, the person is talking to the maximum share of the post.",half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. ""The person who is visible in the viral video is informed of his son's guilty.""
2. ""At the same time, the person is talking to the maximum share of the post.""

The first part of the claim suggests that the person in the viral video is being informed about his son's guilt. The second part of the claim states that this person is simultaneously talking to the maximum share of the post.

Without additional context or evidence to verify these specific details, it is challenging to determine the exact truthfulness of the claim. However, the phrasing and the combination of events described seem somewhat implausible and unclear.

Given the lack of clarity and evidence, the claim appears to be mostly inaccurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Poor chariots, poor chariots will be converted into an express train on the way to the closure.",half true,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Poor chariots, poor chariots will be converted into an express train on the way to the closure,"" we need to analyze its components and context.

1. **Literal Interpretation**: Chariots and express trains are fundamentally different modes of transportation. Chariots are ancient, horse-drawn vehicles, while express trains are modern, high-speed rail systems. The idea of converting chariots into express trains is not feasible in a literal sense.

2. **Metaphorical Interpretation**: If we consider the statement metaphorically, it might imply a transformation from an outdated or less efficient system (chariots) to a modern, efficient one (express trains). The phrase ""on the way to the closure"" could suggest a final phase or endpoint of a process. However, without additional context, this interpretation remains speculative.

Given the lack of clarity and the implausibility of a literal transformation, the claim does not hold up under scrutiny.

2. Whether in that tweet, he referred to Xi Jinping as his 'boss'.

After researching, there is no verified information or credible source that confirms Sitaram Yechury made such a tweet on October 28 or referred to Xi Jinping as his 'boss'. This claim appears to be fabricated or misrepresented.

This picture of Bihar shows the 15 -year development of Nitish Raj.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""This picture of Bihar shows the 15-year development of Nitish Raj,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context of the Picture**: The claim is about a specific picture, but without seeing the picture, it's challenging to verify its content and context. The picture could be showing infrastructure, social development, or any other aspect of Bihar's development.

2. **Nitish Kumar's Tenure**: Nitish Kumar has served as the Chief Minister of Bihar for multiple terms, starting from 2005. As of 2023, he has been in power for approximately 15 years, though not continuously.

3. **Development in Bihar**: Under Nitish Kumar's leadership, Bihar has seen various developmental projects and improvements in infrastructure, education, and law and order. However, the extent and impact of these developments can be subjective and vary based on different sources and perspectives.

Given the lack of specific details about the picture and the subjective nature of assessing development, the claim cannot be fully verified or falsified without additional context.

The Punjab Government has been claimed that the Punjab Government has issued new instructions on the Lockdown.,half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Punjab Government has issued new instructions on the Lockdown,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there are any official announcements or press releases from the Punjab Government regarding new lockdown instructions.
2. **Date and Context**: Ensure that the information is current and relevant to the present context.
3. **Credibility**: Assess the credibility of the sources reporting this information.

Assuming we have verified these aspects and found that the Punjab Government has indeed issued new instructions on the lockdown, the claim would be 'True'. If there is no such evidence, the claim would be 'False'. If the information is partially correct or lacks some details, it could fall into the 'Mostly True', 'Half True', or 'Mostly False' categories.

Given the information provided and without additional context or verification, I cannot definitively determine the accuracy. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming it is a straightforward statement without any misleading elements, I would lean towards:

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"A picture of a child drinking milk on a railway track in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh.This shows the migrant crisis in India.",half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and details of the image in question. The claim suggests that the image depicts a child drinking milk on a railway track in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh, and that it illustrates the migrant crisis in India.

1. **Image Verification**: The image in question has been widely circulated and has been fact-checked by multiple sources. It shows a child drinking milk on a railway track, which indeed took place in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh.

2. **Context of the Image**: The image was taken during the COVID-19 lockdown in India when many migrant workers were stranded and forced to walk long distances to return to their home villages. This situation led to numerous hardships, including lack of food and water, and the image became symbolic of the migrant crisis during that period.

Given these points, the claim accurately describes the location, the subject of the image, and the broader context of the migrant crisis in India.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
A picture of a girl enlisted at Social Media and Hospital is being viruled that it is claiming that this girl has died.,false,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a picture of a girl enlisted at Social Media and Hospital is being virally shared with the claim that she has died, we would need to verify the following:

1. The authenticity of the picture.
2. The identity of the girl in the picture.
3. The current status of the girl (whether she is alive or deceased).
4. The source of the claim and its credibility.

Without specific details or evidence to verify these points, it is not possible to definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the information provided, we can make an educated guess.

Given that viral claims on social media can often be misleading or false, and without concrete evidence to support the claim, it is reasonable to approach this with skepticism.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
The design of the Ram Temple of Ayodhya is being seen in the picture,false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The design of the Ram Temple of Ayodhya is being seen in the picture,"" we need to consider the context and the source of the image. If the image in question is an officially released or widely recognized architectural rendering or model of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, then the claim would be accurate. However, if the image is not verified or is from an unofficial source, the claim could be misleading.

Given the information provided, I cannot verify the specific image being referred to. Therefore, I cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim without additional context or verification.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False

2. **Timing of the Images**: Were the images taken during Eid?
3. **Nature of the Event**: Do the images depict police persecution?

Without access to the specific images in question, I cannot definitively verify these details. However, I can provide a general approach to assess such claims:

- **Source Verification**: Check the source of the images. Reliable news outlets, official statements, or verified social media accounts can provide context.
- **Image Metadata**: If available, metadata can provide information about when and where the images were taken.
- **Cross-Referencing**: Compare the images with other known images or videos from the same event to see if they match.

Given the complexity and the need for specific evidence to verify the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer without further information.

Forty years later Bhajan Kirtan took place in Srinagar.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Forty years later Bhajan Kirtan took place in Srinagar,"" we need to verify the historical context and specific events related to Bhajan Kirtan in Srinagar.

1. **Historical Context**: Bhajan Kirtan is a form of devotional singing in Hinduism. Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, has a significant history of cultural and religious events.

2. **Specific Event**: The claim suggests a specific event took place 40 years after a certain point in time. Without a clear reference to the initial event or a specific date, it's challenging to verify the exact timeline.

3. **Recent News**: If the claim refers to a recent event, such as a Bhajan Kirtan happening in Srinagar after a long hiatus due to political or social reasons, it might be verifiable through recent news sources.

Given the lack of specific details and the need for a precise reference point, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted based on the provided information alone.

Shri Ram Nagar Ayodhya decoration Jayashriram,half true,gu,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Shri Ram Nagar Ayodhya decoration Jayashriram,"" we need to break down the components and verify each part:

1. **Shri Ram Nagar**: This could refer to a locality or area named after Lord Ram, which is plausible in a place like Ayodhya, a city deeply associated with Lord Ram in Hindu mythology.
2. **Ayodhya**: This is a well-known city in Uttar Pradesh, India, and is historically and religiously significant as the birthplace of Lord Ram.
3. **Decoration**: This term is vague but could refer to festive or religious decorations, which are common in Ayodhya, especially during festivals like Ram Navami or Diwali.
4. **Jayashriram**: This is a common chant or greeting among devotees of Lord Ram, translating to ""Victory to Lord Ram.""

Given the context, the claim seems to suggest that there is a place called Shri Ram Nagar in Ayodhya that is decorated, and the phrase ""Jayashriram"" is associated with it. While the specific existence of a locality named ""Shri Ram Nagar"" in Ayodhya is not verified, the rest of the elements are plausible and consistent with the cultural and religious practices in Ayodhya.

1. **Context**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments, including state governments in India, made announcements regarding the closure of educational institutions to curb the spread of the virus.

2. **Specifics**: The claim states that the Punjab Government announced something related to educational institutions by March 25 due to the coronavirus. 

3. **Verification**: 
   - The Punjab Government did indeed make several announcements regarding the closure of educational institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - The specific date of March 25, 2020, aligns with the period when many such announcements were made globally and in India.

Given the context and the general accuracy of the information, the claim appears to be largely correct, though it lacks some specific details about the nature of the announcement (e.g., whether it was a closure, reopening, or other measures).

A picture of social media is being viral in which people in large numbers are being seen in the large number of people where this picture is the farmers of Kisan Ordinance BillPerformed against.,half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify each part:

1. ""A picture of social media is being viral"" - This part suggests that a picture is widely circulating on social media. This is a common occurrence, but without specific evidence, we cannot confirm the virality of a particular picture.

2. ""in which people in large numbers are being seen"" - This part claims that the picture shows a large number of people. Again, without seeing the picture, we cannot verify this.

3. ""where this picture is the farmers of Kisan Ordinance BillPerformed against"" - This part claims that the people in the picture are farmers protesting against the Kisan Ordinance Bill. This is a specific claim that requires verification of the context and the identity of the people in the picture.

Given that we do not have the actual picture or additional context to verify these claims, we cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the statement. However, based on the structure and common occurrences of such events, we can make an educated guess.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
The claim is being claimed that the Aam Aadmi Party of Parliament Bhai Managar Mann said that the statement said Bhai Sada is revealed for all.,false,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify each part:

1. ""The Aam Aadmi Party of Parliament Bhai Managar Mann"" - This part is unclear and seems to mix up terms. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is a political party in India, but ""Parliament Bhai Managar Mann"" does not correspond to any known entity or individual associated with AAP.

2. ""said that the statement said Bhai Sada is revealed for all"" - This part is also confusing and lacks context. It is unclear what ""the statement said Bhai Sada is revealed for all"" means, and there is no known public statement or context that matches this description.

Given the lack of clarity and verifiable information in the claim, it is difficult to ascertain its truthfulness. The statement appears to be a mix of unrelated terms and lacks coherence.

Senior Congress leader Motilal Vora touched Rahul Gandhi's feet.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Senior Congress leader Motilal Vora touched Rahul Gandhi's feet,"" we need to verify the information from reliable sources.

1. **Context and Background**: Motilal Vora was a senior leader in the Indian National Congress, and Rahul Gandhi is a prominent figure in the same party. In Indian culture, touching the feet of elders or respected individuals is a common gesture of respect, but it is less common for elders to touch the feet of younger individuals.

2. **Verification**: A thorough search of credible news sources, official statements, and visual evidence (such as photographs or videos) is necessary to confirm this event. 

3. **Available Evidence**: If there are credible reports or visual evidence confirming that Motilal Vora did indeed touch Rahul Gandhi's feet, the claim would be true. Conversely, if there is no such evidence or if the evidence suggests otherwise, the claim would be false.

Given the cultural context and the positions of the individuals involved, it would be unusual for an elder like Motilal Vora to touch the feet of a younger person like Rahul Gandhi. However, without concrete evidence, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim.

**Research Outcome**: Based on available information and the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim is not substantiated.

2. ""of the hungry videos"" - This phrase is unclear and does not make logical sense. Videos cannot be ""hungry.""
3. ""in the hateful atmosphere of the United States"" - This is a broad and subjective statement. While there may be instances of hate in the United States, it is not universally applicable to the entire atmosphere of the country.

"After the NRC was implemented in Assam, the video of the police evacuate people from their house.",false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and details surrounding the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam and whether there were videos of police evacuating people from their houses.

1. **NRC Implementation in Assam**: The NRC was updated in Assam to identify Indian citizens and detect illegal immigrants. The final list was published on August 31, 2019.

2. **Evacuation by Police**: There have been reports and videos circulating on social media showing police action in Assam. However, these videos often need to be verified for authenticity and context. Some videos may be misrepresented or taken out of context.

3. **Verification**: Fact-checking organizations and news reports have investigated various claims about police evacuations. Some videos have been found to be unrelated to the NRC process or misrepresented.

Given the complexity and the need for precise verification, the claim that ""the video of the police evacuate people from their house"" directly correlates with the NRC implementation is not fully substantiated without specific evidence.

2. **News Reports**: Search for credible news reports or articles that mention the existence of such a video.
3. **Social Media and Public Platforms**: Investigate if there are any widely circulated videos on social media platforms that are specifically about EVMs in the context of the Bihar election.

Without access to real-time data, I cannot verify the claim directly. However, if such a video has been officially released or widely reported by credible sources, the claim would be 'True'. If there is no evidence or the video is unrelated to the Bihar election, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information provided here, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I would need more context or evidence to make an accurate determination.

2. **because a hotel did not give him a house**: This part of the claim suggests that the reason for his fall was that a hotel did not provide him with accommodation. This also seems highly unlikely and not supported by any credible sources.

Given the lack of evidence and the implausibility of the scenario described, the claim appears to be fabricated or a misinterpretation of events.

2. **Student's homemade home**: This implies that a student from Puducherry University has created a home using homemade methods or materials.
3. **By WHO**: This suggests that the World Health Organization (WHO) is involved in some capacity, either by endorsing, recognizing, or being associated with the homemade home.

Given the unusual phrasing and the lack of specific details, it is important to verify if there are any credible sources or news reports that confirm such an event or recognition by WHO.

"After the Christchurch Mosque attack, 5 Islam in New Zealand converted to Islam",false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""After the Christchurch Mosque attack, 5 Islam in New Zealand converted to Islam,"" we need to analyze the statement carefully.

1. **Context of the Christchurch Mosque Attack**: The Christchurch Mosque attack occurred on March 15, 2019, when a gunman targeted two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, resulting in the tragic loss of 51 lives.

2. **Conversion to Islam**: The claim suggests that after this attack, 5 individuals in New Zealand converted to Islam. 

3. **Verification**: There are reports and anecdotal evidence that some people were inspired to convert to Islam following the attack, as a show of solidarity and support for the Muslim community. However, the specific number ""5"" is not widely documented or verified in credible sources.

2. **Prime Minister Narendra Modi**: Narendra Modi has been the Prime Minister of India since May 2014. During his tenure, he has inaugurated multiple infrastructure projects, including bridges.

Without additional context or specific details about which bridge is being referred to, it is challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, given that Narendra Modi has inaugurated several bridges during his time in office, the statement as it stands is vague and potentially misleading.

"In the last five years, people have been persecuted in the BJP -ruled state.",false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In the last five years, people have been persecuted in the BJP-ruled state,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of Persecution**: Persecution typically refers to systematic mistreatment of an individual or group by another group. This can include harassment, discrimination, violence, and other forms of oppression.

2. **Evidence and Reports**: We need to look at credible sources such as human rights organizations, news reports, and government records to see if there have been documented cases of persecution in BJP-ruled states over the last five years.

3. **Context and Specificity**: The claim is broad and does not specify which BJP-ruled state or what kind of persecution is being referred to. BJP rules multiple states in India, and the situation can vary significantly from one state to another.

4. **Counterclaims and Rebuttals**: It is also important to consider any counterclaims or rebuttals from the BJP or other sources that might provide a different perspective on the situation.

Given the complexity and the need for specific evidence, a thorough investigation would be required to provide a definitive answer.

1. **Fireworks were to be held in Tokyo during the Olympics 2020**: This is true. Fireworks are a common feature in the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics.

2. **The fireworks were recently displayed in Mount Fuji, Japan**: There is no widely known or reported event where the fireworks intended for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were displayed at Mount Fuji.

3. **The fireworks could not be kept until next year**: Fireworks can generally be stored for a period of time if kept under proper conditions, but there is no specific information suggesting that the Tokyo 2020 fireworks had to be used immediately or could not be stored.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim that the fireworks were displayed at Mount Fuji and the questionable assertion about the inability to store them, the claim appears to be largely inaccurate.

Muslims are the majority of the names of the freedom fighters at the India Gate,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Muslims are the majority of the names of the freedom fighters at the India Gate,"" we need to consider the historical context and the actual inscriptions on the India Gate.

India Gate, located in New Delhi, is a war memorial dedicated to the soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. The names inscribed on the India Gate are those of soldiers who lost their lives in these conflicts, not specifically freedom fighters from the Indian independence movement.

Given this context, the claim that ""Muslims are the majority of the names of the freedom fighters at the India Gate"" is not accurate because the names inscribed are primarily those of soldiers from the British Indian Army, not freedom fighters. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that Muslims constitute a majority of these names.

Initial reports suggested that around 3,000 tonnes of gold could be found. However, the GSI later clarified that the actual estimated gold reserve was about 160 kg, not 3,000 tonnes.

Given this information, the claim that ""5 tonnes of gold was found in Uttar Pradesh"" is not accurate.

This involves checking reliable sources, news reports, and fact-checking websites to see if there is any evidence supporting the claim that RSS members, disguised in Indian Army uniforms, are kidnapping women in Kashmir.

Given the sensitivity and potential for misinformation in such claims, it is crucial to rely on verified information. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2021, there have been no credible reports or evidence supporting the claim that RSS members are kidnapping women in Kashmir while wearing Indian Army uniforms. Such claims are often spread to incite fear or political tension and should be approached with caution.

Jyoti Paswan was killed by a 120 -kilometer bike while sitting on a sick father during lockdown,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Jyoti Paswan**: She is a real person who gained attention during the COVID-19 lockdown in India.
2. **120-kilometer bike**: This part of the claim seems to be a misstatement. Jyoti Paswan actually cycled approximately 1,200 kilometers, not 120 kilometers.
3. **Sitting on a sick father**: This part is true. Jyoti Paswan cycled with her sick father on the back of her bicycle.
4. **Killed**: This part of the claim is false. Jyoti Paswan was not killed during this journey.

Given these points, the claim contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate information. The distance is incorrect, and the statement about her being killed is false.

The claim that leaving a sanitizer bottle in the car can cause a fire due to its alcohol content is mostly false. While it is true that hand sanitizers contain alcohol, which is flammable, the temperatures required to ignite the sanitizer are much higher than what a car can typically reach, even on a hot day. The risk of a fire starting from a hand sanitizer bottle left in a car is extremely low.

"After Nepal, the ghost now raises India's concerns, stopping irrigation water in Assam",false,gu,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""After Nepal, the ghost now raises India's concerns, stopping irrigation water in Assam,"" we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding it.

1. **Context of Nepal and Ghosts**: The phrase ""After Nepal, the ghost"" seems metaphorical or sensational. It might refer to a previous issue in Nepal that is now being compared to a new issue in Assam, but without specific details, it's hard to verify.

2. **Irrigation Water in Assam**: There have been instances where water management and irrigation issues have arisen in Assam, often due to natural factors like floods, droughts, or human activities like dam construction and water diversion. However, the claim that a ""ghost"" is responsible is clearly not factual.

3. **Verification**: To verify the claim, we would need credible sources or reports indicating that irrigation water has been stopped in Assam due to a specific, identifiable cause. The mention of a ""ghost"" is likely a figurative expression rather than a literal one.

Given the lack of concrete evidence and the figurative language used, the claim appears to be misleading.

1. Whether there was a monsoon session where this issue was discussed.
2. Whether the monthly pension of former MLAs was indeed increased.
3. The specific amounts involved in the increase (from 25 thousand to 40 thousand).

If all these points are confirmed, the claim would be 'True'. If some details are correct but not all, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If the claim is largely incorrect but has some element of truth, it might be 'Mostly False'. If the claim is entirely incorrect, it would be 'False'.

The claim appears to be a mix of unrelated and potentially incorrect information. Kangana Ranaut is an Indian actress, and there is no known event or occasion named ""Kangana Ranavat, 1000 Gadiyas of the Sath Karani Karani Sena Maharashtra Ravana."" Additionally, the phrase ""Jai Bhavani Jai Rajputana"" and ""Jai Shriram"" are slogans often used in different contexts, but they do not validate the claim made in the statement. Therefore, the claim is 'False'.",,False,True

1. **Location Verification**: We need to confirm if the picture was indeed taken in Haryana.
2. **Date Verification**: We need to confirm if the picture was taken on September 28 of the current year.

Without access to the specific picture and additional context or metadata, it is impossible to verify these details definitively. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm the claim.

It mentions the Chief Minister of Punjab, Bhagwant Mann, and Capt. Amarinder Singh, but it is not clear what the claim is about. It seems to suggest that there was a secret meeting involving these individuals, but the details are not coherent.

"This video is from Lonavla Bhus Dam and if people continue to behave like this, Korona will not go from India.",half true,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. The video is from Lonavla Bhus Dam.
2. If people continue to behave like this, Korona (COVID-19) will not go from India.

For the first part, without specific evidence or verification of the video's location, it is difficult to confirm if the video is indeed from Lonavla Bhus Dam. 

For the second part, the statement is a generalization about the behavior of people and its impact on the spread of COVID-19. While it is true that irresponsible behavior can contribute to the spread of the virus, the claim that COVID-19 will not go from India solely based on this behavior is an oversimplification. Public health measures, vaccination, and other factors also play significant roles.

Given the lack of specific evidence for the video's location and the generalized nature of the second part of the claim, the overall claim cannot be fully verified.

The National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) have been contentious issues in India, leading to various protests and rallies.

1. **Verification of the Video**: Check if the video in question is indeed from a rally in Delhi.
2. **Context of the Rally**: Confirm if the rally was specifically against NPR and NRC.
3. **Participants**: Verify if the participants in the rally were predominantly Muslim.

If the video matches all these criteria, the claim can be considered true. If it only partially matches, the claim might be partially true or false.

Municipalities and municipalities get Rs 1.5 lakh behind every corona patient,false,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Municipalities and municipalities get Rs 1.5 lakh behind every corona patient,"" we need to consider the context and available evidence.

1. **Government Funding Policies**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, various governments around the world, including India, allocated funds to municipalities and local bodies to manage the crisis. However, the specific amount and the mechanism of disbursement can vary widely.

2. **Verification from Official Sources**: There is no widely recognized or official policy that states municipalities receive a fixed amount of Rs 1.5 lakh for every COVID-19 patient. Government funding is typically more complex and may involve multiple factors, including the severity of the outbreak, the needs of the healthcare system, and other logistical considerations.

3. **Media and Reports**: If there were such a policy, it would likely be reported in credible news sources and official government releases. A thorough search in reliable news outlets and government announcements would be necessary to confirm this claim.

Given the lack of specific evidence supporting the claim and the complexity of government funding mechanisms, it is unlikely that municipalities receive a fixed amount of Rs 1.5 lakh for every COVID-19 patient.

1. **BJP Leaders and Dance Shows**: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a major political party in India, and its leaders are typically involved in political activities rather than entertainment shows like ""Dance India Dance.""

2. **Social Media Trends**: A thorough search of social media platforms and credible news sources would be necessary to confirm if there is any significant movement or request for BJP leaders to lead a dance show. 

3. **Credibility and Context**: The claim seems unusual and lacks context. It is important to consider the credibility of the sources making this claim.

Given the lack of evidence and the implausibility of the scenario, it is highly unlikely that such a claim is true.

Google has removed the control line from the Indian map,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Google has removed the control line from the Indian map,"" we need to consider the context and the specifics of the map in question. The ""control line"" typically refers to the Line of Control (LoC) between India and Pakistan or the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China.

Google Maps often displays different versions of maps depending on the user's location due to geopolitical sensitivities. For example, users in India might see the entire region of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India, while users in other countries might see it differently, with the LoC or LAC marked.

To verify this claim, one would need to check the current state of Google Maps from different regions and see if the control lines are indeed missing or altered.

Given the lack of specific, up-to-date information in this context, and considering Google's practice of showing different map versions based on user location, it is unlikely that Google has entirely removed the control lines globally.

Indian cricket team did not play matches in Guwahati in protest against CAA,false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the Indian cricket team did not play matches in Guwahati in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), we need to consider the context and available evidence.

1. **Context of CAA Protests**: The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was passed by the Indian Parliament in December 2019, leading to widespread protests across the country, including in Assam, where Guwahati is located.

2. **Scheduled Matches**: The Indian cricket team had a scheduled T20 match against Sri Lanka in Guwahati on January 5, 2020.

3. **Match Status**: The match in Guwahati was indeed scheduled and the teams arrived in the city. However, the match was abandoned due to rain and a wet outfield, not because of a protest by the Indian cricket team.

4. **Protests Impact**: While there were significant protests in Assam, including Guwahati, there is no verified evidence or official statement indicating that the Indian cricket team refused to play in Guwahati as a form of protest against the CAA.

Based on the above points, the claim that the Indian cricket team did not play matches in Guwahati in protest against the CAA is not supported by evidence.

This first Prime Minister runs the country for 5 years without borrowing any money from the World Bank,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""This first Prime Minister runs the country for 5 years without borrowing any money from the World Bank,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Identity of the Prime Minister**: The claim does not specify which country's first Prime Minister is being referred to. Different countries have different first Prime Ministers, and their financial policies and interactions with the World Bank vary.

2. **Historical Context**: The time period during which the first Prime Minister served is crucial. The World Bank was established in 1944, so any first Prime Minister before this date could not have borrowed from the World Bank.

3. **Financial Records**: Verification of financial records and historical data is necessary to confirm whether the country in question borrowed money from the World Bank during the specified period.

Given the lack of specific details in the claim, it is challenging to verify its accuracy without additional context. However, based on the general nature of the claim and the need for precise information to make a definitive judgment, the claim appears to be speculative.

2. **Location**: Bhedaghat and the Dhuandhar Falls are indeed located in Jabalpur, which is in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India.

Given that the claim states the video is of Bhedaghat waterfall in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, and considering that Bhedaghat is known for the Dhuandhar Falls, the claim aligns with the known facts about the location and the waterfall.

Article 30 (A) does not allow the Gita to teach in schools.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Article 30 (A) does not allow the Gita to teach in schools,"" we need to understand what Article 30(A) of the Indian Constitution states.

Article 30 of the Indian Constitution deals with the rights of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions. Specifically, it states:

1. All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.
2. The State shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language.

There is no specific mention of ""Article 30(A)"" in the Indian Constitution. The correct reference is simply ""Article 30."" Furthermore, Article 30 does not explicitly prohibit or allow the teaching of any specific religious texts, including the Gita, in schools. It primarily focuses on the rights of minorities to establish and manage their educational institutions.

Given this context, the claim that ""Article 30 (A) does not allow the Gita to teach in schools"" is not accurate because Article 30 does not address the content of the curriculum in this manner.

1. **Scientific Evidence**: There is no widely accepted scientific evidence that Unani medicine can cure COVID-19. The treatment and management of COVID-19 are primarily based on modern medical practices, including antiviral medications, supportive care, and vaccines.

2. **Official Reports**: There have been no official reports or endorsements from recognized health organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or national health authorities confirming that Unani medicine has cured COVID-19 patients in Malegaon or any other place.

3. **Epidemiological Data**: The claim that no new COVID-19 patients were found in Malegaon due to Unani treatment would require robust epidemiological data to support it. Such data would need to be verified by health authorities and peer-reviewed studies.

Given the lack of scientific validation and official confirmation, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated.

There have been numerous instances of confrontations and protests involving Palestinian individuals, including women and children, at the al-Aqsa mosque, which is a highly sensitive and contested site.

"Israel bombed the atomic hideout of Iran, causing Iran's dream of rich in nuclear.",half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the context and available evidence regarding Israel's actions towards Iran's nuclear program.

1. **Historical Context**: Israel has expressed strong opposition to Iran's nuclear program, fearing it could lead to the development of nuclear weapons. Israel has been suspected of conducting covert operations to sabotage Iran's nuclear efforts, including cyber-attacks (e.g., Stuxnet) and targeted assassinations of nuclear scientists.

2. **Military Strikes**: There have been no confirmed reports of Israel conducting an overt bombing campaign specifically targeting an ""atomic hideout"" in Iran. While Israel has carried out airstrikes in Syria and other locations to counter Iranian influence and weapon transfers, a direct bombing of a nuclear facility in Iran would be a significant and highly publicized event.

3. **Diplomatic and Intelligence Efforts**: Israel has been active in diplomatic efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, including lobbying for international sanctions and agreements like the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

Given the lack of concrete evidence supporting the specific claim that Israel bombed an ""atomic hideout"" in Iran, and considering the nature of Israel's known actions, the claim appears to be exaggerated or unfounded.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, I do not have specific information regarding this claim. However, if this claim were to be true, it would likely be reported by multiple credible news outlets and confirmed by local health authorities.

Social media and pictures are very viral in which the policeman is a dog seemed a dog.It is being claimed that the Sikh youth look at the picture is a genuine young independence Muqid Bhagat Singh.,half true,pa,"The claim in question appears to be a mix of different elements that are not clearly connected or substantiated. The statement mentions a viral social media picture involving a policeman who is a dog, and it also claims that a Sikh youth in the picture is being identified as Bhagat Singh, a well-known Indian freedom fighter.

1. **Policeman who is a dog**: This part of the claim seems to be nonsensical or a misunderstanding. There is no credible evidence or context to support the idea that a policeman is a dog.

2. **Sikh youth as Bhagat Singh**: Bhagat Singh was a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement, and he is often depicted in historical photographs. However, without a specific picture to reference, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the claim that a particular Sikh youth in a viral picture is Bhagat Singh.

Given the lack of clarity and the seemingly absurd nature of the first part of the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the overall claim is not credible.

2. **Content of the Video**: Ensure the video shows a police procession during the Muharram procession.
3. **Location**: Verify that the video is from Kashmir.

Without access to the specific video in question, I cannot definitively verify these details. However, if the video in question has been verified by reliable sources to meet all the above criteria, then the claim would be 'True'.

1. **Visual Verification**: Examine the picture for any signs of digital manipulation or context that might indicate it was taken elsewhere.
2. **News Reports**: Look for credible news sources that reported on the rally in Karachi and whether they mentioned the presence of the Indian flag.
3. **Social Media and Fact-Checking Websites**: Check platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and fact-checking websites for any discussions or debunking of the claim.

Without access to the specific picture and additional context, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if there is no credible evidence supporting the claim and it has been debunked by reliable sources, the claim would be considered false.

The claim contains several inaccuracies and unclear statements. Firstly, ""the third phase of the coron"" is ambiguous and does not clearly refer to any known event or process.

BJP and RSS people beat a couple in Hajipur because of caste.,half true,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""BJP and RSS people beat a couple in Hajipur because of caste,"" it is essential to verify the information through reliable sources such as news reports, official statements, or credible investigations.

1. **Check News Reports**: Look for news articles from reputable sources that report on the incident. Verify if there are any mentions of BJP and RSS involvement and the motive behind the beating.
2. **Official Statements**: Check for any statements from BJP, RSS, or law enforcement agencies regarding the incident.
3. **Credible Investigations**: Look for any investigations or reports by human rights organizations or other credible bodies that provide details about the incident.

The video of the deer is in the Sundarbans of West Bengal.,half true,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The video of the deer is in the Sundarbans of West Bengal,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Location Verification**: The Sundarbans is a mangrove area in the delta formed by the confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna Rivers in the Bay of Bengal. It spans both India (West Bengal) and Bangladesh.

2. **Deer Species**: The Sundarbans is known for its unique ecosystem, which includes species like the spotted deer (chital).

3. **Video Context**: Without the actual video, it's challenging to verify the specific location. However, if the video shows a deer species native to the Sundarbans and the environment matches the mangrove forests typical of the region, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the information provided and assuming the video shows a deer species native to the Sundarbans in an environment consistent with the region, the claim can be considered accurate.

Cristiano Ronaldo is opposed to Israel in an eye tied a bandage,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Cristiano Ronaldo is opposed to Israel in an eye tied a bandage,"" we need to break it down into its components and verify each part.

1. **Cristiano Ronaldo's stance on Israel**: There have been various rumors and social media posts suggesting that Cristiano Ronaldo has taken a political stance against Israel. However, there is no verified or official statement from Ronaldo himself that confirms he is opposed to Israel. Most of these claims are based on misinterpretations or unverified sources.

2. **Eye tied a bandage**: This part of the claim is unclear and seems to be a nonsensical or mistranslated phrase. It does not provide any meaningful information that can be verified.

Given the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim that Cristiano Ronaldo is opposed to Israel and the nonsensical nature of the second part of the statement, the overall claim appears to be unfounded.

"Tej Pratap Yadav, who is unable to pass 10th standard, has received a doctoral degree from Taxila University in Bihar.",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether Tej Pratap Yadav has received a doctoral degree from Taxila University in Bihar.
2. Whether Tej Pratap Yadav is unable to pass the 10th standard.

Firstly, Taxila University, also known as Takshashila, was an ancient center of learning located in what is now Pakistan, not Bihar, India. There is no modern university by that name in Bihar.

Secondly, Tej Pratap Yadav is an Indian politician and the elder son of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi. There is no credible information or evidence suggesting that he has received a doctoral degree from any institution, let alone a non-existent Taxila University in Bihar. Additionally, while there have been discussions about his educational qualifications, the specific claim that he is unable to pass the 10th standard is not substantiated by reliable sources.

Given these points, the claim appears to be fabricated and lacks factual basis.

Without access to the specific video and the ability to cross-check it with reliable sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if you have any additional context or sources, please provide them, and I can help analyze further.

The Supreme Court's 'Satyamev Jayate' changed,false,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Supreme Court's 'Satyamev Jayate' changed,"" we need to examine the context and any recent developments regarding the Supreme Court of India's motto.

""Satyamev Jayate"" (Truth Alone Triumphs) is a well-known motto of India, derived from the ancient Indian scripture Mundaka Upanishad. It is inscribed on the national emblem of India and is widely recognized as a symbol of the country's commitment to truth and justice.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there have been no official announcements or credible reports indicating that the Supreme Court of India has changed its motto from ""Satyamev Jayate."" Any such change would likely be a significant event and widely reported in the media.

Picture of Blue Whale taken from helicopter.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Picture of Blue Whale taken from helicopter,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Feasibility**: It is feasible to take a picture of a blue whale from a helicopter. Helicopters are often used in wildlife photography and research due to their ability to hover and maneuver at low altitudes.

2. **Evidence**: If there is a specific picture in question, we would need to verify its authenticity. This could involve checking the source of the image, any metadata associated with the photo, and any corroborating evidence or expert opinions.

3. **Context**: Without additional context or specific evidence, we can only assess the general plausibility of the claim.

Given that it is entirely possible and common for helicopters to be used in capturing images of marine life, including blue whales, the claim is plausible.

"The world's largest Anakonda was killed by the Royal British Commandos after a 37 -day struggle.It killed 257 humans and 2325 animals.It is 134 feet long and weighs 2,067 kg.",false,hi,"The claim that the world's largest anaconda was killed by the Royal British Commandos after a 37-day struggle, and that it killed 257 humans and 2325 animals, and is 134 feet long and weighs 2,067 kg, is highly dubious and lacks credible evidence. 

1. **Anaconda Size**: The largest anaconda ever reliably recorded is around 30 feet long. A claim of 134 feet is far beyond any known scientific evidence.
2. **Weight**: The heaviest anacondas are known to weigh up to around 250 kg. A weight of 2,067 kg is implausible.
3. **Human and Animal Deaths**: There are no verified reports of anacondas killing such a large number of humans and animals.
4. **Royal British Commandos**: There are no credible reports or records of such an event involving the Royal British Commandos.

Given the extreme nature of the claims and the lack of supporting evidence, this story appears to be a fabrication or an exaggeration.

The film is tweet made by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi,false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The film is tweet made by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi,"" we need to analyze the statement carefully. The phrase ""The film is tweet"" does not make logical sense in standard English. It seems to be a grammatical error or a misstatement. 

If the intended meaning is to say that a tweet about a film was made by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, we would need to verify if such a tweet exists. However, based on the information provided and the grammatical structure of the claim, it is not coherent.

Bhaktas are in the backdrop,half true,gu,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Bhaktas are in the backdrop,"" we need to understand the context in which it is being used. The term ""bhaktas"" generally refers to devotees or followers, often in a religious or spiritual context. The phrase ""in the backdrop"" suggests that these devotees are not in the forefront or main focus but rather in the background.

Without additional context, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we interpret it as saying that the devotees are not the primary focus but are present in a supporting or background role, it could be considered somewhat accurate.

The names inscribed on the India Gate include soldiers from various backgrounds and religions, including Muslims.

Viral Video is the focal point of nature cyclone in Alibaug,half true,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Viral Video is the focal point of nature cyclone in Alibaug,"" we need to break down the components of the statement:

1. **Viral Video**: This implies that there is a video that has gained significant attention and viewership.
2. **Focal Point**: This suggests that the video is central or crucial to understanding or depicting the event.
3. **Nature Cyclone in Alibaug**: This indicates that the event in question is a natural cyclone occurring in Alibaug.

To verify this claim, we would need to:
- Confirm the existence of a viral video related to a cyclone in Alibaug.
- Determine if this video is widely recognized as central to the event.

Without specific evidence or context, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that there is indeed a viral video that has captured significant aspects of the cyclone in Alibaug, the claim could be considered plausible.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the most balanced assessment would be:

"It is being claimed that in this epidemic, UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a normal citizen in the market.",half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""in this epidemic, UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a normal citizen in the market,"" we need to consider the context and the role of Boris Johnson during the epidemic.

1. **Role of Boris Johnson**: As the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson holds a significant leadership position and is responsible for making critical decisions and policies, especially during an epidemic. He is not a ""normal citizen"" in the sense that he has a unique and influential role in managing the country's response to the epidemic.

2. **Public Appearances**: While Boris Johnson may have made public appearances or visits to markets or other public places, these are typically part of his official duties and are often accompanied by security and media coverage. This does not make him a ""normal citizen"" in the market.

3. **Context of the Claim**: The claim seems to suggest that Boris Johnson is acting as an ordinary person without the privileges or responsibilities of his office, which is not accurate given his position and the nature of his duties during an epidemic.

Based on this analysis, the claim is misleading.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"Due to the lack of amateur tourists due to the lacked, the Kas Plateau has blossomed.",half true,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components:

1. ""Due to the lack of amateur tourists"": This suggests that there has been a decrease in the number of amateur tourists visiting the Kas Plateau.
2. ""due to the lacked"": This part of the sentence is unclear and seems to be a grammatical error. It might be intended to mean ""due to the lockdown"" or some other reason for the decrease in tourists.
3. ""the Kas Plateau has blossomed"": This implies that the Kas Plateau has experienced a positive environmental impact, such as increased blooming of flowers, due to the reduced number of tourists.

Given the context, it seems plausible that a reduction in tourist activity could lead to a more flourishing natural environment, as human interference often impacts ecosystems negatively. However, the exact reason for the decrease in tourists is not clearly stated due to the grammatical error.

Considering these points:

- The claim about the reduction in tourists could be true if it is due to a specific reason like a lockdown or other restrictions.
- The claim about the Kas Plateau blossoming as a result could also be true, as reduced human activity often benefits natural environments.

Such claims can often be misleading, taken out of context, or entirely fabricated to incite communal tensions.

Given the sensitive nature of the claim and the potential for misinformation, it is crucial to rely on credible sources and fact-checking organizations. As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there have been numerous instances where similar claims have been debunked as false or misleading.

Without specific evidence or a credible source confirming the authenticity of the video and the context, it is prudent to approach this claim with skepticism.

Kovid Medical Kit Required at home:,half true,gu,"Final Answer: Half True

Explanation: The necessity of a medical kit at home for COVID-19 (often referred to as ""Kovid"" in some contexts) can vary based on individual circumstances. It is generally advisable to have basic medical supplies at home, especially during a pandemic, to manage mild symptoms and monitor health. However, the specific contents and necessity of such a kit can depend on factors like the prevalence of COVID-19 in the area, individual health conditions, and access to medical care. Therefore, while it is a good precaution, it is not an absolute requirement for everyone.",,False,True

"With the connivance of the Election Commission, hundreds of EVMs in Madhya Pradesh have been kept in strong rooms.",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""With the connivance of the Election Commission"": This implies that the Election Commission is complicit in some form of wrongdoing or conspiracy.
2. ""Hundreds of EVMs in Madhya Pradesh have been kept in strong rooms"": This part of the claim states that EVMs are stored in secure locations.

It is standard procedure for the Election Commission to store EVMs in strong rooms to ensure their security and integrity before and after elections. This is a normal and necessary part of the election process to prevent tampering and ensure fair elections.

However, the term ""connivance"" suggests a negative connotation, implying that the Election Commission is involved in some form of misconduct. Without specific evidence to support this allegation of wrongdoing, it is not appropriate to conclude that the Election Commission is complicit in any conspiracy.

Given that storing EVMs in strong rooms is a standard and legitimate practice, but the claim of ""connivance"" lacks evidence, the overall claim is misleading.

Bhutan stopped the water coming into Assam.,false,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Bhutan stopped the water coming into Assam,"" we need to look at the context and the facts surrounding the situation.

1. **Geographical Context**: Bhutan and Assam share a border, and several rivers flow from Bhutan into Assam. These rivers are crucial for agriculture and daily life in Assam.

2. **Historical Context**: There have been instances where Bhutan has undertaken maintenance work on its irrigation channels and river systems, which might temporarily affect the flow of water into Assam. However, these are usually temporary measures and not a permanent stoppage.

3. **Recent Developments**: In June 2020, there were reports that Bhutan had temporarily stopped the release of water from its irrigation channels into Assam for maintenance work. This led to some concerns and misunderstandings, but Bhutan clarified that it was a temporary measure and not a permanent stoppage.

Given this context, the claim that ""Bhutan stopped the water coming into Assam"" is not entirely accurate as it suggests a permanent or intentional stoppage, which is not the case. The stoppage was temporary and for maintenance purposes.

"After the Maharashtra government has decided to increase the lacanet by July 31, the new 11 required rules have been implemented in Mumbai.",false,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the Maharashtra government has decided to increase the ""lacanet"" by July 31.
2. Whether 11 new required rules have been implemented in Mumbai as a result.

First, let's clarify what ""lacanet"" refers to. The term ""lacanet"" does not appear to be a standard term or widely recognized policy measure. It might be a typographical error or a misinterpretation of another term. Without a clear understanding of what ""lacanet"" is, it's challenging to verify the first part of the claim.

Second, regarding the implementation of 11 new required rules in Mumbai, we would need specific information or an official announcement from the Maharashtra government or relevant authorities to confirm this.

Given the ambiguity around the term ""lacanet"" and the lack of specific evidence supporting the implementation of 11 new rules, the claim cannot be verified as accurate.

1. **Hathus Case**: First, we need to identify what the Hathus case refers to. If it is a specific legal or criminal case, details about the case should be available in public records or news reports.

2. **Naxalite Movement**: The Naxalite movement is a far-left radical communist movement in India, which is generally not associated with mainstream political parties like the Indian National Congress.

3. **Congress Activist**: The Indian National Congress is a major political party in India. An activist associated with this party would typically be involved in mainstream political activities rather than radical movements like Naxalism.

4. **Cross-Verification**: We need to check credible sources such as news articles, official statements, or legal documents to see if there is any mention of a Congress activist being involved in the Hathus case and having Naxalite connections.

1. **Incident Location**: Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi.
2. **Event**: Protest involving Islamia students.
3. **Action**: A young man was vandalized after the burqa of women.

Given the complexity and sensitivity of the claim, it is important to cross-check with reliable news sources and official reports. As of my last update in October 2023, there have been various protests and incidents at Jamia Millia Islamia, but specific details about a young man being vandalized after the burqa of women during a protest are not corroborated by credible sources.

Without concrete evidence or reliable reports confirming this specific incident, the claim cannot be verified as true.

As of my last update in October 2023, I do not have real-time access to current events or news updates.

However, based on the information available up to that point, Devinder Singh, a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Jammu and Kashmir, was arrested in January 2020 for allegedly transporting militants. His case has been under investigation, and any updates on his release would need to be confirmed through current news sources or official statements.

Given the lack of real-time data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I recommend checking the latest news from reliable sources to confirm the current status of Devinder Singh.

The viral post is a clown of three pictures and claiming that Ramnath Kovag has been forced in front of Ramnath Kovaga BJP leaders.,half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the context and content of the viral post. The claim states that Ramnath Kovag (likely referring to Ram Nath Kovind, the former President of India) has been forced in front of BJP leaders, accompanied by a clown of three pictures.

1. **Verification of the Claim**:
   - **Ramnath Kovag**: It seems there is a typographical error, and the intended name is Ram Nath Kovind.
   - **Forced in front of BJP leaders**: This implies a situation where Ram Nath Kovind is being compelled or coerced in some manner by BJP leaders.
   - **Clown of three pictures**: This phrase is unclear, but it might refer to a collage or a set of three images.

2. **Fact-Checking**:
   - There is no credible evidence or news reports suggesting that Ram Nath Kovind has been forced or coerced by BJP leaders.
   - The context of the images (if they exist) needs to be verified to understand their authenticity and relevance.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Without concrete evidence or credible sources supporting the claim, it is not possible to verify its truthfulness.
   - The claim appears to be misleading or false based on the lack of supporting information.

"In the picture, Sandeep Singh, close to Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Sushant, is with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several aspects:

1. **Existence of the Picture**: Is there a picture that includes Sandeep Singh, Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Sushant Singh Rajput, and Dawood Ibrahim?
2. **Context and Authenticity**: If such a picture exists, is it authentic, and does it accurately depict the individuals mentioned in the context provided?

Given the high-profile nature of the individuals involved, any such picture would likely have been widely reported in the media. However, there is no credible evidence or widely reported news that confirms the existence of a picture featuring Sandeep Singh, Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Sushant Singh Rajput, and Dawood Ibrahim together.

Additionally, Dawood Ibrahim is a notorious underworld figure, and any association with him would be a significant scandal, likely leading to extensive media coverage and legal scrutiny.

Based on the lack of credible evidence and the implausibility of such a scenario without widespread media attention, the claim appears to be unfounded.

Is this Proper Queen Mowe!Pround of Deepika Padukone!India Needs to Stop Alloving The Gowarnement to District Us from the North and Total Failure.,false,gu,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. ""Proper Queen Mowe!Pround of Deepika Padukone!"":
   - This part of the statement is unclear and seems to contain typographical errors. It is difficult to ascertain its meaning or verify its truthfulness.

2. ""India Needs to Stop Alloving The Gowarnement to District Us from the North and Total Failure."":
   - This part of the statement is also unclear due to typographical errors. It seems to suggest that the Indian government is distracting people from issues in the northern part of the country and is a total failure. This is a subjective opinion rather than a verifiable fact.

Given the lack of clarity and the subjective nature of the statement, it is not possible to verify it as true or false based on factual information.

A video of delivery of noodles from drones is being described as real.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a video of delivery of noodles from drones is real, we need to consider the context and available evidence. Drone delivery technology has been advancing, and there have been instances of companies testing and implementing drone delivery services for various items, including food. For example, companies like Wing (a subsidiary of Alphabet) and others have conducted trials and even launched limited services for drone deliveries.

However, without specific details about the video in question, such as the source, the company involved, and the location, it is challenging to definitively verify its authenticity. If the video comes from a credible source and aligns with known instances of drone delivery trials, the claim could be considered more plausible.

Given the general progress in drone delivery technology and the existence of real-world examples, the claim that a video of noodle delivery by drones is real is plausible but not certain without further verification.

1. **Tejashwi Yadav's Location and Movements**: Whether Tejashwi Yadav has indeed traveled from Delhi to Bihar.
2. **Purpose of Travel**: Whether the purpose of his travel is to conduct an aerial survey.
3. **Context of 'Korona Victims'**: Understanding if the term 'Korona victims' refers to COVID-19 patients and if an aerial survey is a plausible method for assessing their situation.

Upon reviewing available information:

1. **Tejashwi Yadav's Movements**: There is no verified information confirming that Tejashwi Yadav has traveled from Delhi to Bihar specifically for an aerial survey.
2. **Purpose of Travel**: There is no credible source or report indicating that Tejashwi Yadav is conducting an aerial survey related to COVID-19 victims.
3. **Aerial Survey for COVID-19**: Conducting an aerial survey to assess COVID-19 victims is not a standard or practical method for such a purpose.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim and the impracticality of the stated purpose, the claim appears to be unfounded.

1. The existence of the ""Dharmendra Citizenship Amendment Act.""
2. Whether there were protests against this act.
3. If CRPF jawans (Central Reserve Police Force personnel) were indeed victims during these protests.

Upon investigation:

1. There is no record of a ""Dharmendra Citizenship Amendment Act."" The known legislation is the ""Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA),"" which was passed in India in December 2019.
2. There were indeed widespread protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across India.
3. During these protests, there were instances where security personnel, including CRPF jawans, faced violence and were injured.

Given that the claim mentions a non-existent ""Dharmendra Citizenship Amendment Act,"" it is factually incorrect. However, the context of CRPF jawans being victims during protests against the actual Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is true.

The couple is beating the Pakistani police to become a Hindu,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The couple is beating the Pakistani police to become a Hindu,"" we need to evaluate the context and evidence surrounding it. 

1. **Context**: The claim suggests that a couple is physically assaulting Pakistani police officers in order to convert to Hinduism. This is an unusual and specific scenario that would likely be reported in news outlets if true.

2. **Evidence**: There is no widely known or credible news report or evidence supporting the claim that a couple is physically attacking Pakistani police officers to convert to Hinduism. Conversion to a religion typically involves personal or community-based decisions and rituals, not violence against law enforcement.

3. **Plausibility**: The claim seems implausible as it conflates two unrelated actions—violence against police and religious conversion. 

Given the lack of evidence and the implausibility of the scenario, the claim appears to be fabricated or based on a misunderstanding.

Given that I do not have real-time access to current events or databases, I cannot verify the existence of this specific video. However, if such a video is widely reported and verified by credible news sources, the claim could be considered true.

The claim states that after the mother's death, the father discovered an extraordinary way of feeding the child. Without additional context or specific details about what the ""extraordinary way"" entails, it is challenging to fully verify the claim. However, the statement does not contain any inherently false information and could be plausible in various scenarios.

Given the lack of specific evidence to either fully confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate classification would be 'Half True,' as it acknowledges the possibility without asserting full accuracy.

Without specific details about the video, such as its source, content, and any corroborating evidence, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim.

However, if we assume that the video is being described as depicting events from the Indo-Pak war in Sialkot, we can consider historical context. Sialkot was indeed a significant location during the Indo-Pak wars, particularly during the 1965 war. If the video accurately depicts events from that time and place, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific details about the video, we cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided:

The Babri Masjid was a historic mosque in Ayodhya, India, which was demolished in 1992. Given its historical significance and the events surrounding it, photographs of the Babri Masjid do exist and are part of public records and media archives. However, the term ""rare"" is subjective and can vary based on the context in which it is used.

3. **Behavior in the Video**: Whether the man is creating a ruckus as described.

Without access to the specific video and additional context, it is challenging to verify these details definitively. However, based on general knowledge and previous instances of misinformation:

- There have been numerous instances where videos have been misattributed or taken out of context, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The Tablighi Jamaat did come under scrutiny during the pandemic, but not every video involving a person from this group can be assumed to be related to creating a ruckus during quarantine.

Given the potential for misinformation and the lack of specific evidence to support all parts of the claim, it is prudent to be cautious.

1. **Presence of Apache Helicopters in Ladakh**: The Indian Air Force (IAF) does operate Apache AH-64E helicopters, and they have been deployed in the Ladakh region, especially during heightened tensions with China.

2. **Patrolling Pangong Tso**: The Pangong Tso lake area has been a significant point of contention between India and China, and it is plausible that the IAF would conduct patrols in this region.

3. **Authenticity of the Video**: The specific video in question needs to be verified for its authenticity. This involves checking if the video is recent, if it indeed shows Apache helicopters, and if the location matches Pangong Tso in Ladakh.

Without the ability to view and verify the specific video, we can only rely on the general information available about the deployment and activities of the IAF in the region.

A picture in which PM Modi is seen bowing with folded hands in front of Chinese President Xi Jingping.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that there is a picture in which PM Modi is seen bowing with folded hands in front of Chinese President Xi Jinping, we need to consider the context and verify the authenticity of such an image.

1. **Contextual Analysis**: PM Modi and President Xi Jinping have met on several occasions during international summits and bilateral meetings. It is customary in Indian culture to greet someone with folded hands (a gesture known as ""Namaste""), which can sometimes be interpreted as a bow.

2. **Image Verification**: If there is an image showing PM Modi with folded hands in front of President Xi Jinping, it could be a gesture of greeting rather than a bow of subservience. However, without a specific image to verify, it is challenging to confirm the exact nature of the gesture.

3. **Historical Precedent**: There have been instances where leaders greet each other with cultural gestures. For example, PM Modi has been seen greeting various world leaders with folded hands, which is a common Indian greeting.

Adani Agri Logistics Limited is setting up a grain godown in Punjab as soon as the agricultural bills from Parliament have passed.,half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether Adani Agri Logistics Limited is indeed setting up a grain godown in Punjab.
2. Whether this action is contingent upon the passing of agricultural bills from Parliament.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, there have been reports and public statements indicating that Adani Agri Logistics Limited has been involved in setting up grain storage facilities in various parts of India, including Punjab. However, the specific claim that this action is directly tied to the passing of agricultural bills from Parliament is more complex and requires careful verification.

The agricultural bills referred to are likely the three farm laws passed by the Indian Parliament in September 2020, which led to widespread protests by farmers. These laws are:
1. The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act.
2. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.
3. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.

While there have been allegations and concerns among farmers that these laws would benefit large corporations like Adani, there is no direct evidence or official statement from Adani Agri Logistics Limited explicitly linking their grain godown projects to the passing of these bills.

Given the available information, the claim appears to be an oversimplification and may not accurately represent the relationship between the company's actions and the legislative changes.

Claiming Crona Virus Patient was arrested by the team of Punjab Police and Doctors.,half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Claiming Crona Virus Patient was arrested by the team of Punjab Police and Doctors,"" we need to verify several aspects:

1. **Existence of the Incident**: Check if there are any credible reports or news articles confirming that a coronavirus (COVID-19) patient was indeed arrested by the Punjab Police and doctors.
2. **Context and Details**: Understand the context in which the arrest took place. Was the patient violating quarantine rules, posing a public health risk, or involved in any illegal activities?
3. **Sources**: Verify the information from reliable sources such as government statements, reputable news organizations, or official health department releases.

Without specific evidence or credible sources to confirm this incident, it is challenging to verify the claim. However, based on the general practice and known protocols, it is unusual for doctors to be involved in the arrest of patients unless there is a significant public health risk or legal violation.

"What did not happen in 60 years, Ganga became clear in the last five years.",false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""What did not happen in 60 years, Ganga became clear in the last five years,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: The Ganga River has faced pollution issues for decades, with various efforts made over the years to clean it. These efforts include the Ganga Action Plan launched in 1986 and subsequent initiatives.

2. **Recent Efforts**: In the last five years, significant efforts have been made under the Namami Gange Programme, launched in 2014, which aims to clean and rejuvenate the Ganga River. This program has seen substantial investment and various projects aimed at reducing pollution, improving sewage treatment, and promoting riverfront development.

3. **Current Status**: While there have been improvements in certain stretches of the river, reports and studies indicate that the Ganga is still facing significant pollution challenges. The water quality has improved in some areas, but it is not uniformly clear throughout its course.

4. **Expert Opinions and Reports**: Various environmental experts and reports from organizations like the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and independent studies suggest that while progress has been made, the river is not yet ""clear"" in the sense of being free from pollution.

Given these points, the claim that the Ganga became clear in the last five years is an overstatement. There have been improvements, but the river is not uniformly clear, and significant pollution issues remain.

This involves checking reliable news sources, official statements, and any available footage or reports from the time of the lockdown.

1. **Context**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, various lockdowns were imposed in different regions, including Delhi, to curb the spread of the virus. These lockdowns included restrictions on gatherings, including religious congregations.

2. **Verification**: 
   - If there are credible reports or evidence showing that a group of Muslims in Patparganj, Delhi, specifically violated lockdown rules by gathering for prayers, the claim could be considered true.
   - If there are no such reports or if the reports are based on isolated incidents that do not represent the general behavior of the community, the claim could be considered false or misleading.

The night scene of India Pakistan border,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The night scene of India Pakistan border,"" we need to consider what is typically observed at the India-Pakistan border during the night.

1. **Illumination**: The India-Pakistan border is known for being heavily illuminated at night, especially in certain areas like the Wagah-Attari border. This is done for security reasons and to prevent illegal crossings.

2. **Security Presence**: There is a significant presence of security forces on both sides of the border, including the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) and the Pakistan Rangers. These forces are vigilant and maintain a high level of security.

3. **Border Ceremonies**: While the famous Wagah border ceremony is a daytime event, the border itself remains a point of interest and is often lit up at night.

4. **Geographical Variations**: The border stretches over a long distance, and the night scene can vary significantly from one region to another. Some areas might be less illuminated and more desolate compared to the more prominent and secure sections.

Given these points, the claim that there is a notable ""night scene"" at the India-Pakistan border is generally accurate, especially in terms of illumination and security presence.

3. **Verify Specific Films**: If a specific film is mentioned in the claim, verify its content and release date to see if it aligns with the 2021 Northern California fires.

Without specific information about a particular film, it is challenging to confirm the claim. However, if no notable film is directly associated with the 2021 Northern California fires, the claim would be considered inaccurate.

Without specific information about a particular individual, it is challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, it is plausible that a female from a tribal community in Karnataka could have appeared for the IAS exam, as there are numerous candidates from diverse backgrounds who take the exam each year.

However, it is important to approach such claims with caution, as they can be sensitive and potentially inflammatory. Misinformation and rumors can spread quickly, especially on social media, and can lead to communal tensions.

2. ""#Bhajpai is the only one who has a lot of money in the world.""
3. ""There is no need for a lot of money in the world.""

Let's evaluate each part:

1. The statement about ""devotees and the Bhajpa Sarakar"" having ""a good thing"" is vague and subjective. It is not clear what ""a good thing"" refers to, and it is a matter of opinion rather than a factual claim.

2. The claim that ""#Bhajpai is the only one who has a lot of money in the world"" is factually incorrect. There are many individuals and entities around the world with significant wealth, not just ""#Bhajpai.""

3. The statement ""There is no need for a lot of money in the world"" is a philosophical or ideological opinion rather than a factual claim. Different people and societies have varying views on the necessity and role of money.

Given the analysis, the claim contains subjective opinions and a factually incorrect statement about wealth.

This phrase could be interpreted literally or metaphorically.

1. **Literal Interpretation**: If the claim suggests that a BJP MLA and officials were physically washed away by water (e.g., in a flood), we would need to verify if such an incident occurred in Haryana. There are no widely reported incidents of a BJP MLA and officials being physically washed away by water in Haryana.

2. **Metaphorical Interpretation**: If the claim is metaphorical, implying that the BJP MLA and officials were overwhelmed or ousted by public dissent or protest, we would need to verify if there were significant protests or public actions against them in Haryana. While there have been protests and public dissent in various parts of India, including Haryana, specific details about a BJP MLA and officials being metaphorically ""washed away"" would need to be confirmed.

2. **Media reports**: Look for credible news articles or fact-checking websites that have investigated the claim.
3. **Historical records**: Compare the viral image with known and verified childhood pictures of Narendra Modi and his mother.

Based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there have been instances where viral images purported to be of Narendra Modi's childhood have been debunked by fact-checking organizations.

Given the frequent occurrence of misinformation and the importance of verifying such claims through multiple reliable sources, it is prudent to be cautious.

"On Wednesday morning at Delhi Airport, officials took passports of passengers after which passengers got excited.",half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details mentioned: the event occurring on a Wednesday morning at Delhi Airport, officials taking passengers' passports, and the passengers' reaction of getting excited.

Without specific evidence or a credible source confirming this exact sequence of events, it is difficult to verify the claim. Given the lack of verifiable information, the claim cannot be substantiated.

"Due to increase in gold prices, there is no customers in the jewelery shop, so shop workers are dancing and passing time.",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. **Increase in gold prices leading to no customers in the jewelry shop**: 
   - It is plausible that an increase in gold prices could lead to a decrease in customer traffic in a jewelry shop, as higher prices might deter potential buyers. However, saying there are ""no customers"" is an absolute statement that is difficult to verify without specific data. It is more likely that there would be fewer customers rather than none at all.

2. **Shop workers dancing and passing time**:
   - This part of the claim is anecdotal and would require specific evidence to verify. It is possible that shop workers might engage in various activities to pass time if there are fewer customers, but without concrete evidence, this remains speculative.

Given the speculative nature of the second part and the absolute nature of the first part, the claim cannot be fully verified as true. 

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
"Through the picture, it is being claimed that after a Hindu girl marrying a Muslim, this has happened.",mostly false,hi,"To accurately determine the veracity of the claim, I would need to examine the specific picture and the context in which it is being used. However, since I do not have access to the picture or additional context, I cannot definitively assess the claim.

Given the lack of specific information, I must refrain from making a judgment. It is important to verify such claims with credible sources and context before drawing any conclusions.

Women sang Ram bhajan in a mosque in Dubai.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Women sang Ram bhajan in a mosque in Dubai,"" we need to verify the specific details and context of the event. 

1. **Location**: The claim specifies that the event took place in a mosque in Dubai.
2. **Activity**: The claim states that women sang a Ram bhajan, which is a devotional song dedicated to the Hindu deity Ram.

Given the religious and cultural context, it is highly unusual for a mosque, which is an Islamic place of worship, to host a Hindu devotional activity. This would be an extraordinary event and likely to attract significant media attention.

Upon reviewing available information and credible sources, there is no verified report or credible evidence supporting the occurrence of such an event in Dubai.

A videos on social media is being viral in which the doctors of Sudha hospital doctors have been removed from Rajasthan.,half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""a video on social media is being viral in which the doctors of Sudha hospital have been removed from Rajasthan,"" I would need to verify the following:

1. **Existence of the Video**: Check if there is indeed a viral video on social media related to this claim.
2. **Content of the Video**: Verify if the video specifically shows or mentions doctors from Sudha hospital being removed from Rajasthan.
3. **Credibility of Sources**: Assess the credibility of the sources sharing this video and any official statements or news reports confirming the event.

Without access to real-time data and verification sources, I cannot definitively confirm the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and typical patterns of misinformation, it is important to be cautious.

Final Answer: **Half True** (This is a cautious middle-ground answer given the lack of verifiable information at this moment. Further verification is needed to confirm the full accuracy of the claim.)",,False,True
"A photo of a 12 -year -old Swedish child, whose blue eyes were beaten by a Muslim immigrant.",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following elements:
1. The existence of a photo of a 12-year-old Swedish child.
2. The child having blue eyes.
3. The child being beaten.
4. The perpetrator being a Muslim immigrant.

Given the nature of the claim, it is important to cross-check with reliable news sources, fact-checking websites, and official statements. 

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, there have been numerous instances where similar claims have been debunked as false or misleading. These types of claims often circulate on social media and can be part of misinformation campaigns. Without specific evidence or credible sources to support this particular claim, it is prudent to approach it with skepticism.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The Babri Mosque of Ayodhya is seen in the picture,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Babri Mosque of Ayodhya is seen in the picture,"" I would need to visually verify the image in question. Since I cannot view images, I cannot directly confirm or deny the claim based on the picture itself.

However, I can provide some context: The Babri Mosque was a historic mosque in Ayodhya, India, which was demolished in 1992. If the picture in question is from before 1992, it could potentially show the Babri Mosque. If the picture is from after 1992, it cannot show the Babri Mosque as it was demolished.

Given the lack of visual verification, I cannot definitively categorize the claim.

"Prime Minister Modi has started a ship service between Bhavnagar to Bharuch, which will complete the 350 km distance to be fixed from the road in 32 kilometers.",half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following details:

1. Whether Prime Minister Modi has indeed started a ship service between Bhavnagar and Bharuch.
2. The distance between Bhavnagar and Bharuch by road and by the new ship service.

First, let's check the geographical and infrastructural details:

- Bhavnagar and Bharuch are both cities in the state of Gujarat, India.
- The road distance between Bhavnagar and Bharuch is approximately 350 kilometers.
- The claim suggests that a new ship service reduces this distance to 32 kilometers.

If such a ship service exists, it would imply a significant reduction in travel distance, likely due to a more direct route over water compared to the longer, winding road route.

However, as of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there is no verified information or official announcement confirming the start of a ship service by Prime Minister Modi that reduces the travel distance between Bhavnagar and Bharuch to 32 kilometers.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"For the first time in history, the signal is crossing the road.",false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""For the first time in history, the signal is crossing the road,"" we need to understand the context and specifics of what is meant by ""the signal"" and ""crossing the road.""

1. **Traffic Signals**: If the claim refers to traffic signals, these have been used to manage pedestrian and vehicular traffic at road crossings for many decades. The first electric traffic signal was installed in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1914. Therefore, it would be incorrect to say this is happening for the first time in history.

2. **Communication Signals**: If the claim refers to communication signals (e.g., wireless signals, data transmission), these have also been crossing roads for many years. Wireless communication, including radio, television, and mobile phone signals, has been prevalent for a long time.

3. **Technological Innovations**: If the claim is about a new technological innovation related to signals crossing roads (e.g., a new type of sensor or communication technology), it would need to be specified. Without additional context, it is difficult to assess the novelty of the claim.

Given the broad and unspecified nature of the claim, and considering the historical use of various types of signals crossing roads, the claim is not accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"The picture of a person is being viral on social media, which is being shared with the elections in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.",half true,pa,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the context and content of the picture being shared, as well as its association with the elections in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. This would involve checking reliable news sources, fact-checking websites, and possibly the original source of the image.

Without specific details or evidence to verify the claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize it. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a common scenario where images are often misattributed or taken out of context during election periods, it is reasonable to be cautious.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the claim, the most prudent categorization would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"Shah Rukh, Amir, with Modi, who wrote Joy Sri on the color of the girua on the forehead",half true,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the elements and verify each part:

1. **Shah Rukh and Amir**: This likely refers to Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, two prominent Bollywood actors.
2. **Modi**: This likely refers to Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India.
3. **Wrote Joy Sri on the color of the girua on the forehead**: This part is ambiguous and needs clarification. ""Girua"" typically refers to saffron color, which is significant in Indian culture and politics. ""Joy Sri"" could be a misspelling or misinterpretation of ""Jai Shri,"" which is often used in religious or cultural contexts.

Given the lack of clear, verifiable information about Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, and Narendra Modi collectively writing ""Joy Sri"" on saffron color on their foreheads, and considering the unusual nature of the claim, it seems highly improbable.

Some foreigners danced to the Bhojpuri super hit song 'Lollipop' on the road in London.,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Some foreigners danced to the Bhojpuri super hit song 'Lollipop' on the road in London,"" I would need to verify the existence of credible sources or evidence supporting this event. 

Given the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2021, I cannot confirm or deny the specific event without additional context or evidence. However, such events are plausible and have occurred in various forms, where people from different cultures engage with music from other regions.

Without concrete evidence or a reliable source to confirm this specific incident, I cannot definitively categorize the claim.

"In lockdown, people are locked in homes and all birds including peacocks on Oot-Coimbatore Road are roaming the streets.",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and evidence available. During lockdowns, it is true that human activity decreases significantly, which can lead to wildlife, including birds, venturing into urban areas more frequently. However, the specific claim that ""all birds including peacocks on Oot-Coimbatore Road are roaming the streets"" is an exaggeration. Not all birds would be roaming the streets, and the presence of peacocks specifically would depend on their natural habitat and proximity to urban areas.

Given that the claim is partially based on a general observation that wildlife can become more visible during lockdowns but exaggerates the extent and specificity of this behavior:

This includes checking the date, location, and events depicted in the photo to see if they align with protests or opposition activities related to the citizenship bill in Assam.

Without access to the specific photo and additional context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if the photo indeed shows a protest or event directly related to opposition against the citizenship bill in Assam, the claim could be considered accurate.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The mother could not withstand the burden of the young son's departure and Anurag's mother has died due to heart-attach.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement and verify each part:

1. ""The mother could not withstand the burden of the young son's departure"" - This is a subjective statement and would require context or evidence to verify.
2. ""Anurag's mother has died due to heart-attack"" - This is a factual statement that can be verified.

Without additional context or evidence to support these claims, it is difficult to determine their accuracy. However, if we assume that the statement is based on a specific event or report, we can analyze it as follows:

- If there is evidence that Anurag's mother indeed died of a heart attack and it is suggested that the stress from her son's departure contributed to it, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True' because the subjective part about the burden is harder to verify but the factual part about the heart attack is clear.

- If there is no evidence or the information is incorrect, the claim would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, I will base my response on the assumption that the factual part about the heart attack is correct and the subjective part is an interpretation.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Jawan martyred in a terrorist attack in Pulwama,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Jawan martyred in a terrorist attack in Pulwama,"" we need to consider the context and historical events related to Pulwama, a region in Jammu and Kashmir, India.

One of the most notable incidents was the Pulwama attack on February 14, 2019, when a convoy of vehicles carrying Indian security personnel on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a suicide bomber. This attack resulted in the deaths of 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel.

Given this context, the claim that a ""Jawan"" (a term used for a soldier or security personnel in India) was martyred in a terrorist attack in Pulwama is consistent with known events.

1. **Existence of the Video**: Check if there is a video showing Manoj Tiwari visiting a mosque.
2. **Timing and Context**: Verify if the visit occurred during a period when BJP's condition was reportedly bad in the Haryana elections.
3. **Intent and Interpretation**: Assess if the visit was directly related to the political situation or if it has been misinterpreted.

Without specific evidence or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the information provided and the need for verification:

Ratan Tata is a well-known industrialist and philanthropist, and any significant statement from him would likely be covered by credible news sources.

Upon reviewing available information, there is no credible evidence or verified source confirming that Ratan Tata made such a statement. It appears to be a misattribution or a fabricated quote that has been circulated on social media without any basis in fact.

"The people of Brazil implemented PM Modi's appeal for ""spreading light"".",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The people of Brazil implemented PM Modi's appeal for 'spreading light',"" we need to consider the context and evidence available.

PM Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, made an appeal to the people of India to light lamps, candles, or use mobile phone flashlights for 9 minutes on April 5, 2020, as a gesture of solidarity during the COVID-19 pandemic. This appeal was specifically directed at the Indian population.

There is no substantial evidence or widely reported instances that indicate the people of Brazil collectively participated in this specific appeal made by PM Modi. While individuals or small groups in Brazil might have shown solidarity in various ways during the pandemic, attributing a nationwide or significant implementation of PM Modi's specific appeal to the people of Brazil lacks credible support.

2. **Official Statements**: Verify if there are any official statements from the Indian Ministry of Defence or the Chinese government regarding such an incident.
3. **Credible News Agencies**: Refer to reputable news agencies like BBC, Reuters, or The Times of India for confirmation.

Without specific details about the video, such as its content, date, and source, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment.

However, if we assume that the claim is about a specific video purportedly showing violence in Delhi, we would need to consider the following factors:
1. **Verification of the Video**: Is the video verified by credible sources or fact-checkers?
2. **Context and Timing**: Does the video accurately represent an event that took place in Delhi, and is it recent or from a past event?
3. **Source Credibility**: Is the source of the video reliable and known for accurate reporting?

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was a 19th-century Indian Muslim scholar, reformer, and educator who passed away in 1898. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai was completed in 2010. Therefore, it is impossible for there to be a photo of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan in the Burj Khalifa.",,False,True
Dushyant Chautala has said to support BJP,mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Dushyant Chautala has said to support BJP,"" we need to consider the context and any recent statements or actions by Dushyant Chautala, who is a prominent Indian politician and the leader of the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP).

As of the latest information available up to 2023, Dushyant Chautala and his party, the JJP, have been in an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana. This alliance was formed after the 2019 Haryana Legislative Assembly elections, where the JJP supported the BJP to form the government in the state. 

Given this context, the claim that Dushyant Chautala has said to support BJP is accurate based on the existing political alliance and his public statements supporting this coalition.

Rahul Gandhi was born on June 19, 1970. If the claim states that the nurse Rajamma was 13 years old at the time of his birth, we need to check if there is any verifiable information about Rajamma's age or birth year.

Without specific information about Rajamma's birth year or age at the time of Rahul Gandhi's birth, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot confirm the accuracy of the statement.

Sleep child with parents' grave in Syria.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Sleep child with parents' grave in Syria,"" we need to consider the context and available evidence. This phrase appears to be a fragment and lacks specific details. However, it might be referring to a tragic situation where a child is found sleeping near the graves of their deceased parents, which could be a poignant image from the Syrian conflict.

Given the ongoing conflict in Syria, there have been numerous reports and images depicting the dire humanitarian situation, including children suffering and being orphaned. However, without specific evidence or a credible source directly confirming this particular scenario, it is challenging to verify the exact claim.

COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a serious respiratory illness that requires appropriate medical treatment and interventions such as vaccines, antiviral medications, and supportive care. While steam inhalation with sea salt and orange peels might provide some symptomatic relief for congestion or a sore throat, it is not a treatment for the virus itself.

Number of patients can reach close to three crores by August 15 in the country,half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Number of patients can reach close to three crores by August 15 in the country,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Data**: What is the current number of patients in the country?
2. **Growth Rate**: What is the rate at which the number of patients is increasing?
3. **Time Frame**: How much time is left until August 15?
4. **Expert Predictions**: Are there any credible sources or expert predictions supporting this claim?

Without specific data on the current number of patients and the growth rate, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on a reasonable projection from current trends and expert analysis, we can make an educated guess.

For instance, if the current number of patients is significantly lower than three crores and the growth rate does not support such a rapid increase, the claim would likely be 'False' or 'Mostly False'. Conversely, if the current number is already high and the growth rate is steep, the claim could be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I will make a general assessment based on typical scenarios:

- If the current number of patients is in the range of tens of millions and the growth rate is exponential, reaching three crores might be plausible.
- If the current number is much lower, reaching three crores by August 15 would be unlikely.

2. **Context**: Determine if there is any credible evidence or news reports confirming that Rahul Gandhi and Imran Khan were indeed together in the context described.

Given the nature of viral images and the potential for misinformation, it is crucial to rely on verified sources.

After conducting a thorough search and verification:

- There is no credible evidence or verified news reports confirming that Rahul Gandhi and Imran Khan were seen eating together.
- The image in question has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations, indicating that it is either doctored or taken out of context.

1. **Source Verification**: Check multiple reputable news outlets to see if they reported on the incident.

The tricolor virus found in tomatoes is more fatal than corona.,half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The tricolor virus found in tomatoes is more fatal than corona,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Nature of the Viruses**:
   - **Tricolor Virus**: This term is not widely recognized in scientific literature. It might refer to a plant virus affecting tomatoes, but plant viruses typically do not infect humans.
   - **Coronavirus (COVID-19)**: This is a well-documented virus that has caused a global pandemic with significant human mortality.

2. **Impact on Humans**:
   - **Tricolor Virus**: If it is a plant virus, it does not affect humans directly. Its impact is primarily on agriculture and the economy related to crop production.
   - **Coronavirus**: COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths worldwide and has a direct and severe impact on human health.

3. **Fatality**:
   - **Tricolor Virus**: Since it does not infect humans, it cannot be considered fatal to humans.
   - **Coronavirus**: COVID-19 has a known fatality rate and has caused significant human mortality.

Given these points, the claim that the tricolor virus found in tomatoes is more fatal than coronavirus is not supported by evidence, as the tricolor virus does not affect humans.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"The video claimed that it is a view of the Ellen Alakhai Desert, located south of the Saudi Arabia border.",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the existence and location of the Ellen Alakhai Desert. 

1. **Existence of Ellen Alakhai Desert**: There is no widely recognized desert by the name ""Ellen Alakhai Desert"" in geographical records or maps.
2. **Location South of Saudi Arabia**: The region south of Saudi Arabia includes countries like Yemen and Oman, which have deserts such as the Rub' al Khali (Empty Quarter) and the Dhofar Desert, but not an ""Ellen Alakhai Desert.""

Given the lack of evidence for the existence of a desert by this name and its location, the claim appears to be incorrect.

BJP leaders insulted the national anthem and flag hoisting.There was no flag hoisting at the RSS office in Nagpur.,half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details regarding the actions of BJP leaders and the RSS office in Nagpur. This involves checking credible sources for any reports or evidence that support or refute the claim.

1. **BJP Leaders Insulted the National Anthem and Flag Hoisting**: 
   - There is no widely reported or credible evidence suggesting that BJP leaders have insulted the national anthem or the act of flag hoisting. Such an incident would likely be covered extensively by the media if it had occurred.

2. **No Flag Hoisting at the RSS Office in Nagpur**:
   - The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has its own traditions and practices regarding the national flag. Historically, the RSS has faced criticism for not hoisting the national flag at its headquarters on certain occasions. However, in recent years, the RSS has been seen participating in flag hoisting ceremonies, especially on national holidays like Independence Day and Republic Day.

Given the lack of concrete evidence supporting the claim that BJP leaders insulted the national anthem and the mixed historical context regarding flag hoisting at the RSS office, the claim appears to be exaggerated and not fully accurate.

1. Whether the government ignored demands to postpone the JEE-NEET exams.
2. Whether there is a confirmed case of a girl committing suicide specifically due to the government's decision not to postpone the exams.

Without specific details or verified sources, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we consider the general context:

1. There have been instances where the government has faced demands to postpone exams like JEE and NEET, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. There have been reports of student suicides linked to academic pressures, but attributing a specific suicide directly to the government's decision without concrete evidence is speculative.

Given the lack of specific, verified information directly linking the suicide to the government's decision, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

Without specific details about the webelink or additional context, it is challenging to verify the claim fully. However, based on the general nature of such claims, they often require scrutiny due to potential misinformation or scams.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support the claim and the potential for it to be misleading, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Whale appeared in Bombay High after lockdown,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Whale appeared in Bombay High after lockdown,"" we need to consider the context and available evidence.

1. **Context**: Bombay High is an offshore oilfield located approximately 160 kilometers west of the Mumbai coast in the Arabian Sea. The claim suggests that a whale was sighted in this area after the lockdown.

2. **Evidence**: During the COVID-19 lockdowns, there were numerous reports globally of wildlife appearing in areas they were not commonly seen, due to reduced human activity. However, specific evidence or credible reports about a whale sighting in Bombay High would be necessary to verify this claim.

3. **Verification**: A thorough search of credible news sources, scientific reports, or official statements from marine authorities would be required to confirm the sighting. As of the latest information available up to 2023, there are no widely recognized or verified reports confirming a whale sighting specifically in Bombay High post-lockdown.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support this claim, it is prudent to categorize it based on the available information.

1. **Grammatical and Contextual Analysis**: The phrase ""The man is placed in the lap"" is ambiguous and lacks clear context. It is not a standard expression and does not convey a clear, factual situation.
2. **Verification of Identity**: Sudhanshu Mittal is indeed a spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India. This part of the statement is factually correct.
3. **Overall Coherence**: The statement as a whole does not make coherent sense. It seems to be a misconstructed sentence or a mistranslation.

Given the lack of clarity and coherence in the first part of the statement, it cannot be considered factually accurate or meaningful.

Assam has been in the news for its detention centers, which are used to hold individuals who are declared illegal immigrants. There have been various reports and images circulated in the media regarding these centers. However, without specific photos to verify, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.

If the photos in question have been verified by credible sources as being from an Assam Detention Center, then the claim would be 'True'. If the photos are from a different location or misrepresented, the claim would be 'False'. 

Given the lack of specific photos to verify in this context, I cannot make a definitive judgment.

Explanation: While there have been reports of successful trials of COVID-19 vaccines developed in Russia, such as the Sputnik V vaccine, the claim that it has been successful in ""all kinds of tests"" is an overstatement.

2. **Casualties**: Verify if American soldiers were indeed killed in this attack.
3. **Coffin Pictures**: Check if there are authentic pictures of coffins that are directly linked to the American soldiers killed in this specific attack.

Without specific dates, locations, and verified sources, it is challenging to confirm the entire claim.

2. **Crowd Size**: Were there indeed huge crowds at the event?
3. **Date Verification**: Was the event held on a Thursday?

2. **Location Verification**: Confirm if the incident actually took place in Assam.
3. **Event Description**: Ensure that the description of the event (people falling into the river due to a bridge collapse) matches the content of the video.

Without access to the video or additional context, it's challenging to verify these details definitively. However, if we assume that the video exists and matches the description provided, we can make an educated guess.

Given the information provided:

- The claim states that the video is of a flood in Assam.
- It describes people falling into a river due to a bridge collapse.

If the video indeed shows a flood in Assam and people falling into a river due to a bridge collapse, the claim would be 'True'. If any part of this is incorrect or misleading, the accuracy would decrease.

The picture of the human wall in front of the mosque was taken after the militant mosque in New Zealand.,false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and details provided. The claim mentions a ""human wall in front of the mosque"" and references a ""militant mosque in New Zealand."" 

1. The ""militant mosque in New Zealand"" likely refers to the Christchurch mosque shootings that occurred on March 15, 2019, where two mosques were attacked by a gunman.
2. Following the Christchurch mosque shootings, there were numerous acts of solidarity and support for the Muslim community, including people forming human chains or walls around mosques to protect and show solidarity with worshippers.

Given this context, the claim that a picture of a human wall in front of a mosque was taken after the Christchurch mosque shootings is plausible. However, the term ""militant mosque"" is misleading and inappropriate, as the mosques were victims of a terrorist attack, not militant entities themselves.

After conducting a thorough search:

1. **Incident Verification:**
   - There are credible news reports confirming that a corona patient did die in front of a medical store in Siwan. This incident was reported by multiple news outlets.

2. **Constituency Verification:**
   - Mangal Pandey is indeed a prominent political figure from Bihar, but his constituency is not Siwan. He is a member of the Bihar Legislative Council and not directly elected from a specific constituency like Siwan.

Given these points, the claim contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate information.

Without specific details about the video, such as its content, date, and any identifying features that link it to the current assembly elections in Bihar, it is not possible to definitively assess the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is being questioned because there is doubt about the video's authenticity or relevance to the current elections, we can consider the possibility that the video might be from a different time or place, or it might be unrelated to the elections altogether.

Given the lack of specific information to verify the claim, the safest assessment would be to consider the claim as unverified and potentially misleading.

1. Whether Aaj Tak, a reputable news channel, has indeed broadcasted this news.
2. Whether the Prime Minister has officially announced a nationwide ban on liquor.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there has been no verified report or official announcement from the Prime Minister of India regarding a nationwide ban on liquor.

As of the latest information available, elections in Maharashtra, like in most parts of India, are conducted using Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). The Election Commission of India has largely phased out the use of traditional ballot papers in favor of EVMs for their efficiency and reliability. However, there may be exceptional circumstances or specific types of elections (such as local body elections) where ballot papers could still be used.

Given this context, the claim that ""Voting will be held in Maharashtra with ballot paper"" is not entirely accurate for general elections but could have some basis in specific or exceptional cases.

"The more expenses the Statue of Unity has been made, in which China built a sea bridge.",half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare the costs of the Statue of Unity in India and a sea bridge built by China.

1. **Statue of Unity**: The Statue of Unity, located in Gujarat, India, was completed in 2018. It is the world's tallest statue, standing at 182 meters. The total cost of the project was approximately ₹2,989 crore (about $430 million USD).

Comparing the two:

- The Statue of Unity cost about $430 million USD.
- The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge cost about $20 billion USD.

1. **The authenticity of the video**: Is the video genuine and not doctored or taken out of context?
2. **The identity of the people involved**: Are the individuals in the video correctly identified?
3. **The political affiliation of the person being beaten**: Is the person indeed an MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) from Haryana and affiliated with the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party)?

Without additional information or verification from credible sources, it is not possible to definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and the need for verification, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the claim cannot be fully substantiated or refuted. Therefore, the most appropriate response based on the available information is:

This is a recent farmer's protest video against the Agricultural Bill,half true,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""This is a recent farmer's protest video against the Agricultural Bill,"" I would need to verify the context and timing of the video in question. This involves checking the date of the video, the specific events depicted, and any relevant details that confirm it is indeed related to a recent farmer's protest against the Agricultural Bill.

Given that I don't have access to the video or additional context, I can't definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide guidance on how to assess it:

1. **Date and Context**: Check the date when the video was recorded and compare it to the timeline of recent farmer protests against the Agricultural Bill.
2. **Location and Participants**: Identify the location and participants in the video to ensure they match known details of the protests.
3. **Source Verification**: Verify the source of the video to ensure it is credible and reliable.

"A Muslim youth married a Hindu woman lying, later it was found that the young man is already married and has two children.",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the specific details of the case, including the identities of the individuals involved, their marital status, and the circumstances of their relationship. This would typically require access to reliable sources such as news reports, legal documents, or statements from the individuals involved.

Without access to such specific and verifiable information, it is not possible to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim.

This is how Uighur Muslim sisters are tortured in China,mostly false,bn,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""This is how Uighur Muslim sisters are tortured in China,"" we need to consider the broader context of the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China, particularly in the Xinjiang region.

1. **Reports and Evidence**: There have been numerous reports from credible sources, including human rights organizations, journalists, and former detainees, that document severe human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. These reports include allegations of torture, forced labor, and other forms of mistreatment in detention camps.

2. **International Response**: Various governments and international bodies have condemned China's actions in Xinjiang. The United Nations and several countries have called for investigations into the alleged human rights abuses.

3. **Chinese Government's Stance**: The Chinese government has consistently denied these allegations, claiming that the camps are vocational training centers aimed at combating extremism.

Given the substantial evidence from multiple independent sources supporting claims of human rights abuses, including torture, against Uighur Muslims in China, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim has a significant basis in fact.

Photo after questioning suspects detained in Pulwama terror attack case,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Photo after questioning suspects detained in Pulwama terror attack case,"" we need to verify the context and authenticity of the photo in question. This involves checking credible sources, official statements, and any available evidence related to the Pulwama terror attack case and the suspects involved.

Given that I don't have access to real-time data or the ability to verify images directly, I cannot definitively confirm the authenticity of the photo based on the information provided. However, if the photo has been verified by credible news sources or official statements, the claim could be considered true. Conversely, if there is no verification or if the photo is proven to be unrelated, the claim would be false.

Without specific verification details, I must base my response on the general principle of requiring evidence for such claims.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Photo showing a man's intimacy after Friday's earthquake in Turkey """,half true,mr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Photo showing a man's intimacy after Friday's earthquake in Turkey,"" we need to verify the context and authenticity of the photo in question. This involves checking reliable news sources, official statements, and any available metadata or reverse image search results.

1. **Context Verification**: Check if there was an earthquake in Turkey on the specified Friday and if there were any reports or news articles mentioning a photo showing a man's intimacy.
2. **Photo Verification**: Use reverse image search tools to see if the photo has been used in other contexts or if it has been misrepresented.
3. **Source Reliability**: Evaluate the credibility of the source that made the claim.

Without specific details or access to the photo and its context, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, based on the general approach to verifying such claims:

- If the photo is found to be unrelated to the earthquake or taken at a different time/place, the claim would be 'False'.
- If the photo is related but misrepresented in some way, the claim could be 'Mostly False' or 'Half True'.
- If the photo is accurately described and contextually correct, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided here, I would need to conduct further verification to make an accurate determination. However, based on the typical nature of such claims often being misrepresented:

Hindu daughters-in-law are being tampered with in the Muslim dominated region.,half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Hindu daughters-in-law are being tampered with in the Muslim dominated region,"" it is essential to consider the following:

1. **Source Verification**: The claim should be backed by credible sources, such as verified news reports, official statements, or reliable data.
2. **Context and Specificity**: The claim is broad and lacks specific details such as the location, time frame, and nature of the incidents.
3. **Bias and Sensationalism**: The claim could be influenced by bias or sensationalism, which is common in communal or politically charged narratives.

Without concrete evidence or specific details to substantiate the claim, it is not possible to verify its accuracy. Broad and unverified statements can contribute to misinformation and communal tension.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there have been no verified reports or credible evidence to support the claim that Tejashwi Yadav was distributing notes during an election campaign in Bihar. Such an act would likely have been widely reported and scrutinized by the media and election authorities.

Amul is closing the chilling centers indefinitely due to the Corona virus.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Amul is closing the chilling centers indefinitely due to the Corona virus,"" we need to verify the information from reliable sources.

1. **Check Official Statements**: Look for any official announcements from Amul regarding the closure of their chilling centers.
2. **News Reports**: Search for credible news articles or reports that confirm or deny this claim.
3. **Context of the Situation**: Understand the broader context of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected operations in the dairy industry, specifically Amul.

As of my last update in 2023, there have been no verified reports or official statements from Amul indicating that they are closing their chilling centers indefinitely due to the coronavirus. Amul, being a major dairy cooperative, has continued its operations with necessary precautions during the pandemic to ensure the supply chain remains intact.

"ABP news channel anchor Rubika Liaquat has said that Ramadan Iftar and Namaz are always organized in the temple, but Muslims have not organized Navratri Puja in a single mosque till date.I feel ashamed, have this secularism contract only taken by Hindu brothers.",false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim made by Rubika Liaquat, we need to evaluate the specific points she mentioned:

1. **Ramadan Iftar and Namaz in Temples**: There have been instances where temples have organized Iftar events and allowed Namaz during Ramadan. These events are often highlighted in the media as examples of communal harmony. However, it is not a widespread or common practice across all temples in India.

2. **Navratri Puja in Mosques**: There is no widely documented evidence of Navratri Puja being organized in mosques. Mosques are primarily places of worship for Muslims, and it is uncommon for them to host Hindu religious ceremonies.

3. **Secularism Contract**: The statement about a ""secularism contract"" being taken only by Hindu brothers is a subjective opinion and reflects the speaker's personal viewpoint rather than an objective fact.

Given these points, the claim contains elements of truth but also includes subjective opinions and generalizations that may not be universally applicable.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"A post on social media claiming Baba Ramdev has been viral, claiming that Baba Ramdev's 2212 crore has been forgiven.This post states ""In 2014, if Modi will come, he will get petrol in 35 #Babaramdev killed 2212 crore.",half true,gu,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Whether Baba Ramdev's debt of 2212 crore has been forgiven.
2. The context and accuracy of the statement regarding petrol prices and Modi's promises.

1. **Debt Forgiveness**: There is no credible evidence or official statement confirming that Baba Ramdev's debt of 2212 crore has been forgiven. Such a significant financial decision would likely be documented and reported by major news outlets, but there is no such information available.

2. **Petrol Prices and Modi's Promises**: The statement about petrol prices being reduced to 35 INR if Modi came to power in 2014 is a separate issue and does not directly relate to the claim about Baba Ramdev's debt. However, it is worth noting that petrol prices have not been reduced to 35 INR since Modi came to power.

Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim about debt forgiveness and the unrelated nature of the petrol price statement, the claim appears to be unfounded.

This picture is from New Zealand of people sitting in Pangat to eat food on banana leaves.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the key elements:

1. **Location: New Zealand** - The claim states that the picture is from New Zealand.
2. **Activity: People sitting in Pangat** - ""Pangat"" is a term used in Indian culture, particularly in Sikhism, referring to a community meal where people sit in rows to eat together.
3. **Eating on Banana Leaves** - This is a traditional practice in various South Asian cultures, especially in India and Sri Lanka.

Given these points, the claim seems to mix cultural practices from different regions. While it is possible for people in New Zealand to adopt and practice cultural traditions from other parts of the world, the specific combination of ""Pangat"" and eating on banana leaves is more traditionally associated with South Asian cultures rather than New Zealand.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"According to Aaj Tak's exit poll, this time Raghuvar government will be formed in Jharkhand again",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the information provided by Aaj Tak's exit poll regarding the formation of the Raghuvar government in Jharkhand. Exit polls are predictions based on surveys conducted immediately after voters leave polling stations, and they can sometimes be inaccurate.

1. **Check the Date and Context**: Exit polls are specific to election cycles. The claim must be checked against the specific election year in Jharkhand.
2. **Verify Aaj Tak's Exit Poll Data**: Look for the actual exit poll results published by Aaj Tak for the relevant election.
3. **Compare with Actual Election Results**: Compare the exit poll predictions with the actual election results to see if the Raghuvar government was indeed formed.

Without specific data from Aaj Tak's exit poll and the actual election results, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a specific past election, we can look at historical data:

- In the 2014 Jharkhand Legislative Assembly election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Raghuvar Das did form the government.
- In the 2019 Jharkhand Legislative Assembly election, the BJP did not form the government; instead, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) led by Hemant Soren came to power.

Given this context, if the claim is referring to the 2019 election, it would be 'False'. If it refers to the 2014 election, it would be 'True'. 

Since the claim does not specify the election year, and considering the most recent election (2019), the claim would be:

If the picture in question is widely recognized and historically documented as being from Indira Gandhi's funeral, then the claim could be considered 'True'. If there is any ambiguity or misidentification, the accuracy could vary.

Given the lack of specific visual content to verify, I cannot definitively assess the claim.

1. **Assassination**: We need to identify who ""he"" refers to and confirm if this person was indeed assassinated.
2. **Raping a women's constable**: We need to verify if there is any credible evidence or historical record of this person raping a women's constable.
3. **Congress rule**: We need to check if the events occurred during a period when the Congress party was in power.

Without specific details about the individual in question, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, based on general knowledge and the lack of widely known incidents matching this description, it is highly likely that the claim is fabricated or misrepresented.

The young man who went to see Garba in Gujarat was beaten to death by a mob.,half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the details through reliable sources such as news reports, official statements, or credible eyewitness accounts. 

1. **Check News Reports**: Look for recent news articles from reputable news organizations that report on an incident involving a young man being beaten to death by a mob in Gujarat while attending a Garba event.
2. **Official Statements**: Verify if there are any statements from local authorities or police confirming the incident.
3. **Eyewitness Accounts**: Look for credible eyewitness accounts or social media posts that corroborate the claim.

Without access to real-time information and verification from reliable sources, it is not possible to definitively determine the truthfulness of the claim. However, if such an incident has been widely reported and confirmed by multiple credible sources, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If there are discrepancies or lack of evidence, it could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific information and verification in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer.

Indian soldiers raped the Naga woman in Kohima.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Indian soldiers raped the Naga woman in Kohima,"" it is essential to rely on verified sources and credible information. This claim is a serious allegation and should be treated with utmost care and sensitivity.

1. **Historical Context**: The Naga conflict in Northeast India has seen various human rights violations reported over the years. However, specific incidents need to be verified through credible sources.

2. **Verification**: Without specific details or verified reports from credible sources such as human rights organizations, news agencies, or official investigations, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of this particular claim.

3. **Research**: A thorough search through reliable news archives, human rights reports, and official statements would be necessary to confirm or refute this claim.

"Barkode can distinguish in sugar and Indian products.Barcode which start from 690 to 699, are made in China.",mostly false,hi,"The claim that ""Barcode which start from 690 to 699, are made in China"" is accurate. Barcodes starting with the digits 690 to 699 are indeed assigned to China by the GS1 organization, which is responsible for managing barcode standards globally.

However, the claim that ""Barkode can distinguish in sugar and Indian products"" is unclear and seems to be incorrect. Barcodes themselves do not provide information about the type of product (such as sugar) or the specific country of origin (such as India) beyond the country code prefix. They are primarily used to identify the manufacturer and the product.

"Like Palghar, a saint attacked a saint in a strong man",half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Like Palghar, a saint attacked a saint in a strong man,"" we need to break down the components and verify them against known facts.

1. **Palghar Incident**: The Palghar incident refers to the lynching of two Hindu monks (sadhus) and their driver by a mob in Palghar, Maharashtra, India, in April 2020. This was a case of mob violence and not an attack by another saint.

2. **Saint Attacking a Saint**: The claim suggests that a saint attacked another saint. In the Palghar incident, the attackers were not saints but a mob of villagers.

3. **Strong Man**: The phrase ""in a strong man"" is ambiguous and does not clearly relate to the Palghar incident or provide any additional context that can be verified.

Given these points, the claim does not accurately describe the Palghar incident or any known event where a saint attacked another saint in a context involving a ""strong man.""

Aditya Thackeray has reached Ajmer Sharif Dargah to become CM.,half true,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Aditya Thackeray has reached Ajmer Sharif Dargah to become CM,"" we need to verify two main points: whether Aditya Thackeray has indeed visited Ajmer Sharif Dargah and whether this visit is directly linked to him becoming the Chief Minister (CM).

1. **Visit to Ajmer Sharif Dargah**: It is possible to verify through news sources or official statements whether Aditya Thackeray has visited Ajmer Sharif Dargah.

2. **Purpose of the Visit**: The claim suggests that the visit is specifically to become the Chief Minister. This implies a direct correlation between the visit and his political ambitions or actions towards becoming CM. This part of the claim is more speculative and would require substantial evidence to confirm.

Without concrete evidence supporting both points, especially the purpose of the visit, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"The youth is committing suicide with unemployment, but regardless of this, PM Modi is celebrating his birthday with industrialists.",mostly false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The youth is committing suicide with unemployment.""
2. ""PM Modi is celebrating his birthday with industrialists.""

1. **Youth Suicide and Unemployment:**
   - Youth unemployment is a significant issue in many countries, including India. There have been reports and studies indicating that unemployment can lead to severe mental health issues, including depression and suicide among the youth.
   - However, attributing youth suicides solely to unemployment without specific data or studies directly linking the two in a significant manner can be misleading. Suicides can result from a complex interplay of various factors, including mental health issues, personal problems, and socio-economic conditions.

2. **PM Modi Celebrating His Birthday with Industrialists:**
   - Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday is a public event, and his activities on this day are often covered by the media. It is possible that he meets with various stakeholders, including industrialists, on his birthday.
   - However, without specific evidence or reports confirming that he celebrated his birthday exclusively or primarily with industrialists, this part of the claim remains speculative.

Given the lack of concrete evidence to fully support both parts of the claim, it is difficult to categorize it as entirely true or false. The claim contains elements that could be partially true but lacks comprehensive evidence.

The claim that Atal Bihari Vajpayee went to Parliament House on a bullock cart to protest against Rajiv Gandhi's introduction of computers to India is false.

Clash on the Indo-China border.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Clash on the Indo-China border,"" we need to consider recent and historical context. The Indo-China border, particularly in regions like Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh, has been a site of tension and occasional clashes between Indian and Chinese forces. Notably, there was a significant clash in the Galwan Valley in June 2020, which resulted in casualties on both sides. Since then, there have been reports of occasional skirmishes and standoffs, although not all incidents are widely reported or confirmed.

Given this context, the claim that there has been a ""clash"" on the Indo-China border is plausible and aligns with known historical and recent events.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
A picture of Babri Masjid where Muslims are offering prayers for the last time.,false,hi,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the historical context and available evidence regarding the Babri Masjid.

The Babri Masjid was a mosque in Ayodhya, India, that was demolished on December 6, 1992. The last time Muslims were able to offer prayers in the Babri Masjid was in 1949, after which the site became a point of contention and was locked by the government. The mosque was not accessible for regular prayers after that period.

Given this historical context, any picture claiming to show Muslims offering prayers in the Babri Masjid for the last time would have to be from 1949 or earlier. If the picture is from a later date, it would not be accurate.

3. Whether the recovery took place in a madrasa in Bijnar, Uttar Pradesh.

3. This event was significant enough to be noted as a world record or notable achievement.

Upon researching, it is found that Mahesh Bhatt directed the movie ""Sadak 2,"" whose trailer received a significant number of dislikes on YouTube.

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the image has been reported by credible news organizations or verified by fact-checking websites.
2. **Context**: Understand the context in which the image was taken. Was it during a specific event or protest? What were the circumstances?
3. **Authenticity**: Ensure the image has not been doctored or taken out of context to mislead viewers.

Without access to the specific image and the ability to conduct a thorough investigation, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if the image has been widely reported and verified by credible sources, the claim could be considered accurate. Conversely, if the image has been debunked or lacks credible verification, the claim would be false.

Given the need for specific verification and context, I cannot provide a definitive answer without further information.
