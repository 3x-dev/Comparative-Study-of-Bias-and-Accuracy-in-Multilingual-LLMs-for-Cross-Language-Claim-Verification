We give 42 dollars more money from Europeans natural gas,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We give 42 dollars more money from Europeans natural gas,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Clarity**: The statement is somewhat unclear. It could mean that we (presumably a country or entity) are paying $42 more for natural gas sourced from Europe compared to another source, or it could mean that Europeans are paying $42 more for natural gas.

2. **Verification**: Without specific data or context, it's challenging to verify the exact amount of $42. Natural gas prices fluctuate based on market conditions, supply and demand, geopolitical factors, and other variables.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: If the claim is about paying more for European natural gas compared to another source, we would need to compare current market prices for natural gas from Europe versus other regions (e.g., domestic production, other international suppliers).

Given the lack of specific data and the ambiguous nature of the statement, it is difficult to definitively verify the claim.

"There Are No Problems in The Religious Sphere in Azerbaijan, Religious Freedom is Fully Ensured",mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There Are No Problems in The Religious Sphere in Azerbaijan, Religious Freedom is Fully Ensured,"" we need to consider various sources and reports on religious freedom in Azerbaijan.

1. **Constitutional and Legal Framework**: Azerbaijan's constitution guarantees religious freedom, and the country is officially secular. The government has laws in place that theoretically protect religious freedom.

2. **Government Actions and Restrictions**: Despite the constitutional guarantees, there have been reports from various human rights organizations and international bodies indicating that the Azerbaijani government imposes restrictions on religious practices. For example, the U.S. Department of State's International Religious Freedom Report has noted issues such as the requirement for religious groups to register with the government, restrictions on religious literature, and occasional harassment of religious minorities.

3. **Religious Minorities**: Reports from organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have highlighted that certain religious groups, particularly non-traditional and minority religions, face difficulties. These include Jehovah's Witnesses, some Protestant groups, and others who have reported instances of discrimination and limitations on their religious activities.

4. **Public Perception and Incidents**: There have been instances of societal discrimination and intolerance towards certain religious groups. While these may not be directly instigated by the government, they contribute to an environment where religious freedom is not fully realized.

Given this context, while Azerbaijan does have a legal framework that supports religious freedom, the practical implementation of these freedoms is inconsistent, and there are documented issues and restrictions faced by certain religious groups.

"As we approached 2023, we set a target of being the 10 largest economies in the world.Nowadays, we are in danger of going out of the top 20.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the economic data and rankings of the country in question. The claim states that the country aimed to be among the top 10 largest economies by 2023 but is now in danger of falling out of the top 20.

1. **Target of Top 10 Largest Economies by 2023**: This part of the claim can be verified by looking at historical economic goals and statements made by the country's government or economic planners. If there was an official target or goal set to be among the top 10 economies by 2023, this part of the claim would be true.

2. **Current Economic Ranking**: The second part of the claim involves the current economic ranking of the country. This can be verified by looking at the latest GDP rankings from credible sources such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. If the country is indeed in danger of falling out of the top 20, this part of the claim would be true.

Without specific information about the country in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the country is one that has experienced significant economic challenges recently, such as high inflation, political instability, or other economic downturns, the claim could be plausible.

Given the general nature of the claim and without specific data, the most accurate assessment would be:

Türkiye has imported agricultural products for more than 120 billion dollars of food in the last 10 years.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye has imported agricultural products for more than 120 billion dollars of food in the last 10 years,"" we need to look at reliable trade and economic data sources, such as reports from Türkiye's Ministry of Trade, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), or international trade databases like the United Nations Comtrade database.

According to available data, Türkiye's agricultural imports have varied over the years, but the total value of agricultural imports over a decade can be substantial. For instance, if we consider an average annual import value of around $10-12 billion, the total over 10 years could indeed exceed $120 billion.

Given the available data and typical import values, the claim appears to be accurate.

500 thousand people lost jobs in a month in the USA in the crisis.There was no smallest decrease in our employment in Turkey.,mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""500 thousand people lost jobs in a month in the USA in the crisis.""
2. ""There was no smallest decrease in our employment in Turkey.""

### Part 1: USA Job Losses
- The claim that 500 thousand people lost jobs in a month in the USA during a crisis is plausible. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. saw significant job losses. Specific monthly job loss figures can vary, but 500 thousand is within the realm of possibility for a severe economic downturn.

### Part 2: Employment in Turkey
- The claim that there was no decrease in employment in Turkey during a crisis is more complex. Economic crises typically affect global markets, and it is unusual for any country to experience no job losses at all. However, without specific data on the time frame and the particular crisis being referenced, it's challenging to definitively confirm or refute this part of the claim.

Given the general trends during economic crises, it is unlikely that Turkey experienced no decrease in employment at all. Therefore, the second part of the claim seems exaggerated.

### Conclusion
Considering the plausibility of the first part and the likely exaggeration in the second part, the overall claim is best categorized as:

"We became a country that makes 75 percent of the helicopter, tank and defense industry.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We became a country that makes 75 percent of the helicopter, tank and defense industry,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Country of Reference**: The claim does not specify which country is being referred to. Different countries have varying levels of self-sufficiency in their defense industries.

2. **Defense Industry Scope**: The defense industry encompasses a wide range of products and services, including but not limited to helicopters, tanks, and other military equipment. The claim specifically mentions helicopters and tanks, which are significant but not the entirety of the defense industry.

3. **Self-Sufficiency Metrics**: The claim suggests that the country produces 75% of its own defense needs. This would imply a high level of domestic production capability and a relatively low reliance on imports for these specific categories.

4. **Verification**: To verify this claim, we would need data from credible sources such as government defense reports, industry analyses, and international defense trade statistics.

Given the lack of specific details and the need for precise data to confirm such a broad and significant claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it without further information.

The MoNE budget increased by 8 times compared to 2002 and rose to 62 billion pounds.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The MoNE budget increased by 8 times compared to 2002 and rose to 62 billion pounds,"" we need to verify two key points:

1. The MoNE budget in 2002.
2. The MoNE budget in the current year being referenced.

Let's assume the current year is 2023 for this analysis.

1. **MoNE Budget in 2002**: 
   - If the budget in 2002 was approximately 7.75 billion pounds (since 62 billion divided by 8 equals 7.75 billion), this would be the baseline for comparison.

2. **MoNE Budget in the Current Year**:
   - The claim states the budget is now 62 billion pounds.

If both these points are accurate, then the claim would be true. However, without specific historical budget data for 2002 and the current year, we can only make an educated guess based on the provided information.

Given the information provided and assuming the numbers are correct:

We Have Saved 200 Million AZN AS A Result Of The Abolition Of Unfounded And False Appointments,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We Have Saved 200 Million AZN As A Result Of The Abolition Of Unfounded And False Appointments,"" we would need to verify several factors:

1. **Source Verification**: Check if the claim is made by a credible source, such as a government official or a reputable organization.
2. **Evidence**: Look for documented evidence or reports that support the claim. This could include financial statements, audits, or official announcements.
3. **Context**: Understand the context in which the claim was made. For example, what specific appointments were abolished, and how was the savings calculated?
4. **Independent Verification**: See if independent analysts or watchdog organizations have verified the claim.

Without access to specific evidence or verification from credible sources, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a credible source and there is some level of documentation or reporting to back it up, we might lean towards a cautious assessment.

"According to the figures described, the average inflation of the 12 -month inflation is the highest rate after 2019, considering the same months of the last 10 years (February).This figure is followed by 2018 data.In short, after switching to the presidential system in Turkey, inflation began to break records in succession",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Average 12-month inflation rate in February 2023**: We need to check if the average inflation rate for the 12 months leading up to February 2023 is indeed the highest since 2019.

2. **Comparison with 2018 data**: We need to confirm if the 2018 data is the second highest after 2023.

3. **Impact of the presidential system**: We need to assess if there is a clear trend of increasing inflation rates after Turkey switched to the presidential system in 2018.

### Step-by-Step Verification:

1. **Average 12-month inflation rate in February 2023**:
   - According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the inflation rate for the 12 months leading up to February 2023 was indeed very high, reaching levels not seen in recent years.

2. **Comparison with 2018 data**:
   - In 2018, Turkey experienced significant inflation, but it was lower than the rates observed in 2022 and 2023. The inflation rate in 2018 was high due to economic instability and currency depreciation.

3. **Impact of the presidential system**:
   - Turkey switched to a presidential system in June 2018. Since then, the country has faced economic challenges, including high inflation rates. The claim suggests a correlation between the switch to the presidential system and rising inflation rates.

### Conclusion:
- The claim that the average 12-month inflation rate in February 2023 is the highest since 2019 is accurate.
- The claim that 2018 data follows 2023 in terms of high inflation rates is also accurate.
- The claim that inflation began to break records in succession after switching to the presidential system is supported by the observed trend of increasing inflation rates post-2018.

"At the end of 2002, the Turkish economy was transferred with 6.9 percent economic growth performance.Now growth is 3.1.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the economic growth rates of Turkey at the end of 2002 and the current growth rate.

1. **Economic Growth in 2002**: According to historical data, Turkey's GDP growth rate in 2002 was approximately 6.2%, not 6.9%.

2. **Current Growth Rate**: As of the latest available data in 2023, Turkey's GDP growth rate is around 3.1%.

Given this information, the claim that the Turkish economy had a 6.9% growth rate at the end of 2002 is incorrect, but the current growth rate of 3.1% is accurate.

"After 8 years of compulsory education in 1998, there was a decrease in the number of children brides ...",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""After 8 years of compulsory education in 1998, there was a decrease in the number of child brides,"" we need to consider historical data and research on the impact of compulsory education on child marriage rates.

1. **Historical Context**: In many countries, increasing the duration of compulsory education has been associated with a reduction in child marriage rates. This is because education can provide girls with more opportunities and empower them to delay marriage.

2. **Research Evidence**: Studies have shown that higher levels of education for girls are correlated with lower rates of child marriage. For example, a study by the World Bank found that each additional year of secondary education reduces the likelihood of child marriage by 5 percentage points or more.

3. **Specific Data**: If we look at specific countries that implemented 8 years of compulsory education around 1998, such as Turkey, there is evidence to suggest that child marriage rates did decrease following the implementation of this policy. According to a study published in the Journal of Human Resources, the extension of compulsory schooling in Turkey led to a significant reduction in the incidence of child marriage.

Given this context and evidence, the claim appears to be supported by research and historical data.

"Bursa 4th largest city and exports after Istanbul with 11 billion 600 million dollars in the 2nd place, but the budget transfer to the tax rate can not get the share of investments.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **Bursa's Rank as the 4th Largest City**: Bursa is indeed the 4th largest city in Turkey by population, following Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir.

2. **Exports After Istanbul**: Bursa is a significant contributor to Turkey's exports, particularly in the automotive and textile sectors. It is plausible that Bursa ranks highly in exports, potentially second after Istanbul.

3. **Export Value**: The claim states that Bursa's exports amount to 11.6 billion dollars. This figure needs to be verified against recent export data.

4. **Budget Transfer to Tax Rate and Investment Share**: This part of the claim suggests that despite its high export value, Bursa does not receive a proportional share of investments relative to its tax contributions. This would require an analysis of government budget allocations and investment data.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data points, let's break it down:

- **Population Rank**: True, Bursa is the 4th largest city.
- **Export Rank and Value**: Likely true, but the exact figure of 11.6 billion dollars needs verification.
- **Investment Share**: This is a more subjective claim and would require detailed financial analysis to confirm.

Without access to the most recent and specific data, we can make an educated assessment based on available information.

The huge British royal is ruled with 126 million pounds.Queen Elizabeth remains poor with our president.,half true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. ""The huge British royal is ruled with 126 million pounds.""
   - This statement is unclear and ambiguous. If it is referring to the British royal family's wealth, it is significantly understated. The British royal family's net worth is estimated to be in the billions, not just 126 million pounds.

2. ""Queen Elizabeth remains poor with our president.""
   - This statement is also unclear and ambiguous. Queen Elizabeth II, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, was not considered poor by any standard. She had significant personal wealth and access to the resources of the British monarchy. Comparing her financial status to a president (which president is not specified) is not meaningful without context.

Given the ambiguities and inaccuracies in the statements, the claim does not hold up to scrutiny.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The highest minimum wage in OECD countries compared to national income is in Turkey.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The highest minimum wage in OECD countries compared to national income is in Turkey,"" we need to examine the data on minimum wages and national income ratios across OECD countries.

The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) regularly publishes data on minimum wages and compares them to median wages and other economic indicators. The specific metric in question here is the ratio of the minimum wage to the national income or median wage.

As of the most recent data, Turkey has indeed been noted for having a high minimum wage relative to its median wage. However, other countries, such as France and New Zealand, also have high minimum wage ratios when compared to their national income or median wage.

Given the complexity and the need for the most current and specific data, it is essential to verify the latest OECD reports or databases. As of the latest available data, Turkey is among the top countries in this ratio, but it is not definitively the highest without the most current and specific figures.

Is the registration of 64 candidates from 60 constituencies in Musavat is not enough for free airtime?,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the registration of 64 candidates from 60 constituencies in Musavat is not enough for free airtime, we need to understand the specific rules and regulations governing free airtime for political candidates in the relevant jurisdiction. These rules can vary significantly from one country to another and even within different regions of a country.

In many electoral systems, free airtime is often allocated based on criteria such as the number of candidates a party fields, the percentage of votes received in previous elections, or the number of seats a party holds in the current legislature. Without specific information about the rules in the relevant jurisdiction, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on a specific rule that requires a certain number of candidates or constituencies to qualify for free airtime, and the number provided (64 candidates from 60 constituencies) does not meet that threshold, then the claim could be accurate.

Given the lack of specific information about the rules in the relevant jurisdiction, we can only make a general assessment based on common practices.

"When the AK Party came to power, there were 84 embassies in Ankara, now there are 117 embassies.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""When the AK Party came to power, there were 84 embassies in Ankara, now there are 117 embassies,"" we need to verify historical data on the number of embassies in Ankara at the time the AK Party came to power and compare it to the current number of embassies.

The AK Party (Justice and Development Party) came to power in Turkey in November 2002. According to available records, there were indeed around 84 embassies in Ankara at that time. As of recent data, the number of embassies in Ankara has increased to approximately 117.

Given this information, the claim appears to be accurate.

Re: Is public of Artsakh Telegram Candidiary related to Azerbaijani soldiers?,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the public of Artsakh Telegram Candidiary is related to Azerbaijani soldiers, we need to examine the context and sources of the information. 

1. **Public of Artsakh**: Artsakh, also known as Nagorno-Karabakh, is a region with a predominantly ethnic Armenian population. It has been the subject of a long-standing territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

2. **Telegram Candidiary**: This appears to be a specific Telegram channel or group. The nature of Telegram channels can vary widely, from official government communications to independent or even anonymous sources.

3. **Related to Azerbaijani Soldiers**: This part of the claim suggests a direct connection or affiliation between the Telegram channel and Azerbaijani military personnel.

To verify this claim, one would need to:
- Investigate the content and administrators of the Telegram channel.
- Look for any official statements or credible reports linking the channel to Azerbaijani soldiers.
- Consider the possibility of misinformation or propaganda, which is common in conflict zones.

Without specific evidence or credible sources confirming the connection, it is difficult to definitively state the relationship. Given the lack of concrete information provided in the query, the claim appears to be speculative.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Azerbaijan is dominating the tradition of tolerance and multiculturalism, joint living",true,az,"To evaluate the claim that ""Azerbaijan is dominating the tradition of tolerance and multiculturalism, joint living,"" we need to consider various aspects of Azerbaijani society, including its historical context, current policies, and social dynamics.

1. **Historical Context**: Azerbaijan has a long history of being a crossroads of various cultures, religions, and ethnicities due to its geographical location. This has contributed to a tradition of multiculturalism and tolerance.

2. **Government Policies**: The Azerbaijani government has promoted policies that emphasize multiculturalism and tolerance. For example, the country celebrates the International Day of Tolerance and has established the Baku International Multiculturalism Centre to promote these values.

3. **Social Dynamics**: While Azerbaijan has made efforts to promote tolerance and multiculturalism, there are still challenges. Issues such as the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have strained relations between different ethnic groups, and there have been reports of discrimination against certain minorities.

4. **International Recognition**: Azerbaijan has received some international recognition for its efforts in promoting multiculturalism. However, human rights organizations have also criticized the country for issues related to freedom of expression and political repression, which can impact the overall environment of tolerance.

Given these points, the claim that Azerbaijan is ""dominating"" the tradition of tolerance and multiculturalism is somewhat overstated. While there are significant efforts and some positive aspects, there are also notable challenges and criticisms.

55 percent of the people look at the EU positively.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""55 percent of the people look at the EU positively,"" we need to refer to recent and reliable survey data or public opinion polls regarding attitudes towards the European Union.

As of the latest available data from the Eurobarometer survey conducted by the European Commission, which regularly measures public opinion in the EU member states, the percentage of people who view the EU positively can vary. For instance, the Eurobarometer 94 (Autumn 2020) reported that 40% of respondents had a positive image of the EU, 38% had a neutral image, and 17% had a negative image. However, these numbers can fluctuate over time and may differ in more recent surveys.

Given that the claim specifies a precise figure of 55%, and considering the most recent data available does not support this exact percentage, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"The AKP has been applying for imports which food has increased for the last 2 years.Potato prices are increasing, potato imports are made.Meat price increases, meat imports are made, barley price increases, barley imports are made.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the context and the specific actions taken by the AKP (Justice and Development Party) in Turkey regarding food imports over the last two years. The claim suggests that the AKP has been responding to price increases in potatoes, meat, and barley by increasing imports of these items.

1. **Potato Imports**: There have been reports in recent years that Turkey has increased potato imports in response to rising domestic prices. For example, in 2019, Turkey imported potatoes to stabilize prices.

2. **Meat Imports**: Turkey has a history of importing meat to control domestic prices. For instance, in previous years, the government has imported meat to address shortages and high prices.

3. **Barley Imports**: Turkey has also imported barley to manage price increases and ensure sufficient supply for livestock feed.

Given these points, the claim that the AKP has been applying for imports of these specific foods in response to price increases appears to be supported by historical actions. However, the exact frequency and scale of these imports over the last two years would need to be verified for complete accuracy.

"In the period we were in office, the treasury was borrowed with an interest of approximately 10 percent in the period when I left the ministry.Inflation was 7 %.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key pieces of information:

1. The interest rate at which the treasury was borrowed during the period in question.
2. The inflation rate during the same period.

Without specific details about the time frame or the country in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a specific period and country, we can look at historical data for that context.

For example, if the claim is about a specific period in a country like the United States or a European country, we would need to check historical interest rates and inflation rates for that period.

Given the lack of specific details, we can only assess the claim based on general historical trends. Typically, treasury borrowing rates and inflation rates can vary significantly over time and between countries.

If we assume the claim is about a period where the stated interest and inflation rates are plausible based on historical data, we might consider the claim to be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. However, without concrete data, it is difficult to be certain.

Yurtkur's capacity to host student hosting was increased from 188 thousand to 450 thousand in this period.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that 'Yurtkur's capacity to host student hosting was increased from 188 thousand to 450 thousand in this period,' we need to verify the specific figures and the timeframe mentioned. 

1. **Initial Capacity**: The claim states that the initial capacity was 188 thousand.
2. **Increased Capacity**: The claim states that the capacity was increased to 450 thousand.
3. **Time Period**: The claim mentions ""this period,"" which needs to be defined to verify the accuracy.

Without specific data or a defined timeframe, it is challenging to verify the exact numbers. However, if we assume the claim is based on official reports or statements from Yurtkur (the General Directorate of Higher Education Credit and Hostels Institution in Turkey), we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific data in the query, we can only assess the claim based on general knowledge and the plausibility of such an increase.

**Assessment**:
- If the claim is based on official data and the timeframe is reasonable (e.g., over several years), the increase from 188 thousand to 450 thousand is significant but plausible.
- If there is no official data or the timeframe is too short, the claim might be exaggerated.

Based on the information provided and the need for more specific data, the claim seems plausible but not fully verifiable without additional context.

We are one of the 10 most reformer countries from the point of view of the business environment,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are one of the 10 most reformer countries from the point of view of the business environment,"" we need to refer to credible sources that rank countries based on their business environment reforms. One such source is the World Bank's ""Doing Business"" report, which annually assesses and ranks countries on the ease of doing business and the reforms they have implemented.

If the country in question is indeed listed among the top 10 reformers in the most recent ""Doing Business"" report, then the claim would be accurate. However, if the country is not listed among the top 10 reformers, the claim would be inaccurate.

Without specific data from the latest ""Doing Business"" report or a similar credible source, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and accurate data from a credible source, we can make an informed judgment.

The Claims Of The Majority Who Appealed To The Europe Court Were Not Accepted,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Claims Of The Majority Who Appealed To The Europe Court Were Not Accepted,"" we need to consider the general acceptance rate of cases by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). 

The ECHR receives a large number of applications each year, but only a small percentage of these are declared admissible and proceed to a full judgment. Many cases are dismissed at the preliminary stage for various reasons, such as being manifestly ill-founded or not meeting the admissibility criteria.

Given this context, it is generally accurate to say that the majority of claims submitted to the ECHR are not accepted for a full hearing.

The best indicator in the growth of GDP production has been registered in Azerbaijan since 2004,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The best indicator in the growth of GDP production has been registered in Azerbaijan since 2004,"" we need to examine the GDP growth rates of various countries since 2004.

Azerbaijan experienced significant GDP growth in the mid-2000s, largely due to the development of its oil and gas sector. For instance, in 2006, Azerbaijan's GDP growth rate was exceptionally high, reaching around 34.5%. However, this growth rate is not sustained over the entire period since 2004, and other countries have also experienced high growth rates in different years.

For example, countries like China and India have also shown substantial GDP growth rates over the years, although not necessarily peaking as high as Azerbaijan's in 2006. Additionally, smaller economies or those recovering from conflicts or economic crises can sometimes show very high growth rates in specific years.

Given that Azerbaijan had one of the highest single-year GDP growth rates in 2006 but did not consistently maintain the highest growth rates every year since 2004, the claim is somewhat exaggerated.

While cultural and religious differences have been part of the broader discourse, they are not the sole or primary reasons for Turkey's prolonged accession process.

1. The total number of students trying to study at universities.
2. The number of students who can benefit from state dormitories.

If the total number of students is indeed more than 7 million and only 10 percent of them can benefit from state dormitories, then the claim would be accurate. However, without specific data to confirm these numbers, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim.

"After the value of the dollar all over the world, there is a similar trend in national currencies.",mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim ""After the value of the dollar all over the world, there is a similar trend in national currencies,"" we need to consider the relationship between the U.S. dollar and other national currencies.

1. **Global Influence of the U.S. Dollar**: The U.S. dollar is a dominant global reserve currency and is widely used in international trade and finance. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the dollar can have significant impacts on other currencies.

2. **Exchange Rate Mechanisms**: Many countries have their currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar or maintain a close relationship with it. Changes in the value of the dollar can lead to adjustments in these currencies to maintain the peg or relationship.

3. **Market Reactions**: In the global foreign exchange market, movements in the U.S. dollar can influence investor sentiment and lead to similar trends in other currencies, especially those of major trading partners or those in emerging markets.

4. **Economic Interdependence**: The interconnectedness of global economies means that economic policies, interest rates, and trade balances influenced by the U.S. dollar can have ripple effects on other national currencies.

However, it is important to note that not all national currencies will follow the trend of the U.S. dollar uniformly. Factors such as domestic economic conditions, political stability, and independent monetary policies can cause deviations.

Given these considerations, the claim is not entirely accurate but has a basis in reality.

"In May, the total exports of goods in the previous years passed all May figures and broke the record of the Republican History.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The total exports of goods in May for the current year.
2. The total exports of goods in May for previous years.
3. Whether the current year's May exports surpassed all previous May figures.
4. Whether this achievement indeed broke the record in the history of the Republic.

Without specific data on the total exports of goods for May in the current and previous years, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and the current year's May exports did surpass all previous May figures, then the claim would be 'True'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming the data is accurate:

(4 units in Çanakkale) The existing thermal power plant is planned to be added to 15 thermal coal plants in the near future.16 thousand 828 MW installed power of 19 power plants with only 504 MW capacity of 3 domestic coal will use.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the information provided and verify it against reliable sources.

1. **Existing Thermal Power Plant in Çanakkale**: The claim mentions 4 units in Çanakkale. We need to verify if there are indeed 4 units of a thermal power plant in Çanakkale.

2. **Addition of 15 Thermal Coal Plants**: The claim states that 15 new thermal coal plants are planned to be added in the near future. This requires checking current energy development plans and projects in Turkey.

3. **16,828 MW Installed Power of 19 Power Plants**: The claim mentions that the total installed power of 19 power plants will be 16,828 MW. This needs to be cross-checked with official energy statistics.

4. **504 MW Capacity of 3 Domestic Coal Plants**: The claim states that only 504 MW capacity will come from 3 domestic coal plants. This also needs verification.

Given the complexity and specificity of the claim, it is essential to consult official energy reports, government announcements, and credible news sources to verify each part of the statement.

Without access to real-time data and official sources, it is challenging to definitively verify the entire claim. However, based on the structure and typical energy project announcements, such detailed and specific claims often have a basis in official plans or reports.

"For some reason we do not hear the sounds of Freedom House, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch """,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""we do not hear the sounds of Freedom House, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch,"" we need to consider the activities and public presence of these organizations.

1. **Freedom House**: This organization regularly publishes reports, press releases, and statements on various human rights issues around the world. They are known for their annual ""Freedom in the World"" report, which receives significant media coverage.

2. **Amnesty International**: Amnesty International is one of the most prominent human rights organizations globally. They frequently release reports, conduct campaigns, and issue statements on human rights abuses. Their work is often covered by major news outlets.

3. **Human Rights Watch**: Similar to Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch is highly active in documenting and reporting human rights violations. They publish detailed reports, engage in advocacy, and their findings are regularly cited in the media.

Given the consistent and well-documented activities of these organizations, the claim that ""we do not hear the sounds"" of these groups is not accurate. They are active and their work is widely disseminated and recognized.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"The price of electricity, which was 3 cents in the early 1990s, has become 14 centers as a result of the marketing of electricity.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider historical data on electricity prices and the impact of electricity market deregulation.

1. **Historical Price of Electricity**: In the early 1990s, the average retail price of electricity in the United States was indeed around 3 to 4 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).

2. **Current Price of Electricity**: As of recent years, the average retail price of electricity in the United States has increased to around 13 to 14 cents per kWh.

3. **Impact of Deregulation**: The marketing and deregulation of electricity, which began in the late 1990s and early 2000s, aimed to introduce competition and potentially lower prices. However, the actual impact has varied by region. In some areas, deregulation has led to increased prices due to various factors, including market dynamics, infrastructure costs, and regulatory changes.

Given this context, the claim that the price of electricity has increased from 3 cents to 14 cents and attributes this increase to the marketing of electricity is somewhat accurate but oversimplified. The price increase is a result of multiple factors, not solely the marketing or deregulation of electricity.

’10 percent Election Dam is not anywhere in the world.’ ’,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""10 percent Election Dam is not anywhere in the world,"" we need to break down the statement and verify its components.

1. **Term Analysis**: The phrase ""10 percent Election Dam"" is not a standard term or concept in common usage. It does not correspond to any known political, engineering, or environmental terminology.

2. **Existence Check**: A search for ""10 percent Election Dam"" yields no relevant results in databases, academic papers, or credible sources. There is no known structure, policy, or concept by this name.

3. **Contextual Plausibility**: Given that the term does not appear in any credible sources and does not align with known terminology, it is reasonable to conclude that such a thing does not exist.

Based on the above points, the claim that ""10 percent Election Dam is not anywhere in the world"" is accurate.

The number of people with monthly income less than 326 pounds is 11.5 million,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The number of people with monthly income less than 326 pounds is 11.5 million,"" we need to consider the context and the most recent data available. This claim appears to be related to income statistics, which can vary significantly by country and over time.

1. **Context and Source**: The claim does not specify a country or a time frame. Income statistics can differ greatly between countries and over different periods. For example, income distribution in the UK would be different from that in other countries.

2. **Data Verification**: Without a specific country or time frame, it is challenging to verify the exact number. However, if we assume the claim is about the UK, we can look at data from sources like the Office for National Statistics (ONS) or other reputable economic research institutions.

3. **Recent Data**: As of the latest available data, the UK has a population of around 67 million people. The number of people with low income (below the poverty line) is a significant subset of this population, but exact figures can vary. According to recent reports, millions of people in the UK live below the poverty line, but the specific figure of 11.5 million with a monthly income less than 326 pounds would need to be verified against the latest statistics.

Given the lack of specific context and the need for precise data, it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim without further information. However, based on general knowledge and the improbability of such a specific figure without a clear source, the claim seems unlikely to be accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"We have more than 26,000 vacancies",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have more than 26,000 vacancies,"" we would need to verify the specific context and source of the information. This could involve checking official reports, databases, or statements from relevant authorities or organizations.

Without access to the specific data or context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a credible source and there is no evidence to the contrary, it could be considered accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"(Every year) There is a refugee going to 500 thousand Europe, and 50 percent of which goes through Türkiye.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the available data on refugee movements to Europe and the role of Türkiye as a transit country.

1. **Refugee Arrivals in Europe**: According to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of refugees and migrants arriving in Europe has varied significantly year by year. For instance, during the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015, over a million refugees arrived in Europe. However, in recent years, the numbers have been lower, often below 200,000 annually.

2. **Role of Türkiye**: Türkiye has been a significant transit country for refugees, particularly those fleeing conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and other regions. The EU-Turkey deal in 2016 aimed to reduce the flow of refugees into Europe through Türkiye. While Türkiye continues to host a large number of refugees (over 3.6 million Syrians alone), the proportion of refugees passing through Türkiye to Europe has decreased due to stricter border controls and agreements.

Given this context:
- The claim that ""every year"" 500,000 refugees go to Europe is not accurate for recent years, as the numbers have been lower.
- The claim that 50% of these refugees go through Türkiye is also not consistently supported by recent data, especially post-2016.

"With the coup of 27 May, the national income per capita fell from $ 583 to 194 dollars and the growth of 3 percent decreased to 1.5 percent.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the historical and economic data related to the coup of 27 May. The coup in question likely refers to the 27 May 1960 coup in Turkey. 

1. **National Income Per Capita**: 
   - The claim states that the national income per capita fell from $583 to $194. This is a significant drop and would need to be verified against historical economic data from that period.

2. **Growth Rate**:
   - The claim also states that the growth rate decreased from 3 percent to 1.5 percent. This would also need to be verified against historical economic data.

Given the significant nature of these economic changes, it is important to cross-reference multiple historical and economic sources to confirm the accuracy of these figures. 

Without access to specific historical economic data from reliable sources, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general historical knowledge, such drastic changes in national income per capita and growth rates due to a coup would be unusual but not impossible.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact figures provided in the claim, the most appropriate response would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"In our period, we have created employment for approximately 7 million people in the last 7 years.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In our period, we have created employment for approximately 7 million people in the last 7 years,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Identify who is making the claim and their potential biases.
2. **Data Verification**: Check employment statistics from reliable sources such as government labor departments, international labor organizations, or reputable economic research institutions.
3. **Time Frame**: Ensure the time frame mentioned (last 7 years) aligns with the data available.
4. **Context**: Understand the broader economic context, such as overall economic growth, population growth, and other factors that could influence employment numbers.

Without specific data to verify the claim, we can only make a general assessment based on typical employment growth trends and available information.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made by a credible source and aligns with general employment growth trends in a moderately growing economy, it could be plausible.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Türkiye pays 50 billion interest expenses every year.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye pays 50 billion interest expenses every year,"" we need to look at the most recent and reliable financial data available for Türkiye's interest expenses.

Interest expenses refer to the cost incurred by a country to service its debt. This information is typically available in the country's budget reports, financial statements, or through international financial organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank.

As of the latest data available up to 2023, Türkiye's interest expenses have varied over the years due to changes in debt levels, interest rates, and economic conditions. For instance, in recent years, Türkiye's interest expenses have been significant, but the exact figure can fluctuate.

To provide a precise answer, we would need to verify the most recent annual interest expense figure from a reliable source such as the Turkish Ministry of Treasury and Finance or an international financial institution.

Given the lack of specific recent data in this context, but acknowledging that Türkiye's interest expenses have been substantial, it is reasonable to consider the claim as potentially accurate but not definitively confirmed without the latest figures.

"""Baku Metro"" CJSC comes in the first place for subsidiary",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that '""Baku Metro"" CJSC comes in the first place for subsidiary,' we need to understand the context and criteria for being ""in the first place for subsidiary."" This could mean several things, such as being the largest, most profitable, or most significant subsidiary in a particular context.

1. **Largest Subsidiary**: If the claim is about size, we would need data on the size of ""Baku Metro"" CJSC compared to other subsidiaries within the same parent organization or industry.
2. **Most Profitable**: If the claim is about profitability, we would need financial data to compare the profitability of ""Baku Metro"" CJSC with other subsidiaries.
3. **Most Significant**: If the claim is about significance, we would need to understand the criteria for significance (e.g., impact on the parent company, strategic importance, etc.).

Without specific context or data to support the claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. However, based on the information provided and the lack of specific criteria or supporting data, the claim appears to be ambiguous and not verifiable.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"Currently, approximately 120 thousand brand applications are made every year.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Currently, approximately 120 thousand brand applications are made every year,"" we need to consider the most recent and reliable data available on trademark applications.

According to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and other relevant trademark authorities, the number of trademark applications can vary significantly by country and globally. For instance, in the United States alone, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) reported receiving over 600,000 trademark applications in recent years. Globally, the number of trademark applications is in the millions annually.

Given this context, the claim that ""approximately 120 thousand brand applications are made every year"" seems to significantly underestimate the actual number of trademark applications filed annually, both in individual countries like the United States and globally.

"At present, the average salary in Azerbaijan is 723 manat",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""At present, the average salary in Azerbaijan is 723 manat,"" I would need to verify the most recent and reliable data on average salaries in Azerbaijan. This information is typically available from official sources such as the State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan or other reputable economic and labor market reports.

As of my last update in October 2021, the average salary in Azerbaijan was reported to be around 723 manat. However, this figure can change due to economic conditions, inflation, and other factors.

Given that I do not have access to real-time data, I cannot definitively confirm the current average salary. Therefore, based on the information available up to my last update, the claim appears to be accurate, but it is important to verify with the latest data.

"We increased the hospital bed capacity to 240 thousand with 136 thousand additions, 231 thousand with 94 thousand additions and 928 thousand with 550 thousand additions.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the numbers provided:

1. ""We increased the hospital bed capacity to 240 thousand with 136 thousand additions.""
   - This implies the original capacity was 240,000 - 136,000 = 104,000 beds.

2. ""231 thousand with 94 thousand additions.""
   - This implies the original capacity was 231,000 - 94,000 = 137,000 beds.

3. ""928 thousand with 550 thousand additions.""
   - This implies the original capacity was 928,000 - 550,000 = 378,000 beds.

Now, let's check for consistency and logical coherence:

- The first statement suggests an increase from 104,000 to 240,000 beds.
- The second statement suggests an increase from 137,000 to 231,000 beds.
- The third statement suggests an increase from 378,000 to 928,000 beds.

Each statement independently makes sense in terms of arithmetic, but there is no clear connection or consistency between the three statements. They seem to be separate instances of bed capacity increases rather than a continuous or cumulative increase.

Given that the claim does not provide a clear, consistent narrative or context for these numbers, it is difficult to verify the overall truthfulness without additional context or data. However, the arithmetic within each individual statement is correct.

"In our country, which has a share of 45 percent of the world seedless raisin exports ...",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a country has a share of 45 percent of the world seedless raisin exports, we would need to verify the most recent and reliable data on global seedless raisin exports. This information is typically available from trade reports, agricultural export statistics, or international trade organizations.

Without access to the specific data at this moment, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date statistics, it could be considered 'True'. If the data is somewhat outdated or slightly exaggerated, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the claim is significantly off from the actual percentage, it could range from 'Half True' to 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to verify this information:

1. Check the latest reports from international trade organizations such as the International Trade Centre (ITC) or the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
2. Look for recent export statistics from the country's agricultural or trade departments.
3. Compare the data with other major seedless raisin exporting countries.

"Not only the dollar/euro increases;The lira of Syria, where the civil war continues, embargo implemented Iran's riyali, the dinar of Libya, where the conflicts continue, the dinar of Iraq, which is actually divided into three, and even the Yuan of China, which we borrowed, is currently gaining value against TL.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the current exchange rates and economic conditions of the mentioned currencies against the Turkish Lira (TL). The claim states that the following currencies are gaining value against the TL:

1. Dollar/Euro
2. Syrian Lira
3. Iranian Riyal
4. Libyan Dinar
5. Iraqi Dinar
6. Chinese Yuan

### Analysis:

1. **Dollar/Euro**: Historically, the Turkish Lira has been depreciating against both the US Dollar and the Euro. This part of the claim is generally true.

2. **Syrian Lira**: The Syrian economy has been severely impacted by the civil war, leading to a significant depreciation of the Syrian Lira. It is unlikely that the Syrian Lira is gaining value against the Turkish Lira.

3. **Iranian Riyal**: Iran has been under heavy economic sanctions, which have led to a significant depreciation of the Iranian Riyal. It is unlikely that the Iranian Riyal is gaining value against the Turkish Lira.

4. **Libyan Dinar**: Libya has been experiencing ongoing conflict, which has affected its economy. However, the Libyan Dinar has been relatively stable compared to the Turkish Lira, but it is not necessarily gaining value.

5. **Iraqi Dinar**: Iraq has faced significant economic challenges, and the Iraqi Dinar has not shown significant appreciation against the Turkish Lira.

6. **Chinese Yuan**: The Chinese Yuan has been relatively stable and has shown some appreciation against the Turkish Lira, especially given Turkey's economic challenges.

### Conclusion:

- The claim about the Dollar/Euro and Chinese Yuan gaining value against the TL is accurate.
- The claim about the Syrian Lira, Iranian Riyal, Libyan Dinar, and Iraqi Dinar gaining value against the TL is not supported by current economic data.

1. **Turkey's External Debt-to-Export Income Ratio**: The claim states that Turkey's foreign debt is $194 for every $100 of export income. This ratio can be verified through financial reports from credible sources such as the World Bank, IMF, or Turkey's own financial institutions.

2. **India's External Debt-to-Export Income Ratio**: The claim states that India's external debt is $93 for every $100 of export income. This can be checked against India's financial statistics.

3. **Mexico's External Debt-to-Export Income Ratio**: The claim states that Mexico's external debt is $92 for every $100 of export income. This can be verified through Mexico's financial data.

4. **Russia's External Debt-to-Export Income Ratio**: The claim states that Russia's external debt is $81 for every $100 of export income. This can be verified through Russia's financial data.

5. **Comparison with Argentina**: The claim states that Turkey has the highest external debt in the market economies category after Argentina. This requires a comparison of external debt-to-export income ratios across various market economies.

Without access to the most recent and specific data from authoritative financial sources, it is challenging to definitively verify each of these figures. However, based on historical data and general trends, Turkey has been known to have a high external debt-to-export income ratio, often higher than many other emerging market economies.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data verification, the claim appears to be based on a mix of accurate and potentially outdated or slightly inaccurate figures.

"Calf deaths are 15 percent in our country.About 500 thousand calves die each year.When we stop calf deaths, live animal imports will be avoided spontaneously.",mostly true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **Calf deaths are 15 percent in our country.**
   - This statement would need to be verified with national livestock statistics. If the national data supports that 15% of calves die annually, this part of the claim is accurate.

2. **About 500 thousand calves die each year.**
   - This can be cross-checked with the total number of calves born annually in the country. If the total number of calves born is around 3.33 million (since 15% of 3.33 million is approximately 500,000), this part of the claim is accurate.

3. **When we stop calf deaths, live animal imports will be avoided spontaneously.**
   - This is a more complex assertion. Reducing calf mortality could indeed increase the domestic supply of livestock, potentially reducing the need for imports. However, whether it would completely eliminate the need for imports depends on various factors such as demand, market conditions, and other logistical considerations.

Given that the first two parts of the claim can be verified with data and seem plausible, but the third part is more speculative and depends on additional factors, the overall claim is not entirely accurate but has some truth to it.

Incentives for R & D investments or the share of the share deposited there is the development of the defense industry.,half true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down:

1. **Incentives for R&D investments**: Governments and organizations often provide incentives for research and development (R&D) investments to stimulate innovation and technological advancements. This is a common practice across various industries, including the defense sector.

2. **Share of the share deposited**: This part of the statement is unclear. It could be interpreted as the portion of funds or resources allocated to R&D within the defense industry.

3. **Development of the defense industry**: The defense industry heavily relies on R&D to develop new technologies, weapons systems, and other defense-related innovations. Incentives for R&D investments can significantly contribute to the growth and advancement of the defense industry.

Given these points, the claim suggests that incentives for R&D investments contribute to the development of the defense industry. This is generally accurate, as R&D is crucial for the defense sector's progress.

"While the national income per person in the TRNC is about 10 in the past, it is a factor that should be taken into consideration.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the statement based on available data and logical consistency.

1. **National Income Per Person**: The claim states that the national income per person in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) was ""about 10 in the past."" This figure is ambiguous because it does not specify the unit of measurement (e.g., 10 thousand dollars, 10 million dollars, etc.). Without a clear unit, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of this part of the statement.

2. **Factor to be Considered**: The statement also mentions that this national income per person is a factor that should be taken into consideration. This part of the claim is more subjective and generally true, as national income per person is an important economic indicator.

Given the ambiguity of the first part of the statement and the general truth of the second part, the claim cannot be fully verified or falsified without additional context or clarification.

We are more successful than many countries in the reduction of greenhouse gas.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are more successful than many countries in the reduction of greenhouse gas,"" we need to consider several factors, including the specific country being referred to, the metrics used to measure success, and the context of the comparison.

1. **Specific Country**: The claim does not specify which country ""we"" refers to. Different countries have varying levels of success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

2. **Metrics Used**: Success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be measured in absolute terms (total reduction in emissions) or relative terms (percentage reduction relative to a baseline year). It can also be measured per capita or in terms of emissions intensity (emissions per unit of GDP).

3. **Context of Comparison**: The claim compares the unspecified country to ""many countries,"" which is a broad and somewhat vague comparison. It does not specify which countries are included in this comparison group.

Given the lack of specificity and the broad nature of the claim, it is difficult to definitively categorize it without more detailed information. However, many countries have made significant strides in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and some have been more successful than others depending on the metrics used.

**Example Analysis**:
- If ""we"" refers to a country like Germany, which has made substantial progress in reducing emissions, the claim might lean towards ""Mostly True.""
- If ""we"" refers to a country with less progress, the claim might be ""Mostly False.""

Without specific details, the claim is somewhat ambiguous but not entirely baseless, as many countries have indeed made varying levels of progress.

Azerbaijani oil makes up about 40 percent of oil consumption of some European countries,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijani oil makes up about 40 percent of oil consumption of some European countries,"" we need to look at the data on oil imports and consumption in European countries.

Azerbaijan is a significant oil producer and exporter, and it does supply oil to various European countries. However, the percentage of Azerbaijani oil in the total oil consumption of European countries varies widely. For most European countries, Azerbaijani oil does not constitute such a high percentage of their total oil consumption. Major oil suppliers to Europe include Russia, Norway, and OPEC countries, which generally have a larger share of the market.

While Azerbaijan does supply a notable amount of oil to some European countries, it is unlikely that it makes up as much as 40 percent of the total oil consumption for any significant number of these countries. Therefore, the claim seems to be an overstatement.

"When we divide it into 10 -year periods, we have the worst 10 years in unemployment.Only the number of university graduates unemployed is more than the population of 70 countries than the number known in the UN.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""When we divide it into 10-year periods, we have the worst 10 years in unemployment.""
2. ""Only the number of university graduates unemployed is more than the population of 70 countries than the number known in the UN.""

For the first part, we would need historical unemployment data to compare the last 10 years with previous decades. This requires specific data analysis, which is not provided here.

For the second part, we need to verify the number of unemployed university graduates and compare it to the populations of 70 countries. According to the United Nations, there are indeed countries with very small populations, some even less than 100,000 people. However, without specific numbers of unemployed university graduates, this claim is difficult to verify.

Given the lack of specific data and the need for detailed verification, the claim cannot be fully substantiated or refuted based on the information provided.

(In the budget allocated to education) was an increase of 726 percent compared to 2002 and increased to 62 billion.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The percentage increase in the budget allocated to education compared to 2002.
2. The final amount of the budget allocated to education, which is stated to be 62 billion.

Without specific data from 2002 and the current year in question, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate, we can analyze the statement based on the given information.

If the budget in 2002 was significantly lower and the current budget is indeed 62 billion, a 726 percent increase could be plausible. For example, if the budget in 2002 was approximately 7.5 billion, a 726 percent increase would result in a budget of around 62 billion.

"2 million girls cannot go to primary school, 4 out of 5 people who are illiterate are women.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to look at reliable data sources such as UNESCO, UNICEF, and other reputable organizations that track global education and literacy statistics.

1. **Girls' Access to Primary Education**: According to UNESCO, millions of children worldwide are out of school, and a significant portion of them are girls. However, the exact number can vary by year and source. As of recent reports, the number of girls out of primary school is often cited to be in the millions, but the specific figure of ""2 million"" may not be precise.

2. **Illiteracy Among Women**: UNESCO and other organizations have consistently reported that women make up a significant majority of the world's illiterate population. The figure ""4 out of 5"" (or 80%) is a commonly cited statistic, though it can vary slightly depending on the source and year.

Given these points:

- The claim about ""2 million girls cannot go to primary school"" is somewhat specific and may not be entirely accurate as the number can be higher or lower depending on the source and year.
- The claim that ""4 out of 5 people who are illiterate are women"" is generally supported by data, though it might be slightly exaggerated as the actual figure is often around two-thirds to three-quarters.

Considering the overall context and the general accuracy of the statements, the claim is more accurate than not but contains some potential exaggerations or specific inaccuracies.

Из за Мутаций роронавиру вакцина от оть можо мозеть нефективной,half true,az,"The claim that ""Из-за мутаций коронавируса вакцина от него может быть неэффективной"" translates to ""Due to mutations of the coronavirus, the vaccine against it may be ineffective.""

This claim is not entirely accurate. While it is true that mutations in the coronavirus can potentially affect the efficacy of vaccines, it is not correct to say that vaccines will necessarily become ineffective. Vaccines can still provide significant protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death, even if their effectiveness against infection may be somewhat reduced by certain variants. Additionally, vaccine manufacturers can update vaccines to better match circulating variants.

Türkiye ranked 69th in 186 countries with 0.779 index value and took part in the high human development class.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the Human Development Index (HDI) ranking and index value for Türkiye. The HDI is a composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living.

According to the latest Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Türkiye's HDI ranking and index value can be checked. As of the most recent report:

1. Türkiye's HDI ranking is indeed around the 69th position.
2. The HDI index value for Türkiye is approximately 0.779.
3. Türkiye is classified under the ""high human development"" category.

Given this information, the claim that ""Türkiye ranked 69th in 186 countries with 0.779 index value and took part in the high human development class"" aligns with the data provided by the UNDP.

"Hazelnut is not the product that the state is damaged, but a product that makes money.Last year we only earned $ 2 billion from exports.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Hazelnut is a product that makes money and is not damaging to the state.
2. Last year, $2 billion was earned from hazelnut exports.

### Point 1: Hazelnut as a Profitable Product
Hazelnuts are indeed a significant agricultural product for several countries, particularly Turkey, which is the world's largest producer and exporter of hazelnuts. The crop is known to be a major source of income for farmers and contributes positively to the economy.

### Point 2: Earnings from Hazelnut Exports
According to various reports and data from trade organizations, Turkey's hazelnut exports have indeed generated substantial revenue. For instance, in recent years, Turkey has consistently earned billions of dollars from hazelnut exports. The figure of $2 billion is within the range of reported earnings for a typical year.

### Conclusion
Given that hazelnuts are a profitable agricultural product and the reported earnings from exports align with the claim, the statement appears to be accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"So far, what newspaper has closed and blocked?",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""So far, what newspaper has closed and blocked?"", we need to evaluate the context and specifics of the statement. The claim is somewhat vague and lacks specific details about which newspaper is being referred to, the reasons for its closure, and what is meant by ""blocked.""

Given the lack of specific information, it is challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, newspapers do occasionally close due to financial difficulties, changes in ownership, or other reasons. Additionally, some newspapers might be blocked in certain regions due to political or regulatory reasons.

Without more precise information, the claim cannot be fully validated or refuted. Therefore, the most appropriate classification for this claim, given its vagueness and lack of detail, would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"When the AK Party came to power in 2002, the share of the national income from the national education to the budget of the Ministry of National Education was around 17.4.Now the point he came from is 4.8.The share allocated to educational investments is really falling a little further in the dormitory every year.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific figures and trends mentioned regarding the share of the national income allocated to the Ministry of National Education's budget in Turkey from 2002 to the present.

1. **Initial Share in 2002**: The claim states that the share of the national income allocated to the Ministry of National Education's budget was around 17.4% in 2002.
2. **Current Share**: The claim states that this share has decreased to 4.8% in recent years.
3. **Trend in Educational Investments**: The claim suggests that the share allocated to educational investments has been decreasing annually.

### Verification:

1. **Initial Share in 2002**:
   - According to various sources, the share of the national budget allocated to education in Turkey in 2002 was significantly lower than 17.4%. It was closer to 2.5% to 3.5% of the GDP, not the national income.

2. **Current Share**:
   - Recent data indicates that the share of the national budget allocated to education has increased over the years. As of the latest figures, it is around 4% to 6% of the GDP, depending on the specific year and source.

3. **Trend in Educational Investments**:
   - While there have been fluctuations, the overall trend has shown an increase in the budget allocated to education over the years, not a decrease.

Given these points, the claim appears to be inaccurate in its specific figures and overall trend.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False

1. The Constitution requires written question proposals to be answered within 15 days.
2. If a deputy asks a question, it must be answered within 15 days.
3. The rate of questions answered within 15 days in the 26th period is 10.99%.

Assuming the information provided is accurate and based on the context given:

1. The Constitution does indeed require written question proposals to be answered within 15 days.
2. Deputies' questions should be answered within the same 15-day timeframe.
3. The specific rate of questions answered within 15 days in the 26th period being 10.99% would need to be verified with official records.

Given that the first two points are generally accurate and the third point is a specific statistic that we assume to be correct based on the context provided:

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
The AK Party has only left behind the total number of members of many parties with its 601 thousand new members this year. ”,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The AK Party has only left behind the total number of members of many parties with its 601 thousand new members this year,"" we need to verify several key points:

1. The number of new members the AK Party has gained this year.
2. The total membership numbers of other parties.
3. Whether the 601 thousand new members surpass the total membership of many other parties.

Without specific data on the membership numbers of other parties and the exact number of new members the AK Party has gained, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the statement is based on accurate and up-to-date membership statistics, it could be plausible.

Given the lack of concrete data in the provided information, the claim appears to be an assertion that could be true if the numbers are accurate. However, without verification, it cannot be fully confirmed.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The ratio of the workplace opened in 2016 to the collection (workplace) is 14.1 percent;The closing workplace was 5.2 percent.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the information provided and verify it against reliable data sources.

1. **Ratio of workplaces opened in 2016 to the collection (workplace)**: The claim states this ratio is 14.1 percent.
2. **Closing workplace percentage**: The claim states this was 5.2 percent.

Without specific data from a reliable source such as government labor statistics or a reputable industry report, it is challenging to verify these exact percentages. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, we can analyze the logical consistency of the statement.

- The ratio of workplaces opened in 2016 to the total collection of workplaces being 14.1 percent suggests that for every 100 workplaces, approximately 14 were opened in 2016.
- The closing workplace percentage being 5.2 percent suggests that for every 100 workplaces, approximately 5 were closed.

If these percentages are based on accurate data, the claim could be considered true. However, without access to the specific data source, we cannot definitively verify the accuracy.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate classification would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Istanbul gives 50 percent of Turkey's tax, but it does not even receive 10 percent.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Istanbul gives 50 percent of Turkey's tax, but it does not even receive 10 percent,"" we need to examine the available data on tax contributions and government spending or allocations in Turkey.

1. **Tax Contribution**: Istanbul is indeed a major economic hub in Turkey and contributes a significant portion of the country's tax revenue. Various reports and data from the Turkish Ministry of Finance and other financial institutions often indicate that Istanbul contributes a substantial percentage of the national tax revenue. While the exact percentage can vary year by year, it is often cited to be around 40-50%.

2. **Government Spending/Allocation**: The claim that Istanbul does not receive even 10 percent of the tax revenue it generates is more complex. Government spending is distributed across various sectors and regions, and it is not always directly proportional to the tax revenue generated by a specific region. The allocation of government funds depends on numerous factors, including population needs, infrastructure projects, social services, and political considerations.

To verify the specific percentages, one would need to look at detailed financial reports from the Turkish government, which outline both the tax contributions by region and the distribution of government spending.

Given the general understanding that Istanbul contributes a large portion of Turkey's tax revenue and that government spending is not necessarily proportional to tax contributions, the claim has some basis but may not be entirely accurate in its specifics.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
Our Country is One of the Leading Countries in Terms of Bed Stock,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Our Country is One of the Leading Countries in Terms of Bed Stock,"" we need to consider the available data on hospital bed stock (the number of hospital beds per capita) and compare it to other countries.

Hospital bed stock is typically measured in terms of the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people. Leading countries in terms of hospital bed stock often include nations with well-developed healthcare systems and significant investments in healthcare infrastructure.

Countries like Japan, South Korea, Germany, and Russia are known to have high hospital bed stocks. For example, Japan has around 13 beds per 1,000 people, South Korea has around 12 beds per 1,000 people, and Germany has around 8 beds per 1,000 people.

If the country in question is not among these top-ranking nations or does not have a comparable number of hospital beds per capita, the claim would not be accurate.

Without specific data on the country in question, it is challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, if the country is not typically listed among those with the highest hospital bed stocks, the claim would likely be exaggerated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
Our forest assets increased by 1 and a half million hectares in the last 15 years.We have increased our tree reserve by 30 percent in 15 years.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The increase in forest assets by 1.5 million hectares over the last 15 years.
2. The increase in the tree reserve by 30 percent over the same period.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these figures, we can only assess the logical consistency and plausibility based on general knowledge.

1. **Increase in Forest Assets**: An increase of 1.5 million hectares over 15 years is a specific and measurable claim. If we assume an average annual increase, it would be 100,000 hectares per year. This is plausible but needs verification from forestry data or environmental reports.

2. **Increase in Tree Reserve**: A 30 percent increase in the tree reserve over 15 years is also a specific claim. This would mean that if the initial tree reserve was X hectares, it is now 1.3X hectares. This percentage increase is plausible but, again, requires verification from relevant data sources.

Given that both claims are specific and measurable but lack immediate verification from provided data, we can assess the overall claim as follows:

- The claims are logically consistent and plausible.
- Without specific data, we cannot fully verify the accuracy.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the logical consistency of the claims, the most appropriate assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False

"In the last 15 years in Turkey, the total debt of the households has increased by 75 times and has reached 550 billion TL today.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In the last 15 years in Turkey, the total debt of the households has increased by 75 times and has reached 550 billion TL today,"" we need to verify two key points:

1. The increase in household debt over the last 15 years.
2. The current total household debt in Turkey.

1. **Increase in Household Debt:**
   - If the household debt has increased by 75 times over the last 15 years, we need to know the initial amount of household debt 15 years ago.
   - For example, if the debt was 7.33 billion TL 15 years ago, multiplying it by 75 would result in approximately 550 billion TL.

2. **Current Total Household Debt:**
   - We need to confirm if the current household debt is indeed 550 billion TL.

Without access to specific historical and current financial data from reliable sources such as the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey or other financial institutions, it is challenging to verify these figures precisely. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, the increase by 75 times and the current debt of 550 billion TL should be consistent.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim directly, but assuming the figures are based on reliable sources, the claim appears plausible.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"In 21 provinces affected by terrorism negatively, 11 thousand 354 tradesmen in the 10 months of this year hit the door, the number of companies reached 1,549.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the specific statistics mentioned: 11,354 tradesmen and 1,549 companies affected by terrorism in 21 provinces over a 10-month period. This would require access to reliable data sources such as government reports, economic studies, or credible news articles that provide these exact figures.

Without access to these specific data sources, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided and the lack of verifiable sources, I cannot confirm the accuracy of the claim.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Drug use fell below 11.Applicants for treatment in the last 9 years have increased 19 times,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Drug use fell below 11.""
2. ""Applicants for treatment in the last 9 years have increased 19 times.""

For the first part, ""Drug use fell below 11,"" the statement is unclear and lacks context. It is not specified what ""11"" refers to—whether it is a percentage, a rate per 1,000 people, or another metric. Without this information, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of this claim.

For the second part, ""Applicants for treatment in the last 9 years have increased 19 times,"" this is a specific and measurable claim. However, without access to relevant data on the number of applicants for treatment over the past 9 years, it is not possible to verify this claim either.

Given the lack of context and data for both parts of the claim, it is not possible to determine the overall truthfulness of the statement.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
... Our country has lost 164 thousand 222 decares of forest in the twelve -year AKP period.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Our country has lost 164 thousand 222 decares of forest in the twelve-year AKP period,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The exact period referred to as the ""twelve-year AKP period.""
2. Reliable data on forest loss in the country during that period.
3. The conversion and understanding of the unit ""decare"" (1 decare = 1,000 square meters or 0.1 hectares).

Without access to specific data sources or official reports on forest loss during the specified period, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data from a reliable source, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific data verification in this context, the best we can do is to evaluate the plausibility based on general knowledge and trends in forest loss.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
The educational standards in Turkey are better than the UK or even America.,false,tr,"To evaluate the claim that ""The educational standards in Turkey are better than the UK or even America,"" we need to consider various metrics and data sources that compare educational systems across countries. These metrics often include international assessments like PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment), literacy rates, graduation rates, and higher education rankings.

1. **PISA Scores**: The PISA assessment, conducted by the OECD, evaluates 15-year-olds in reading, mathematics, and science. Historically, countries like the UK and the USA have generally scored higher than Turkey in these assessments.

2. **Higher Education Rankings**: Universities in the UK and the USA often rank higher in global university rankings (such as QS World University Rankings and Times Higher Education) compared to universities in Turkey.

3. **Literacy Rates and Graduation Rates**: The UK and the USA typically have higher literacy rates and higher secondary and tertiary education graduation rates compared to Turkey.

Given these points, the claim that ""The educational standards in Turkey are better than the UK or even America"" does not align with the available data and international assessments.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
The chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement is a manifestation of high confidence of our successful foreign policy and members of the movement to our country,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the context and implications of the chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).

1. **Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)**: NAM is a group of states that are not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc. It was established in 1961 during the Cold War to ensure the national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of non-aligned countries.

2. **Chairmanship**: The chairmanship of NAM rotates among member countries and is typically held for a period of three years. The chair is usually decided by consensus among member states.

3. **Implications of Chairmanship**:
   - **Diplomatic Recognition**: Being elected as the chair of NAM can be seen as a recognition of a country's diplomatic efforts and its standing within the movement.
   - **Foreign Policy**: It can also reflect the confidence of other member states in the country's ability to lead and represent the movement's interests on the global stage.

Given these points, the claim that the chairmanship is a manifestation of high confidence in the country's successful foreign policy and the trust of NAM members is generally accurate. However, it is important to note that the chairmanship is also influenced by rotational and regional considerations, and not solely by the country's foreign policy success.

There are 800 thousand subcontractors working in the public sector.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There are 800 thousand subcontractors working in the public sector,"" we need to consider the available data and context. 

1. **Data Availability**: The number of subcontractors in the public sector can vary significantly by country, region, and the specific definition of ""subcontractor"" and ""public sector."" 

2. **Verification**: Without specific data or a reliable source to verify this number, it is challenging to confirm the exact figure. 

3. **Context**: If the claim is referring to a specific country or region, it would be necessary to have data from government reports, labor statistics, or other authoritative sources to verify the number.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the general nature of the claim and the absence of specific evidence, it would be prudent to approach it with skepticism.

"Let's look at the developed countries, we see that there is almost a presidential system.",false,tr,"To evaluate the claim that ""in developed countries, there is almost a presidential system,"" we need to consider the political systems of developed countries.

Developed countries, often referred to as high-income or advanced economies, include nations such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, Australia, and many others. These countries have a variety of political systems:

1. **Presidential Systems**: In a presidential system, the president is the head of state and government, and there is a clear separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches. The United States is a prime example of a presidential system.

2. **Parliamentary Systems**: In a parliamentary system, the head of government (usually a prime minister) is distinct from the head of state (often a monarch or ceremonial president). The executive branch derives its legitimacy from the legislature and is accountable to it. Examples include the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Australia, and Japan.

3. **Semi-Presidential Systems**: In a semi-presidential system, there is both a president and a prime minister, and the executive powers are shared between them. France is an example of a semi-presidential system.

Given this diversity, it is clear that not all developed countries have a presidential system. Many have parliamentary or semi-presidential systems.

"In the AKP, he considered it in the agricultural production place;It has even declined in some products.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the context and data regarding agricultural production under the AKP (Justice and Development Party) in Turkey. The AKP has been in power since 2002, and during this period, Turkey has seen various changes in its agricultural sector.

1. **Agricultural Production Place**: The claim suggests that the AKP considered agriculture important. This is generally true as the AKP has implemented various policies to support agriculture, including subsidies, modernization efforts, and rural development programs.

2. **Decline in Some Products**: This part of the claim is also important to verify. While the AKP has made efforts to boost agricultural production, there have been reports and data indicating that production of certain agricultural products has declined. For example, Turkey has seen a decrease in the production of some staple crops like wheat and sugar beets in certain years, due to factors such as climate change, urbanization, and changes in agricultural policy.

Given these points, the claim that the AKP considered agriculture important but has seen a decline in some products is supported by evidence.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
Positive dynamics in gas production is resistant,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Positive dynamics in gas production is resistant,"" we need to break down the components of the statement and evaluate them.

1. **Positive Dynamics in Gas Production**: This implies that gas production is increasing or improving over time. Whether this is true depends on the specific context, such as the region, time period, and external factors affecting gas production.

2. **Resistant**: This term suggests that the positive dynamics are not easily affected by external factors, such as economic downturns, regulatory changes, or market fluctuations.

Given the complexity of gas production, which can be influenced by a variety of factors including technological advancements, geopolitical events, market demand, and environmental regulations, it is challenging to assert that positive dynamics in gas production are universally resistant. In some cases, gas production may indeed show resilience, but in others, it may be highly susceptible to external influences.

Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization and does not hold true in all contexts.

Baby foods were 100 percent and rash creams were increased by 70 percent.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Baby foods were 100 percent and rash creams were increased by 70 percent,"" we need to understand the context and the specific metrics being referred to. The claim is ambiguous as it does not specify what ""100 percent"" and ""increased by 70 percent"" refer to. 

1. If ""Baby foods were 100 percent"" means that baby foods were completely available or in stock, it could be true, but this is not a common way to express availability.
2. If ""Baby foods were 100 percent"" means that the prices of baby foods increased by 100 percent, it would need verification from a reliable source.
3. ""Rash creams were increased by 70 percent"" likely refers to a price increase, but again, this needs verification from a reliable source.

Without additional context or verification from reliable sources, the claim is too vague and lacks sufficient information to be accurately assessed.

1. **Media Environment in Azerbaijan**: Azerbaijan has been criticized for its media environment, with reports from organizations like Reporters Without Borders and Freedom House indicating that the country has issues with press freedom. The government has been known to exert control over media outlets, and there have been instances of journalists and media organizations facing pressure and censorship.

2. **Pressure on Lawyers**: There have been documented cases where lawyers in Azerbaijan have faced pressure and harassment, particularly those involved in human rights cases or those representing opposition figures. International human rights organizations have reported on these issues, suggesting that there is some basis for the claim.

3. **False and Fabricated Information**: The claim specifically mentions ""false and fabrication information"" being spread in the media. While there is evidence of government influence over media and pressure on lawyers, the extent to which false information is systematically spread by government order is harder to verify without specific examples and evidence.

Given the context and available information, the claim has elements of truth but may be overstated without concrete evidence of systematic fabrication by government order.

1. The initial amount of debt per capita (11,970 lira).
2. The final amount of debt per capita (21,800 lira).
3. The time period over which this change occurred.
4. The context of the Presidential Government System and whether these figures align with official data.

Without access to specific and verified data sources, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume the figures provided are accurate and reflect official statistics, the claim would be considered 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies or lack of context, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the figures are significantly off or misrepresented, it would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific data verification in this context, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure and specificity of the numbers provided, it seems plausible.

There was a 2.5 percent decline in tourism in Turkey.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""There was a 2.5 percent decline in tourism in Turkey,"" we would need to verify the specific data on tourism statistics in Turkey for the relevant time period. This would involve checking official tourism reports, government statistics, or credible news sources that provide information on tourism trends in Turkey.

Without access to the specific data or sources, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and recent data, it could be considered 'True'. If the data is somewhat accurate but not precise, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the claim is partially correct but lacks context or is somewhat misleading, it could be 'Half True'. If the claim is largely incorrect but has a small element of truth, it might be 'Mostly False'. If the claim is entirely incorrect, it would be 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, I can guide you on how to verify it:

1. Check the latest tourism statistics from Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
2. Look for recent reports or articles from reputable news sources that discuss tourism trends in Turkey.
3. Compare the data from different sources to see if there is a consensus on the percentage change in tourism.

The share of nuclear energy in the US will increase.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The share of nuclear energy in the US will increase,"" we need to consider current trends, policies, and projections related to nuclear energy in the United States.

1. **Current Trends**: As of recent years, the share of nuclear energy in the US has been relatively stable, contributing about 20% of the total electricity generation. However, some older nuclear plants are being retired, which could potentially decrease the share if not replaced or if new plants are not built.

2. **Policies and Projections**: The US government and various states have shown interest in maintaining or increasing the share of nuclear energy as part of their clean energy goals. For instance, there are initiatives to extend the life of existing nuclear plants, invest in new technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs), and provide financial support for nuclear energy development.

3. **Market Dynamics**: The competitiveness of nuclear energy compared to other energy sources like natural gas, wind, and solar also plays a role. While nuclear energy is a low-carbon source, its high upfront costs and long development times can be a barrier.

4. **Expert Projections**: Various energy outlook reports, such as those from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), often provide projections on the future energy mix. These reports suggest that while there may be some growth in nuclear capacity due to new technologies and policy support, the overall share of nuclear energy might not see a significant increase due to the rapid growth of renewable energy sources.

"The unemployment rate of seasonality, which was free of 10.9 percent in June, increased to the top 70 months.",true,tr,"The claim ""The unemployment rate of seasonality, which was free of 10.9 percent in June, increased to the top 70 months"" is confusing and appears to contain several inaccuracies and unclear statements. 

1. ""The unemployment rate of seasonality"" is not a standard term. Typically, unemployment rates are adjusted for seasonality, but the phrase itself is not used.
2. ""Free of 10.9 percent in June"" is unclear. It might mean the unemployment rate was 10.9 percent in June, but the wording is ambiguous.
3. ""Increased to the top 70 months"" is also unclear. It is not standard to describe unemployment rates in terms of ""top 70 months.""

Given these points, the claim is not coherent and does not align with standard economic reporting or terminology.

"In 14 years, we put 18 thousand 500 kilometers of road 6 thousand 100 kilometers.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the statement: ""In 14 years, we put 18 thousand 500 kilometers of road 6 thousand 100 kilometers.""

The statement appears to be confusing and possibly contains a typographical or logical error. It seems to be trying to convey information about road construction over a period of 14 years, but the numbers and phrasing are unclear. 

If we interpret the statement as saying that 18,500 kilometers of road were constructed over 14 years, that would be a clear and understandable claim. However, the inclusion of ""6 thousand 100 kilometers"" without context makes the statement ambiguous.

Given the ambiguity and lack of clarity in the statement, it is difficult to verify its accuracy or meaning.

16 -year AK Party in the rule of 2 trillion dollars tax collected.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the AK Party collected 2 trillion dollars in taxes over 16 years, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Tax Revenue Data**: We need to look at the official tax revenue data for Turkey during the AK Party's rule.
2. **Currency Exchange Rates**: Since the claim is in dollars, we need to account for the exchange rates over the 16-year period.
3. **Economic Context**: Understanding the economic conditions and tax policies during this period can provide context for the numbers.

The AK Party (Justice and Development Party) has been in power in Turkey since 2002. If we consider the period from 2002 to 2018 (16 years), we can look at the total tax revenue collected by the Turkish government during this time.

According to available data, Turkey's annual tax revenue has varied significantly, but for simplicity, let's assume an average annual tax revenue of around $125 billion (this is a rough estimate and would need precise data for exact calculations). Over 16 years, this would amount to approximately $2 trillion.

However, this is a simplified calculation and the actual figure could be influenced by various factors such as economic growth, inflation, changes in tax policy, and fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Turkish Lira and the US Dollar.

Given the rough estimate aligns with the claim, but acknowledging the need for precise data for a definitive conclusion:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Inflation rates in authoritarian regimes are almost 20 times 20 times in democracies.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Inflation rates in authoritarian regimes are almost 20 times 20 times in democracies,"" we need to examine empirical data and research on inflation rates in different types of political regimes.

1. **Empirical Data**: Studies and data from sources like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and academic research often compare economic indicators across different political systems. While it is generally observed that authoritarian regimes can experience higher inflation rates due to less economic stability, lack of checks and balances, and potential for mismanagement, the claim that inflation rates are ""almost 20 times"" those in democracies is an extreme assertion.

2. **Research Findings**: Research does indicate that democracies tend to have more stable economic policies and lower inflation rates compared to authoritarian regimes. However, the magnitude of the difference is not typically as large as ""20 times."" For example, a study might show that inflation rates in authoritarian regimes are higher, but not to the extent of being 20 times higher.

3. **Contextual Factors**: Inflation rates are influenced by a variety of factors including economic policies, global economic conditions, and specific country circumstances. While political regime type is a significant factor, it is not the sole determinant of inflation rates.

Given the exaggerated nature of the claim and the lack of supporting evidence for such a specific and extreme difference, the claim appears to be an overstatement.

"With the women's policies supported by the current power, the number of women limited to the house exceeded 4 million.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate several factors:

1. **Source of the Claim**: The credibility of the source making the claim is crucial. Is it a reputable organization, a government report, or an independent study?

2. **Data and Evidence**: Are there statistics or studies that support the claim that women's policies have led to over 4 million women being limited to the house? This would involve looking at labor force participation rates, employment statistics, and any relevant policy changes.

3. **Context of Policies**: Understanding the specific policies in question and their intended and actual impacts on women's roles in society and the workforce.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the situation before and after the implementation of these policies to see if there is a significant change that aligns with the claim.

Without specific data or evidence provided in the claim, it is challenging to verify its accuracy. However, based on the general approach to such claims, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific evidence and context provided in the claim, it is difficult to definitively categorize it as 'True' or 'False'. Therefore, the most appropriate categorization based on the information provided would be:

"267,000 hectares of grapes were brutally destroyed during the power of the Popular Musavat Couple",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""267,000 hectares of grapes were brutally destroyed during the power of the Popular Musavat Couple,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: The Popular Musavat Couple likely refers to a specific period or leadership in a particular region. The Musavat Party is a historical political party in Azerbaijan, but there is no widely known reference to a ""Popular Musavat Couple"" in historical records.

2. **Verification of the Event**: There should be historical or agricultural records indicating that such a large-scale destruction of grapevines occurred. This would typically be documented in news reports, government records, or historical accounts.

3. **Scale of Destruction**: 267,000 hectares is an extremely large area (approximately 660,000 acres). Such a significant event would likely be well-documented and widely reported.

Given the lack of specific historical references to a ""Popular Musavat Couple"" and the absence of widely known events involving the destruction of such a vast area of grapevines, the claim appears to be dubious.

Those who wanted to be sent to the Supreme Court often did not speak,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Those who wanted to be sent to the Supreme Court often did not speak,"" we need to consider the context and typical behavior of individuals seeking appointment to the Supreme Court.

1. **Nomination Process**: Individuals do not ""send themselves"" to the Supreme Court. They are nominated by the President and must be confirmed by the Senate.
2. **Public Statements**: Nominees often undergo intense scrutiny, including public hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. During these hearings, nominees typically do speak, answering questions about their judicial philosophy, past rulings, and other relevant matters.
3. **Strategic Silence**: While nominees might avoid making controversial statements or taking strong stances on specific issues to avoid jeopardizing their confirmation, this does not equate to not speaking at all.

Given these points, the claim that ""Those who wanted to be sent to the Supreme Court often did not speak"" is misleading. Nominees do speak during the confirmation process, although they may be cautious in their responses.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"You are looking at the growth rate, we are currently the best point in the world.You are looking at the scales of IMF, OECD, we are in the best position.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the current growth rates and positions of various countries according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

1. **IMF Data**: The IMF regularly publishes World Economic Outlook reports that include growth rate projections for different countries. As of the latest available data, the growth rates of countries can be compared to see which country is experiencing the highest growth.

2. **OECD Data**: The OECD also publishes economic outlooks and growth projections for its member countries. This data can be used to compare the growth rates of OECD countries.

To verify the claim, we would need to check the most recent reports from both the IMF and the OECD to see if the country in question is indeed at the top in terms of growth rate.

Given that the claim states ""we are currently the best point in the world"" and ""we are in the best position,"" it implies that the country is leading globally in growth rate according to both the IMF and OECD.

Without specific data from the latest reports, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, it is generally unlikely for a single country to be the top performer in growth rate across both IMF and OECD scales simultaneously, as these organizations cover a wide range of countries with varying economic conditions.

**Based on general knowledge and the need for specific data verification:**

Final Answer: 'Mostly False'",mostly false,False,False
The growth in the non-oil sector has exceeded GDP growth,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The growth in the non-oil sector has exceeded GDP growth,"" we need to compare the growth rates of the non-oil sector and the overall GDP. This requires specific data on the growth rates of both the non-oil sector and the overall GDP for the relevant time period.

If the non-oil sector's growth rate is higher than the overall GDP growth rate, the claim would be true. Conversely, if the non-oil sector's growth rate is lower or equal to the overall GDP growth rate, the claim would be false.

Without specific data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the statement is based on recent trends or reports that indicate the non-oil sector is indeed growing faster than the overall GDP, we could consider it as 'Mostly True' or 'True'.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I will base my response on the assumption that the claim is made with some basis in recent economic reports or trends.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
The unionization in Turkey has landed to the lowest level of history ...,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The unionization in Turkey has landed to the lowest level of history,"" we need to examine the historical and current data on unionization rates in Turkey.

1. **Historical Context**: Unionization rates in Turkey have fluctuated over the decades due to various political, economic, and social factors. Historically, Turkey has seen higher unionization rates during certain periods, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s.

2. **Current Data**: According to recent reports and statistics, unionization rates in Turkey have indeed been declining. For instance, data from the Turkish Statistical Institute and other labor organizations indicate a significant drop in union membership over the past few years.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: To assert that unionization is at its ""lowest level of history,"" we would need to compare current rates with the lowest historical rates. If current rates are indeed the lowest ever recorded, the claim would be true.

Based on available data, it appears that unionization rates in Turkey are at or near historically low levels, but without precise historical data for every year, it is challenging to definitively state that it is the absolute lowest in history.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
"... Women do the same job as men, but they get 20 percent missing fees.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Women do the same job as men, but they get 20 percent missing fees,"" we need to consider the context and available data on gender pay disparities.

1. **Gender Pay Gap**: The gender pay gap is a well-documented phenomenon where women, on average, earn less than men. According to data from sources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and other studies, women typically earn about 80-85% of what men earn, which translates to a pay gap of approximately 15-20%.

2. **Same Job Comparison**: The claim specifies that women do the ""same job"" as men. When controlling for the same job, experience, education, and other factors, the pay gap tends to be smaller but still exists. Studies have shown that even when comparing men and women in the same roles with similar qualifications, women often earn less, though the gap may be narrower than the overall average.

3. **20 Percent Figure**: The 20 percent figure is a reasonable approximation of the overall gender pay gap, though it can vary by industry, occupation, and other factors. Some reports suggest the gap is slightly less, while others indicate it can be more significant in certain sectors.

Given this information, the claim that women earn 20 percent less than men for the same job is somewhat supported by data, though it may not be universally accurate in every context.

"Over the past 25 years, the country's gross domestic product has increased 216 times",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that a country's gross domestic product (GDP) has increased 216 times over the past 25 years, we need to consider historical GDP data and typical economic growth rates.

A 216-fold increase in GDP over 25 years implies an extraordinarily high average annual growth rate. To illustrate, let's calculate the required average annual growth rate using the formula for compound annual growth rate (CAGR):

\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \]

Where:
- Ending Value = 216
- Beginning Value = 1
- n = 25 years

\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( 216 \right)^{\frac{1}{25}} - 1 \]

Using a calculator:

\[ \text{CAGR} = \left( 216 \right)^{0.04} - 1 \approx 0.259 \text{ or } 25.9\% \]

An average annual growth rate of 25.9% over 25 years is extremely high and unprecedented for any large economy. Most countries experience GDP growth rates in the range of 2-10% per year, with higher rates typically seen in rapidly developing economies but not sustained over such a long period.

Given this context, the claim that a country's GDP has increased 216 times over 25 years is highly unlikely and not supported by typical economic data.

1 million 600 thousand people are a stable salary in Azerbaijan,mostly true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""1 million 600 thousand people are a stable salary in Azerbaijan,"" we need to break down the statement and verify its components.

1. **Population and Workforce**: Azerbaijan has a population of approximately 10 million people. The workforce (employed population) is a subset of this total population.

2. **Stable Salary**: The term ""stable salary"" is somewhat ambiguous but generally refers to consistent and reliable income from employment.

3. **Employment Statistics**: According to various sources, the number of employed people in Azerbaijan is around 5 million. However, not all of these individuals may have what is considered a ""stable salary.""

Given these points, the claim that 1.6 million people have a stable salary in Azerbaijan could be plausible, but it is difficult to verify without more specific data on what constitutes a ""stable salary"" and the exact number of people earning such salaries.

Erdogan's mass citizenship to Syrians has no wife in the modern world.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Erdogan's mass citizenship to Syrians has no wife in the modern world,"" we need to break down the statement and analyze its components.

1. **Mass Citizenship to Syrians**: It is true that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has granted citizenship to a significant number of Syrian refugees. This policy has been part of Turkey's response to the Syrian civil war, which has led to millions of Syrians seeking refuge in Turkey.

2. **""No Wife in the Modern World""**: This phrase appears to be a typographical error or a mistranslation. The intended phrase might be ""no parallel in the modern world"" or ""unprecedented in the modern world."" If we interpret it as ""unprecedented,"" we need to consider whether other countries have granted mass citizenship to refugees in recent history.

Several countries have granted citizenship to large numbers of refugees or immigrants, though the scale and context may vary. For example, Germany has granted citizenship to many refugees from various countries, and the United States has a history of granting citizenship to large numbers of immigrants.

Given these points, the claim that Erdogan's policy is unprecedented or has ""no parallel"" in the modern world is an exaggeration. While it is significant, it is not entirely without precedent.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
We have become a country with the lowest confidence index in recent years.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have become a country with the lowest confidence index in recent years,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of Confidence Index**: The term ""confidence index"" can refer to various types of confidence, such as consumer confidence, business confidence, or political confidence. Each of these indices is measured differently and by different organizations.

2. **Comparative Data**: To assert that a country has the ""lowest"" confidence index, we need comparative data from multiple countries over recent years. This data is typically collected and published by organizations like the OECD, World Bank, or specific national statistics agencies.

3. **Recent Trends**: The claim specifies ""recent years,"" so we need to look at data from the past few years to see if there has been a significant decline in the confidence index for the country in question.

Without specific data and context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is about a well-documented index like consumer confidence and there is no widely recognized report indicating that a specific country has the lowest index, the claim would likely be exaggerated.

Given the lack of specific data and context in the claim, and assuming no major reports support the assertion, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Türkiye is the country that hosts the most refugees in the world.We became the country that provides the most human development aid in the world compared to national income.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. **Türkiye hosting the most refugees in the world:**
   According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Türkiye has been hosting the largest number of refugees globally for several years, primarily due to the influx of Syrian refugees. As of recent reports, Türkiye continues to host the highest number of refugees.

2. **Türkiye providing the most human development aid in the world compared to national income:**
   The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) tracks official development assistance (ODA) and often reports on the contributions of countries relative to their gross national income (GNI). Türkiye has been recognized for its significant humanitarian aid contributions, particularly in relation to its national income. Reports from the OECD and other international bodies have highlighted Türkiye's substantial aid efforts, especially in the context of its national income.

Given the available data and reports from reputable international organizations, the claim appears to be well-supported.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
We have increased the minimum wage about 9 times in 15 years and never reduced it to inflation.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have increased the minimum wage about 9 times in 15 years and never reduced it to inflation,"" we need to examine historical data on minimum wage adjustments and their relationship to inflation.

1. **Frequency of Increases**: 
   - The claim states that the minimum wage has been increased about 9 times in 15 years. This can be verified by looking at the legislative history of minimum wage changes over the specified period.

2. **Adjustment for Inflation**:
   - The claim also states that the minimum wage has never been reduced to account for inflation. This implies that the minimum wage has not been adjusted downward to reflect changes in the cost of living.

### Analysis:

- **Historical Data**: 
  - If we look at the federal minimum wage in the United States, for example, it was last increased in 2009. Prior to that, there were increases in 2007 and 2008. However, the frequency of increases can vary by state, as some states have their own minimum wage laws that may have been adjusted more frequently.

- **Inflation Adjustment**:
  - Typically, minimum wage laws do not include provisions for reducing the wage based on deflation or negative inflation. Instead, they are more commonly adjusted upwards to keep pace with inflation or cost of living increases.

### Conclusion:

- If the context is the federal minimum wage in the United States, the claim that it has been increased about 9 times in 15 years is not accurate. However, if considering state-level adjustments, some states may have increased their minimum wage more frequently.
- The part of the claim stating that the minimum wage has never been reduced to account for inflation is generally accurate, as minimum wages are rarely, if ever, decreased.

Given these points, the claim is a mix of accurate and inaccurate elements.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"When the AK Party came to power, we were buying 85 liters of gasoline for 50 TL, now we get 7 liters of gasoline.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to look at historical data on gasoline prices and the value of the Turkish Lira (TL) over time.

1. **Historical Gasoline Prices**: When the AK Party came to power in Turkey in 2002, the price of gasoline was significantly lower than it is today. However, exact historical prices can vary based on sources and specific dates.

2. **Current Gasoline Prices**: As of recent years, gasoline prices in Turkey have increased due to various factors including inflation, global oil prices, and currency devaluation.

3. **Currency Value**: The value of the Turkish Lira has depreciated significantly over the years. This means that the purchasing power of 50 TL has decreased.

4. **Calculation**:
   - If 50 TL bought 85 liters of gasoline when the AK Party came to power, the price per liter would have been approximately 0.59 TL per liter.
   - If 50 TL now buys 7 liters of gasoline, the price per liter would be approximately 7.14 TL per liter.

Given the significant increase in gasoline prices and the depreciation of the Turkish Lira, the claim that 50 TL now buys significantly less gasoline than it did when the AK Party came to power is largely accurate. However, the exact figures might not be perfectly precise without specific historical data.

**Final Answer: Mostly True**",mostly true,False,False
We have been one of the 20 largest economies in the world since 1999.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have been one of the 20 largest economies in the world since 1999,"" we need to consider historical data on global economies. The ranking of the largest economies is typically based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures, which are compiled and published by various international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.

If the country in question has consistently been listed among the top 20 economies by GDP from 1999 to the present, the claim would be true. However, if there have been years where the country fell out of the top 20, the claim would be less accurate.

Given the general stability of the largest economies over the past few decades, it is likely that a country making this claim has indeed maintained a position within the top 20. However, without specific data to confirm this for every year since 1999, we should consider the possibility of minor fluctuations.

If there are no reports or evidence suggesting that journalists created obstacles, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor instances that could be considered obstacles but are not significant, the claim might be 'Mostly True'. If there is a mix of evidence, with some reports indicating obstacles and others not, the claim could be 'Half True'. If there are significant reports of obstacles created by journalists, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

"Approximately 10 people commit suicide every day in Turkey.The psychology of the people has deteriorated.If the imam committed suicide in this period, what does the congregation do not do?",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. **The statistical claim about suicide rates in Turkey:**
   - The claim states that approximately 10 people commit suicide every day in Turkey. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK), the number of suicides in Turkey has varied over the years. For instance, in 2019, there were 3,406 reported suicides, which averages to about 9.3 suicides per day. This figure is close to the claim of 10 suicides per day, suggesting that the claim is reasonably accurate.

2. **The psychological and societal implications:**
   - The claim suggests that the psychology of the people has deteriorated and uses a hypothetical scenario where an imam (a religious leader) commits suicide to illustrate the severity of the situation. This part of the claim is more subjective and interpretative. It reflects a concern about societal mental health but is not a verifiable fact in the same way as the statistical claim.

Given that the statistical part of the claim is close to accurate and the psychological implication is a subjective interpretation, the overall claim can be considered as having a significant degree of truth but also includes subjective elements.

The claim states that the average growth of the world is 4.7 percent and the average growth of Islamic society is 3.6 percent.

1. **World Growth Rate**: The term ""average growth"" can refer to various metrics such as economic growth (GDP growth rate), population growth, or other indicators. As of recent data, the global economic growth rate has varied significantly, especially due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, the global GDP growth rate was around 2.9% in 2019, contracted in 2020, and rebounded in 2021. A 4.7% average growth rate for the world seems unusually high for economic growth but could be plausible for certain years or specific contexts.

2. **Islamic Society Growth Rate**: Similarly, the growth rate of ""Islamic society"" could refer to economic growth in predominantly Muslim countries or population growth among Muslims. The population growth rate among Muslims has been higher than the global average due to higher fertility rates in many Muslim-majority countries. However, a specific 3.6% growth rate would need to be verified against reliable demographic or economic data.

Given the lack of specific context and the need for precise data to confirm these figures, the claim appears to be ambiguous and potentially misleading without further clarification.

2. **Context and Details**: Understand the context in which the appeals were made. Are these appeals recent, within a specific timeframe, or related to a particular event?
3. **Consistency**: Compare this claim with other reports or data from reliable sources to see if the number is consistent.

Without access to specific data or official reports, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible source or official statement, we might lean towards it being accurate.

This involves checking reliable sources such as government financial reports, international financial institutions, or reputable economic databases.

1. **Foreign Debt Per Capita in 2002**: 
   - According to historical economic data, the foreign debt per capita in 2002 was approximately 963 dollars. This figure can be cross-verified with data from sources like the World Bank or International Monetary Fund (IMF).

2. **Foreign Debt Per Capita Today**:
   - The current foreign debt per capita figure of 5,224 dollars needs to be verified with the most recent data available from similar reliable sources.

If both figures are accurate and can be substantiated by credible data, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies but the overall trend is correct, it might be 'Mostly True'. Significant inaccuracies would lead to a 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' rating depending on the extent of the error.

1. 14% of the EU average
2. 11.2% of the OECD average
3. 10.4% of South Korea
4. 7.2% of Mexico
5. More than 25% youth unemployment rate

Without context or specific data sources, it's challenging to verify these percentages accurately. However, if we assume these figures are related to a specific economic indicator (e.g., GDP, education spending, etc.), we would need to cross-reference them with reliable data from the EU, OECD, South Korea, and Mexico.

Given the lack of context and specific data verification, it's difficult to ascertain the exact truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, the best assessment we can provide is that the claim is partially verifiable but lacks sufficient context for a definitive judgment.

Ilham Aliyev said the first COVID-19 Foundation was established in Azerbaijan,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Ilham Aliyev said the first COVID-19 Foundation was established in Azerbaijan,"" we need to consider the context and available evidence.

1. **Context**: Ilham Aliyev is the President of Azerbaijan. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries established various funds and foundations to combat the virus and support affected populations.

2. **Verification**: 
   - Azerbaijan did establish a COVID-19 Response Fund in March 2020 to support the fight against the pandemic.
   - However, many other countries and organizations also established similar funds around the same time or even earlier. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund in March 2020, and other countries like the United States and European nations had their own initiatives.

Given that multiple COVID-19 funds were established globally around the same time, it is unlikely that Azerbaijan's fund was the very first. Therefore, the claim that it was the ""first"" is not accurate.

"(Syrian aid) costs about $ 5 billion in 4 years.European countries, Western countries, Islamic countries, international organizations, all of them contribute to $ 245 million.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The total cost of Syrian aid over 4 years is approximately $5 billion.
2. The contribution from European countries, Western countries, Islamic countries, and international organizations is $245 million.

Given the complexity and variability of international aid, it is essential to cross-check these figures with reliable sources such as reports from the United Nations, international aid organizations, and government publications.

1. **Total Cost of Syrian Aid**: According to various reports, the cost of humanitarian aid for Syria has been substantial. For instance, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other organizations have reported multi-billion dollar appeals for Syrian aid over several years. The figure of $5 billion over 4 years is plausible but would need specific confirmation from detailed reports.

2. **Contributions from Various Entities**: The claim that all contributions amount to $245 million seems significantly low. Historically, contributions from international donors, including European countries, Western countries, Islamic countries, and international organizations, have been in the billions. For example, the European Union alone has pledged billions in aid for Syria over multiple years.

Given the discrepancy between the claimed contributions and the known pledges and donations, the claim appears to be inaccurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The Ombudsman Institution has a great role in protecting the rights of Azerbaijani citizens,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The Ombudsman Institution has a great role in protecting the rights of Azerbaijani citizens,"" we need to consider the functions and effectiveness of the Ombudsman Institution in Azerbaijan.

1. **Role and Function**: The Ombudsman Institution in Azerbaijan is designed to protect human rights and freedoms by addressing complaints from citizens about violations by state bodies, local self-government bodies, and officials. It is intended to be an independent body that can investigate complaints and make recommendations.

2. **Effectiveness and Impact**: The effectiveness of the Ombudsman Institution can vary. While it has the mandate to protect citizens' rights, its actual impact depends on factors such as its independence, resources, and the political environment. In some cases, the institution may face limitations in its ability to enforce recommendations or may be influenced by political pressures.

3. **Reports and Assessments**: Various international organizations, such as the United Nations and the Council of Europe, have assessed the role of the Ombudsman in Azerbaijan. These assessments often highlight both the positive aspects of the institution's work and the challenges it faces, including issues related to independence and the implementation of its recommendations.

Given these considerations, the claim that the Ombudsman Institution has a ""great role"" in protecting the rights of Azerbaijani citizens can be seen as somewhat optimistic but not entirely unfounded. The institution does play a role, but its effectiveness can be limited by various factors.

Khalid Bagirov did not exceed the boundaries of freedom of expression,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Khalid Bagirov did not exceed the boundaries of freedom of expression,"" we need to consider the context and any relevant information about Khalid Bagirov's actions and statements.

Khalid Bagirov is a well-known human rights lawyer from Azerbaijan who has faced legal challenges and disbarment, often in connection with his outspoken criticism of the government and his defense of political activists. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled in favor of Bagirov in some cases, indicating that his actions were within the boundaries of freedom of expression as protected by international human rights standards.

Given this context, the claim that ""Khalid Bagirov did not exceed the boundaries of freedom of expression"" aligns with the ECHR's rulings and the general understanding of his activities as a human rights lawyer.

We have received the refugee in Europe in the last 4 years.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have received the refugee in Europe in the last 4 years,"" we need to consider the context and the data on refugee arrivals in Europe over the past four years.

1. **Refugee Arrivals in Europe**: Europe has indeed received refugees over the past four years. According to data from organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there have been significant numbers of refugees arriving in Europe due to various conflicts and crises around the world.

2. **Time Frame**: The claim specifies ""the last 4 years,"" which would cover the period from 2019 to 2023. During this time, Europe has continued to receive refugees, although the numbers may have fluctuated due to various factors, including changes in migration policies, the COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing conflicts.

3. **Generalization**: The claim is somewhat vague and general, as it does not specify the number of refugees or the specific countries in Europe that have received them. However, the overall statement that Europe has received refugees in the last four years is accurate.

Given this information, the claim is broadly accurate but lacks specific details.

Let us know where you used them for the choice,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The specific entity or context in which the 747 million implicit allowances were used.
2. The time frame of the first four months of 2018.
3. The definition and application of ""implicit allowances"" in the given context.

Without additional context or verification from a reliable source, it is challenging to ascertain the truthfulness of the claim. However, based on the information provided, there is no clear evidence to support or refute the claim.

Turkey is one of the leading countries in the world.,true,tr,"To evaluate the claim ""Turkey is one of the leading countries in the world,"" we need to consider various aspects such as economic performance, geopolitical influence, cultural impact, and other relevant factors.

1. **Economic Performance**: Turkey has a significant economy, being one of the largest in the world by GDP. It is a member of the G20, which includes the world's largest economies.

2. **Geopolitical Influence**: Turkey has a strategic location, bridging Europe and Asia, and plays a crucial role in regional politics. It is a member of NATO and has considerable influence in Middle Eastern affairs.

3. **Cultural Impact**: Turkey has a rich cultural heritage and history, contributing significantly to global culture, particularly through its historical sites, cuisine, and arts.

4. **Challenges**: Despite these strengths, Turkey faces several challenges, including political instability, economic fluctuations, and human rights issues, which can affect its standing as a ""leading country.""

Given these points, Turkey is influential and significant in several areas but may not be considered a leading country in all respects compared to global superpowers like the United States, China, or the European Union.

"There are 196 countries in the UN, but the fate of all of them is at the mouth of 5 countries, and 5 of these 5 permanent members are Christians.",false,tr,"The claim contains several elements that need to be evaluated for accuracy:

1. ""There are 196 countries in the UN"": This is incorrect. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, there are 193 member states in the United Nations.

2. ""The fate of all of them is at the mouth of 5 countries"": This likely refers to the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which are the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China. These countries do have significant influence due to their veto power.

3. ""5 of these 5 permanent members are Christians"": This is incorrect. The five permanent members of the UNSC are diverse in terms of religion. The United States, the United Kingdom, and France are predominantly Christian countries. However, Russia, while having a significant Christian population (primarily Russian Orthodox), is a multi-religious country. China is officially atheist with a mix of religious practices including Buddhism, Taoism, and others.

Given these points, the claim is not accurate in several respects.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"Despite the coup attempt ... Let us decrease our foreign exchange reserves, it increased over 125 billion dollars.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether there was a coup attempt.
2. Whether the foreign exchange reserves increased to over 125 billion dollars despite the coup attempt.

First, let's address the coup attempt. If we are referring to a specific country, such as Turkey, there was indeed a coup attempt in July 2016.

Second, we need to check the foreign exchange reserves data. For Turkey, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) provides data on foreign exchange reserves. According to CBRT data, the foreign exchange reserves have fluctuated over the years. As of the latest available data, the reserves have not consistently stayed above 125 billion dollars, especially considering the economic challenges and fluctuations in the exchange rate.

Given these points, the claim that the foreign exchange reserves increased to over 125 billion dollars despite the coup attempt is not fully accurate based on the latest data.

"In March last year, non -interest balance gave a deficit of 655 million pounds, while this year's non -interest balance gave more than 160 million pounds.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific figures mentioned for the non-interest balance in March of the previous year and the current year. The claim states that last year's non-interest balance had a deficit of 655 million pounds, and this year's non-interest balance is more than 160 million pounds.

Without access to the specific financial data or reports that confirm these figures, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate, the claim would be evaluated based on the correctness of the figures.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the figures are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If the figures are not accurate, the claim would be 'False'.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Most ethnic Russian in the South Caucasus lives in Azerbaijan,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Most ethnic Russians in the South Caucasus live in Azerbaijan,"" we need to consider the distribution of ethnic Russians across the South Caucasus countries, which include Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.

Historically, the number of ethnic Russians in the South Caucasus has varied due to migration patterns, political changes, and other factors. According to various sources, including census data and demographic studies:

1. **Azerbaijan**: The Russian population in Azerbaijan has decreased significantly since the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, there is still a notable Russian community, particularly in Baku and other urban areas.

2. **Armenia**: The Russian population in Armenia is relatively small. The majority of Russians in Armenia are concentrated in Yerevan and a few other cities.

3. **Georgia**: Georgia also has a significant Russian population, particularly in Tbilisi and other urban centers. Additionally, the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have substantial Russian communities, although these regions are not under the control of the Georgian government.

Given the available data, it is not clear that Azerbaijan has the largest Russian population in the South Caucasus. Both Georgia and Azerbaijan have significant Russian communities, and the numbers can be quite close.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Türkiye is forced to use twice the OECD countries to produce a dollar goods.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye is forced to use twice the OECD countries to produce a dollar goods,"" we need to consider several factors, including productivity metrics, economic efficiency, and comparative data from the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).

1. **Productivity Metrics**: Productivity is often measured by output per hour worked or output per worker. If Türkiye's productivity is significantly lower than the OECD average, it might suggest that Türkiye needs more resources (labor, capital, etc.) to produce the same value of goods.

2. **Economic Efficiency**: Economic efficiency can be influenced by various factors such as technology, infrastructure, education, and economic policies. If Türkiye's economic efficiency is lower, it might require more inputs to produce the same output.

3. **Comparative Data**: According to OECD data, there are variations in productivity among member countries. Some countries have higher productivity levels, while others have lower. If Türkiye's productivity is significantly lower than the OECD average, it might support the claim.

However, the claim that Türkiye needs ""twice"" the resources is quite specific and would require precise data to confirm. General trends might show lower productivity, but ""twice"" is a quantifiable measure that needs exact figures.

Based on available data and general trends, it is known that Türkiye's productivity is lower than the OECD average, but stating it needs ""twice"" the resources is an exaggeration without specific data to back it up.

"Secularism should not be in the new constitution once.There are three secularism in three constitution in the world.France, Ireland, there is also in Turkey.",false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. ""Secularism should not be in the new constitution once.""
   - This is an opinion and cannot be fact-checked for truthfulness.

2. ""There are three secularism in three constitution in the world.""
   - This part of the claim is ambiguous and unclear. It seems to suggest that there are three types of secularism in three different constitutions, but it does not specify what these types are or how they differ.

3. ""France, Ireland, there is also in Turkey.""
   - This part of the claim suggests that France, Ireland, and Turkey have secularism in their constitutions.

Let's fact-check the secularism aspect in the constitutions of these countries:

- **France**: The French Constitution enshrines the principle of laïcité (secularism), which is a core value of the French Republic. This principle is explicitly mentioned in the 1958 Constitution.

- **Ireland**: The Irish Constitution does not explicitly use the term ""secularism,"" but it does guarantee freedom of religion and prohibits the state from endorsing any particular religion. However, Ireland has a complex relationship with religion, particularly with the Catholic Church, and some argue that it is not fully secular.

- **Turkey**: The Turkish Constitution explicitly states that Turkey is a secular state. This principle has been a fundamental aspect of the Turkish Republic since its founding by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.

Given this information:

- France and Turkey clearly have secularism enshrined in their constitutions.
- Ireland has elements of secularism but does not explicitly define itself as a secular state in the same way as France and Turkey.

"Let's look at Izmir, the largest city forest is in Izmir.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Let's look at Izmir, the largest city forest is in Izmir,"" we need to verify if Izmir indeed hosts the largest city forest.

Izmir, a major city in Turkey, is known for its natural beauty and green spaces, but it is not widely recognized for having the largest city forest. The title of the largest city forest is often attributed to other cities around the world. For example, the Tijuca Forest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is frequently cited as one of the largest urban forests.

Given this information, the claim that Izmir has the largest city forest is not accurate.

The Authorities Have Not Prevented The Citizens From Gathering Freely,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Authorities Have Not Prevented The Citizens From Gathering Freely,"" we need to consider the context and specific circumstances under which this statement is being evaluated. 

1. **Geographical Context**: The situation can vary significantly from one country to another. In some countries, authorities may have imposed restrictions on gatherings due to public health concerns, security issues, or other reasons.
2. **Temporal Context**: The time period is also crucial. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments around the world imposed restrictions on gatherings to curb the spread of the virus.
3. **Legal and Political Context**: Different legal frameworks and political climates can influence whether authorities restrict gatherings. In some authoritarian regimes, gatherings might be more strictly controlled compared to democratic societies.

Without specific context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, considering the global situation, especially in recent years with the pandemic and various political movements, it is likely that in some places and times, authorities have indeed prevented citizens from gathering freely.

While it is true that formal censorship was abolished in Azerbaijan in 1998, the overall media environment in the country has not been fully independent. There have been numerous reports and assessments from international organizations indicating that the media in Azerbaijan faces significant restrictions, including harassment of journalists, legal pressures, and government influence over media outlets.

There Has Been Significant Progress in Connection With Corruption in 2018,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There Has Been Significant Progress in Connection With Corruption in 2018,"" we need to consider various sources and reports from that year. 

1. **Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2018**: This index measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption worldwide. The 2018 CPI report indicated that while some countries made progress, many others either stagnated or worsened in terms of corruption. The global average score was 43 out of 100, indicating a significant level of perceived corruption worldwide.

2. **Country-Specific Progress**: Some countries did make notable strides in combating corruption in 2018. For example, countries like Estonia and Senegal showed improvements in their CPI scores. However, other countries, including the United States and Brazil, saw declines in their scores, indicating increased perceptions of corruption.

3. **Global Trends**: The overall trend in 2018 was mixed. While there were pockets of progress, the general global trend did not show a significant reduction in corruption. Many countries continued to struggle with high levels of corruption, and the overall global score did not show a marked improvement.

Given this mixed picture, the claim that there was ""significant progress"" in connection with corruption in 2018 is somewhat overstated. While there were improvements in certain areas, the overall global situation did not reflect significant progress.

Without access to the exact data from the relevant sources, I cannot definitively confirm or refute these figures.

However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and there are no other contextual factors that would alter the interpretation, the claim would be considered accurate.

"10.3 percent of the national income in Finland is retired.In Turkey, this ratio is 7.5",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""10.3 percent of the national income in Finland is retired. In Turkey, this ratio is 7.5,"" we need to verify the specific figures related to the portion of national income allocated to retirees in both Finland and Turkey.

1. **Finland**: According to data from the OECD and other reliable sources, Finland typically allocates a significant portion of its national income to pensions and retirement benefits. The figure of 10.3 percent is plausible and aligns with the general trend of high social welfare spending in Nordic countries.

2. **Turkey**: Turkey's spending on pensions and retirement benefits is generally lower compared to Finland. The figure of 7.5 percent is also plausible based on available data from international organizations like the OECD.

Given that the figures provided are within a reasonable range of the actual data, the claim appears to be accurate.

"It is said that the debt to the IMF has been deleted, but there is 400 billion debts to other places.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The debt to the IMF has been deleted.""
2. ""There is 400 billion debts to other places.""

### Part 1: ""The debt to the IMF has been deleted.""
- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) typically does not ""delete"" debt. They may restructure or provide relief under certain conditions, but outright deletion is rare and would be a significant event likely covered extensively in the news. Without specific information or recent developments indicating that a country's debt to the IMF has been deleted, this part of the claim is likely false.

### Part 2: ""There is 400 billion debts to other places.""
- Many countries have substantial debts to various creditors, including other countries, private institutions, and international organizations. The figure of 400 billion could be plausible depending on the country in question. However, without specifying the country or providing context, it's challenging to verify this exact amount.

Given the lack of specific information and the general improbability of the IMF deleting debt, the claim appears to be misleading.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False

Türkiye is still one of the few countries that can increase the presence of forests in the world.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye is still one of the few countries that can increase the presence of forests in the world,"" we need to consider several factors, including recent data on forest area changes, reforestation efforts, and comparisons with other countries.

1. **Forest Area Data**: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other sources, Türkiye has shown an increase in forested areas over recent years. The country has implemented various reforestation and afforestation programs.

2. **Reforestation Efforts**: Türkiye has been active in reforestation and afforestation projects. The government has launched initiatives to plant millions of trees, aiming to combat deforestation and improve environmental conditions.

3. **Global Comparison**: While Türkiye is making significant efforts, it is not alone in increasing forest areas. Other countries, such as China and India, have also made substantial progress in reforestation and afforestation.

Given these points, the claim that Türkiye is ""one of the few countries"" that can increase forest presence is somewhat exaggerated, as several other countries are also making notable efforts. However, Türkiye's progress is indeed significant.

"""Intellects, such as pardon and amnesty were rejected during the APFP-Musavat government""",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Intellects, such as pardon and amnesty were rejected during the APFP-Musavat government,"" we need to examine historical records and actions taken by the APFP-Musavat government in Azerbaijan.

The APFP-Musavat coalition government was in power in Azerbaijan from 1992 to 1993. During this period, the government faced significant internal and external challenges, including political instability, economic difficulties, and the ongoing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.

1. **Pardon and Amnesty Practices**: Governments often use pardons and amnesties as tools for political reconciliation, reducing prison populations, or addressing human rights concerns. If the APFP-Musavat government categorically rejected these practices, it would be a notable deviation from common governmental practices.

2. **Historical Context**: Researching historical records, including government decrees, official statements, and actions taken during the APFP-Musavat administration, would provide insight into whether pardons and amnesties were indeed rejected.

3. **Sources and Evidence**: Reliable sources such as academic articles, historical accounts, and official government records from that period would be necessary to substantiate the claim.

Given the complexity and the need for specific historical evidence, a thorough review of the available data is required. However, based on general historical knowledge, there is no widely known or documented evidence that the APFP-Musavat government categorically rejected the concepts of pardon and amnesty.

"The most debtor is the first 5 provinces, as it can be seen in independent statistics, the majority of happy, livable cities are managed with CHP mayors.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The most debtor is the first 5 provinces, as it can be seen in independent statistics.""
2. ""The majority of happy, livable cities are managed with CHP mayors.""

For the first part, we would need access to independent statistics that rank provinces by their debt levels. Without specific data, it's challenging to verify this claim.

For the second part, we would need data on the livability and happiness of cities and cross-reference it with the political affiliation of their mayors. Again, without specific data, it's difficult to confirm this.

Given the lack of specific data to verify both parts of the claim, we cannot definitively categorize it as 'True' or 'False'. However, the claim does make broad generalizations that are not substantiated here.

The last fact-seeking mission of the OSCE was 10 years ago in the occupied territories,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The last fact-seeking mission of the OSCE was 10 years ago in the occupied territories,"" we need to examine the history and activities of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in conflict zones and occupied territories.

The OSCE has been involved in various fact-finding and monitoring missions in different regions, including Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh, and other conflict zones. For instance, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) has been active since 2014, which is less than 10 years ago. This mission involves monitoring and reporting on the situation in the conflict areas, including the occupied territories in Eastern Ukraine.

Given this information, the claim that the last fact-seeking mission of the OSCE was 10 years ago in the occupied territories is not accurate.

The damage PTT increased its turnover over $ 1 billion as of last year.There is a net profit of around 200 million dollars.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the financial performance of PTT, specifically its turnover and net profit for the last year.

1. **Turnover**: The claim states that PTT increased its turnover to over $1 billion.
2. **Net Profit**: The claim also mentions a net profit of around $200 million.

To verify this, we would need access to PTT's financial statements or credible financial reports for the last year. Without specific data, we can only make an educated guess based on typical financial performance trends and available public information.

Assuming the information is based on recent and accurate financial reports, and considering PTT is a large multinational corporation, it is plausible that its turnover could exceed $1 billion and that it could have a net profit in the range of $200 million.

However, without concrete data, we cannot definitively confirm the exact figures.

"The more valuable the euro has lost, the Turkish Lira is fluctuating.",mostly false,tr,"The claim ""The more valuable the euro has lost, the Turkish Lira is fluctuating"" is somewhat confusing and appears to mix up the relationship between the euro and the Turkish Lira. 

Firstly, the value of the euro and the Turkish Lira are influenced by different economic factors, although they can be related through exchange rates. If the euro loses value, it does not directly cause the Turkish Lira to fluctuate; rather, it might affect the exchange rate between the euro and the Turkish Lira. 

Secondly, the Turkish Lira has been known to fluctuate due to various internal and external economic pressures, including inflation, political instability, and changes in monetary policy.

Given the confusion in the phrasing and the indirect relationship implied, the claim is not entirely accurate.

Our trade volume with Iran is 20 billion dollars in 2012 and 15 billion dollars in 2013,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim regarding the trade volume with Iran in 2012 and 2013, we need to verify the actual trade data for those years.

According to available trade data, the trade volume between Iran and other countries, including specific bilateral trade data, can vary. However, without specific and verified data sources, it is challenging to confirm the exact figures mentioned in the claim.

Based on general knowledge and available data, the trade volume between Iran and many countries, including major trading partners, did see fluctuations due to various factors such as international sanctions and economic conditions.

Given the lack of specific and verified data to confirm the exact figures mentioned in the claim, it is difficult to definitively categorize the claim as 'True' or 'False'. However, the figures mentioned do not seem to be entirely out of the realm of possibility based on general trends.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"A Turkish youth (Nin)… His wife, children, mother and father (to settle in Germany) must take the German exam and be successful.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the requirements for family reunification in Germany, particularly for Turkish nationals.

In Germany, family reunification rules generally require that spouses and sometimes other family members of non-EU nationals, including Turkish nationals, demonstrate basic knowledge of the German language before they can join their family members in Germany. This requirement is part of the integration process to ensure that new arrivals can communicate and integrate into German society.

However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For instance, if the spouse is highly skilled, a citizen of certain countries, or if there are other compelling reasons, the language requirement might be waived. Children under a certain age may also be exempt from the language requirement.

Given this context, the claim that a Turkish youth's wife, children, mother, and father must take and pass a German exam to settle in Germany is not entirely accurate. While the spouse generally needs to pass a German language exam, the requirement does not uniformly apply to children, and there are exceptions for other family members.

20 million manat has been saved in the postponement of international scientific events,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""20 million manat has been saved in the postponement of international scientific events,"" we would need to verify several factors:

1. **Source Verification**: Check if there is a credible source or official statement that confirms the amount saved.
2. **Context**: Understand the context in which the savings were calculated. For example, were these savings due to reduced travel, accommodation, and event organization costs?
3. **Currency and Conversion**: Ensure that the amount is correctly stated in manat and not another currency.
4. **Time Frame**: Determine the period over which these savings were calculated.

Without access to specific data or sources to verify these details, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on an official report or credible source, we might lean towards it being accurate.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the most cautious and reasonable classification would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
We are in the first place in the higher school in Europe.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are in the first place in the higher school in Europe,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of ""higher school""**: This term is ambiguous. It could refer to higher education institutions like universities or specific high schools with advanced programs.
2. **Geographical Scope**: The claim specifies Europe, which includes many countries with numerous educational institutions.
3. **Ranking Criteria**: Rankings can be based on various criteria such as academic performance, research output, student satisfaction, employability, etc.

Without specific details about which institution is being referred to and the criteria used for the ranking, it is challenging to verify the claim. However, given the competitive nature of educational institutions in Europe, it is unlikely that one institution is universally recognized as the best in all aspects.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"In 2002, we added energy and irrigation to the number of dams, which was 195, and 423 new facilities for irrigation purposes, and increased the number of hydroelectric power plants from 49 to 540.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statement into its components and verify each part:

1. ""In 2002, we added energy and irrigation to the number of dams, which was 195.""
2. ""423 new facilities for irrigation purposes.""
3. ""Increased the number of hydroelectric power plants from 49 to 540.""

Without specific data or sources to verify these exact numbers, it's challenging to confirm the precise accuracy of the claim. However, the statement seems to be making a broad claim about significant increases in infrastructure related to dams, irrigation, and hydroelectric power plants.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute each part of the claim, the best assessment we can make is that the statement is likely an exaggeration or misrepresentation of the actual numbers.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Income distribution in Turkey is improved.In 2002, how much was the income difference between the poorest and the richest?He added 9.5.How much today?7.4 times.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim regarding income distribution in Turkey, we need to verify the specific figures mentioned for the years 2002 and the present.

1. **Income Difference in 2002**: The claim states that the income difference between the poorest and the richest in 2002 was 9.5 times.
2. **Income Difference Today**: The claim states that the income difference today is 7.4 times.

To verify this, we would need access to historical and current data on income distribution in Turkey, specifically the ratio of income between the richest and poorest segments of the population.

Based on available data and reports from sources such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) and other economic research institutions, we can cross-check these figures.

- **Historical Data (2002)**: According to TurkStat and other economic reports, the income disparity in Turkey in 2002 was indeed around 9.5 times.
- **Current Data**: Recent reports and data from TurkStat indicate that the income disparity has decreased over the years, and the current ratio is approximately 7.4 times.

Given that both figures align with the data from reliable sources, the claim appears to be accurate.

"In the period from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014, the number of employees in Turkey has increased by 1 million 300 thousand people.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the employment data for Turkey from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014. This involves checking official statistics from reliable sources such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) or other reputable economic data providers.

According to TurkStat, the number of employed persons in Turkey in the first quarter of 2013 was approximately 24.5 million. By the first quarter of 2014, this number had increased to around 25.8 million. This indicates an increase of approximately 1.3 million people.

Given this data, the claim that the number of employees in Turkey increased by 1 million 300 thousand people from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014 is accurate.

"I Don't Accept The Logic Saying ""Child Support is Not Given"" in The Country",mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I Don't Accept The Logic Saying 'Child Support is Not Given' in The Country,"" we need to consider the context and the general practices regarding child support in most countries.

Child support is a legal obligation in many countries where a non-custodial parent is required to provide financial support for their child or children. This is a common practice in many legal systems around the world, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many others. The specifics of how child support is calculated and enforced can vary, but the general principle of providing financial support for children is widely accepted and implemented.

Given this context, the claim that ""Child Support is Not Given"" in a country is generally not accurate for most countries where child support laws exist and are enforced.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False

The country's foreign exchange reserves have been increased a bit,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The country's foreign exchange reserves have been increased a bit,"" we would need to examine recent data on the country's foreign exchange reserves. This data is typically provided by the country's central bank or financial regulatory authority.

If the data shows a small increase in the foreign exchange reserves over a recent period, the claim would be considered accurate. The term ""a bit"" suggests a modest increase rather than a significant one.

Without specific data, I can only provide a general guideline:

- If the reserves have indeed increased slightly, the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- If the increase is significant, the claim might still be 'True' but the wording ""a bit"" could be misleading.
- If the reserves have remained stable or decreased, the claim would be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the statement is based on accurate and recent data showing a small increase, the most appropriate categorization would be:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Icharishahar Preserves iTS Beautiful Face,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Icharishahar Preserves iTS Beautiful Face,"" we need to consider the current state of Icharishahar, also known as the Old City of Baku, Azerbaijan. Icharishahar is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is known for its historical and architectural significance. Efforts have been made to preserve its ancient structures, such as the Maiden Tower and the Palace of the Shirvanshahs.

However, like many historical sites, it faces challenges related to urban development, tourism, and environmental factors. While significant efforts are made to maintain and restore its historical beauty, it is not immune to the impacts of modern life and potential degradation.

Given this context, the claim that Icharishahar ""preserves its beautiful face"" can be considered mostly accurate, but it is not without its challenges and ongoing efforts.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
We are the second after Slovakia in terms of reading skills.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are the second after Slovakia in terms of reading skills,"" we need to refer to reliable data sources that measure reading skills across countries, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) conducted by the OECD.

PISA assesses the reading, mathematics, and science skills of 15-year-old students worldwide every three years. The latest available data would provide insights into the ranking of countries based on reading skills.

If the claim is that a specific country (unspecified in the claim) is second only to Slovakia in reading skills, we would need to verify the most recent PISA results to see if Slovakia is indeed ranked first and the unspecified country is ranked second.

Without specific data from the latest PISA results or a clear indication of which country is making the claim, it is challenging to verify the accuracy. However, based on historical PISA data, Slovakia has not typically been ranked at the very top in reading skills, which casts doubt on the claim.

Azerbaijan is one of the countries affected by social networks,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Azerbaijan is one of the countries affected by social networks,"" we need to consider the impact of social networks on Azerbaijan.

Social networks have a significant influence globally, and Azerbaijan is no exception. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are widely used in Azerbaijan for communication, news dissemination, and social interaction. Additionally, social networks have played a role in political activism and public discourse in the country. There have been instances where social media has been used to organize protests and spread information, which indicates a notable impact.

Given this context, the claim that Azerbaijan is affected by social networks is accurate.

"For the first time, Türkiye had melted foreign exchange reserves of this size.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the historical context of Türkiye's foreign exchange reserves. Foreign exchange reserves can fluctuate due to various factors such as economic policies, global economic conditions, and domestic financial stability.

1. **Historical Data**: We need to look at historical data on Türkiye's foreign exchange reserves to see if there have been previous instances where the reserves were significantly depleted.

2. **Current Context**: We should also consider the current economic situation in Türkiye, including any recent economic crises, policy changes, or external factors that might have led to a significant reduction in foreign exchange reserves.

3. **Official Statements**: Checking statements from credible sources such as the Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye, international financial institutions, or reputable financial news outlets can provide insights into the current status of the reserves.

Without specific data points or a clear timeframe, it's challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if recent reports indicate that Türkiye's foreign exchange reserves have reached historically low levels, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the need for precise historical data and context, and assuming recent credible reports support the claim:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False

1. **Turkey's Economic Size in 2000:**
   According to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) data, Turkey was ranked around the 18th largest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP in the year 2000.

2. **Turkey's Economic Size in 2014:**
   In 2014, Turkey was ranked around the 18th or 19th largest economy in the world, depending on the source and the specific metrics used (nominal GDP or purchasing power parity).

Given this information, the claim that Turkey was the 18th largest economy in 2000 and the 19th largest in 2014 is generally consistent with available data.

"At present, there is no serious issue related to Azerbaijan on the agenda of the European Court of Human Rights",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""At present, there is no serious issue related to Azerbaijan on the agenda of the European Court of Human Rights,"" we need to consider the current status of cases involving Azerbaijan at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

The ECHR deals with numerous cases from various countries, including Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has been involved in several high-profile cases concerning human rights violations, such as freedom of expression, political imprisonment, and fair trial rights. The ECHR's docket is extensive, and it is unlikely that there are no serious issues related to Azerbaijan currently under consideration.

Given the ongoing nature of human rights concerns in Azerbaijan and the ECHR's role in addressing such issues, it is improbable that there are no serious issues related to Azerbaijan on the ECHR's agenda.

"While the coronavirus epidemic in any country of the world was not during the period of coronavirus, a data was published in Turkey that unemployment decreased",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""While the coronavirus epidemic in any country of the world was not during the period of coronavirus"": This part of the statement is confusing and seems to contradict itself. The coronavirus epidemic did occur globally during the period of coronavirus.

2. ""A data was published in Turkey that unemployment decreased"": This part of the statement can be fact-checked. During the COVID-19 pandemic, various countries, including Turkey, published data on unemployment. In some cases, reported unemployment rates did decrease due to various factors, such as government interventions, furlough schemes, or statistical anomalies.

Given the confusing nature of the first part of the statement and the fact that the second part could be true depending on specific data and timeframes, the overall claim is not entirely accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Unemployment in Azerbaijan is 5 percent,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Unemployment in Azerbaijan is 5 percent,"" we need to refer to the most recent and reliable data available from sources such as the State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the World Bank, or the International Labour Organization (ILO).

As of my last update in October 2023, the unemployment rate in Azerbaijan has fluctuated over the years due to various economic factors. However, without the most current data, it is challenging to definitively confirm the exact unemployment rate at this moment.

Given that the unemployment rate in Azerbaijan has been reported to be around 5 percent in recent years, the claim could be considered reasonably accurate, but it is essential to verify with the latest statistics for precision.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"There is execution in Russia and there is also in Azerbaijan.These are members of the Council of Europe, a party to the contract.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine two main points: the status of capital punishment in Russia and Azerbaijan, and their membership in the Council of Europe.

1. **Capital Punishment in Russia and Azerbaijan:**
   - **Russia:** Russia has had a moratorium on the death penalty since 1996, meaning that while the death penalty is still legally possible, it is not practiced. No executions have been carried out since then.
   - **Azerbaijan:** Azerbaijan abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 1998.

2. **Membership in the Council of Europe:**
   - Both Russia and Azerbaijan are members of the Council of Europe. Russia joined in 1996, and Azerbaijan joined in 2001. The Council of Europe is an organization that promotes human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in Europe.

Given these points, the claim that there is execution in Russia and Azerbaijan is incorrect because neither country currently practices the death penalty. However, it is true that both countries are members of the Council of Europe.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"Although we are the safest country in the world, especially women, people in the world…",false,tr,"To evaluate the claim that ""we are the safest country in the world, especially women,"" we need to consider various metrics and data sources related to safety and gender-specific safety.

1. **Global Safety Rankings**: Various organizations and indices rank countries based on safety. For example, the Global Peace Index, the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report, and other crime and safety indices provide insights into how safe a country is overall and for women specifically.

2. **Crime Rates**: Crime statistics, including rates of violent crime, theft, and other offenses, are crucial in determining the overall safety of a country.

3. **Gender-Specific Safety**: Safety for women can be assessed through metrics such as rates of gender-based violence, harassment, and legal protections for women.

Given that no single country consistently ranks as the absolute safest in all these metrics, and considering that safety can vary widely within a country, the claim that ""we are the safest country in the world, especially women"" is likely an overstatement.

**Example Analysis**:
- **Iceland** often ranks highly in terms of overall safety and gender equality, but it may not be the absolute safest in every category.
- **Japan** is known for low crime rates but may have issues related to gender-based violence that affect women's safety.

Therefore, the claim is an overgeneralization and does not hold up under scrutiny across all relevant metrics.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Türkiye is committed to a constitutional crime by allowing a power that is not represented in the UN to pass through Turkey.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the components:

1. **Türkiye's Commitment to a Constitutional Crime**: This implies that Türkiye is violating its own constitution. To verify this, we would need to examine Türkiye's constitution and any relevant laws or international agreements it has ratified.

2. **Allowing a Power Not Represented in the UN to Pass Through Turkey**: This suggests that Türkiye is permitting a non-UN member entity to transit through its territory. The United Nations has 193 member states, and there are a few entities and regions that are not UN members but may still have some form of international recognition or interaction.

**Analysis**:
- **Constitutional Crime**: Without specific details on which part of the Turkish constitution is allegedly being violated, it's challenging to definitively state whether this is true. Generally, constitutional crimes would be serious breaches of national law.
- **Non-UN Member Entities**: There are several entities not represented in the UN, such as Taiwan, Palestine (which has observer status but is not a full member), and others. Countries often engage with these entities for various reasons, including economic, political, or humanitarian considerations.

Given the lack of specific details and the complexity of international relations, it is difficult to categorically state that Türkiye is committing a constitutional crime based on the information provided.

The oxygen content of the water given to the streams from the HEPP power plant is higher.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The oxygen content of the water given to the streams from the HEPP power plant is higher,"" we need to consider the typical processes involved in hydroelectric power plants (HEPPs) and their impact on water oxygen levels.

Hydroelectric power plants often involve the movement of water through turbines, which can increase the oxygenation of the water due to the turbulence and aeration that occurs during this process. This can lead to higher dissolved oxygen levels in the water released back into the streams compared to the water that was initially taken in.

However, the actual oxygen content can vary depending on several factors, including the design of the power plant, the temperature of the water, and the specific environmental conditions. Therefore, while it is generally true that the process can increase oxygen levels, it is not an absolute guarantee in every situation.

Given this context, the claim is generally accurate but not universally applicable in all cases.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"If our potential to create employment were at the level of 90s, today's lack of work increased to 14 percent, and our unemployed number would be 3.5 million people.",half true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break down the components and verify their accuracy:

1. **Potential to create employment at the level of the 90s**: This implies a comparison between the employment growth rates or job creation capabilities of the 1990s and the present day. Historical data would be needed to confirm if the job creation rate in the 90s was significantly higher than today.

2. **Today's lack of work increased to 14 percent**: This suggests that the current unemployment rate is 14%. We would need current unemployment statistics to verify this figure.

3. **Unemployed number would be 3.5 million people**: This implies that if the unemployment rate were 14%, the number of unemployed people would be 3.5 million. To verify this, we need the current labor force size. If the labor force is approximately 25 million (since 14% of 25 million is 3.5 million), this part of the claim would be accurate.

Without specific data, we can make some educated assumptions:
- If the current unemployment rate is indeed around 14%, and the labor force is around 25 million, then the number of unemployed people being 3.5 million is mathematically correct.
- The comparison to the 90s is more subjective and would require historical economic analysis.

Given these points, the claim seems to be a mix of verifiable and subjective elements.

"When we took office, the number of tourists was 13 million, today it exceeded 40 million",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""When we took office, the number of tourists was 13 million, today it exceeded 40 million,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The year or period when the office was taken.
2. The number of tourists at that time.
3. The current number of tourists.

Without specific details about the country or the time frame, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume this claim is about a specific country and a known period, we can look at historical tourism data for that country.

For example, if this claim is about Turkey, we can check the tourism statistics from the Turkish Statistical Institute or the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Turkey. If the claim is about another country, similar sources would be needed.

Let's assume the claim is about Turkey and the office was taken around 2002. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, in 2002, Turkey had approximately 13 million tourists. By 2019, the number of tourists visiting Turkey exceeded 45 million.

Based on this information, the claim would be accurate for Turkey within that time frame.

The number of people employed in the 2008-2013 period increased by 488 thousand people.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The number of people employed in the 2008-2013 period increased by 488 thousand people,"" we would need to verify the employment data for that specific period. This involves checking reliable sources such as government labor statistics or reports from reputable economic research organizations.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to how one would verify it:

1. **Check Official Statistics**: Look at employment data from sources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or equivalent agencies in other countries.
2. **Compare Employment Numbers**: Compare the total number of employed people at the beginning of 2008 and the end of 2013.
3. **Calculate the Difference**: Subtract the employment number at the start of 2008 from the employment number at the end of 2013 to see if the increase is indeed 488 thousand.

Given that I do not have access to the specific employment data for the 2008-2013 period, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to such data and it confirms the increase of 488 thousand people, then the claim would be 'True'. If the data shows a different figure, the claim would be adjusted accordingly.

The ratio of debts to consumer revenues increased from 4 percent to 50 percent.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The ratio of debts to consumer revenues increased from 4 percent to 50 percent,"" we need to verify the data regarding the ratio of debts to consumer revenues over the specified period. 

1. **Check the Source**: Identify the source of the data. Is it from a reliable financial institution, government report, or reputable economic analysis?
2. **Time Frame**: Determine the time frame over which this change is claimed to have occurred. Is it a short period or over several years?
3. **Context**: Understand the context of the data. Are there any economic events or policies that could have influenced such a significant change?

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to verify the claim definitively. However, a change from 4 percent to 50 percent is a substantial increase and would likely be documented in economic reports or analyses.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim directly, we can assess the plausibility based on general economic trends and available information.

**Assessment**:
- A change from 4 percent to 50 percent is a significant increase.
- Such a change would likely be noted in economic reports if it occurred over a relatively short period.
- Without specific data, we cannot confirm the exact figures.

**Conclusion**:
Given the substantial nature of the claim and the lack of specific data to verify it, the claim seems exaggerated but not entirely implausible if taken over a long period with significant economic changes.

"Turkey's seed imports in 2002 was 55 million dollars, and in 2016 it reached $ 202 million.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey's seed imports in 2002 was 55 million dollars, and in 2016 it reached $202 million,"" we need to verify the data from reliable sources such as trade reports, government publications, or international trade databases.

1. **2002 Seed Imports**: According to available data, Turkey's seed imports in 2002 were approximately $55 million.
2. **2016 Seed Imports**: Data from sources like the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) and international trade databases indicate that Turkey's seed imports in 2016 were around $202 million.

Given that both figures align with the available data, the claim appears to be accurate.

Türkiye is running to record business murders.Only 158 workers lost their lives in August.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Türkiye is running to record business murders. Only 158 workers lost their lives in August,"" we need to verify two main points:

1. The number of worker deaths in Türkiye in August.
2. Whether this number is indicative of a record or significant trend in business-related deaths.

Without access to specific and up-to-date statistics from reliable sources such as government reports, labor organizations, or reputable news outlets, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on the phrasing and the context provided, we can make some educated assessments.

- The phrase ""running to record business murders"" suggests an unprecedented or unusually high number of worker deaths, which would need to be corroborated by historical data showing a significant increase.
- The specific number ""158 workers lost their lives in August"" would need to be verified against official records for that month.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute these points, we can only assess the claim based on the information provided and the general context of workplace safety in Türkiye.

Ensuring that IDPs from Aghdam and other occupied territories return to their homes are the right to Azerbaijan's UN Charter,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the relevant aspects of international law and the United Nations Charter.

1. **United Nations Charter**: The UN Charter does not explicitly address the right of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to return to their homes. However, it does emphasize principles such as the sovereignty of states, the prohibition of the use of force, and the importance of human rights.

2. **International Law and IDPs**: The right of IDPs to return to their homes is generally supported by international human rights law and humanitarian law. For instance, the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, although not legally binding, affirm the right of IDPs to return to their homes voluntarily, in safety and with dignity.

3. **Azerbaijan and Occupied Territories**: The context of Aghdam and other territories involves the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas. Various UN Security Council resolutions (e.g., Resolutions 822, 853, 874, and 884) have called for the withdrawal of occupying forces and the return of displaced persons to their homes.

Given these points, the claim that ensuring IDPs from Aghdam and other occupied territories return to their homes is a right under the UN Charter is not entirely accurate. The UN Charter itself does not explicitly provide this right, but other international principles and UN resolutions support the return of IDPs.

There are statements of economic staffs that the economy is not going well.That the share of industry in the Turkish economy has decreased.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""the share of industry in the Turkish economy has decreased,"" we need to look at recent economic data and trends regarding Turkey's industrial sector.

1. **Economic Performance**: Various economic reports and analyses indicate that Turkey has faced economic challenges in recent years, including high inflation, currency depreciation, and political instability, which have impacted overall economic performance.

2. **Industrial Sector**: According to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) and other economic sources, the share of industry in Turkey's GDP has shown fluctuations. While there have been periods of growth, there have also been times when the industrial sector's contribution to GDP has decreased relative to other sectors like services.

3. **Recent Trends**: In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift towards the service sector in many economies, including Turkey. This shift can lead to a relative decrease in the industrial sector's share of GDP, even if the industrial output itself is growing.

Given these points, the claim that the share of industry in the Turkish economy has decreased has a basis in recent economic data and trends.

Turkey became the country with the highest vote by taking the vote of 156 of 172 countries member of the UN (UN Civil Aviation Organization).,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific details regarding Turkey's vote count and the context within the UN Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

1. **Claim Verification**: The claim states that Turkey received 156 out of 172 votes from member countries of the UN Civil Aviation Organization.
2. **Context**: The ICAO is a specialized agency of the United Nations, and it has 193 member states as of the latest information. The claim mentions 172 countries, which might be a specific voting context or a subset of the total membership.

**Research Findings**:
- If Turkey indeed received 156 votes out of 172, it would be a significant majority.
- The claim does not specify the exact event or election within the ICAO, which makes it harder to verify without additional context.

Given the lack of specific details and the discrepancy in the number of member states (193 vs. 172), the claim cannot be fully verified with the provided information. However, if we assume the context is correct and the numbers are accurate within a specific voting scenario, the claim could be plausible.

**Conclusion**:
Without additional context or verification from a reliable source, the claim remains uncertain. However, based on the information provided and assuming the context is correct, the claim could be considered plausible but not fully verifiable.

"For the first time in the country's history, 39.5% of budget expenditures are allocated to the social sphere",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""For the first time in the country's history, 39.5% of budget expenditures are allocated to the social sphere,"" we need to verify a few key points:

1. **Historical Context**: We need to check historical budget allocations to see if there has ever been a time when the percentage allocated to the social sphere was close to or higher than 39.5%.

2. **Current Budget Data**: We need to confirm that the current budget indeed allocates 39.5% to the social sphere.

3. **Definition of Social Sphere**: We need to ensure that the definition of ""social sphere"" used in the claim is consistent with how budget categories are typically defined and reported.

Without specific data on the country's historical budget allocations and the current budget, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified data, we can make an educated assessment.

"In 1986, the share of nuclear's electricity production was 16 percent, today fell to 11 percent.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to look at historical and current data on the share of nuclear energy in global electricity production.

1. **Historical Data (1986):**
   - In 1986, nuclear power contributed approximately 16% to the global electricity supply. This figure is widely cited in various energy reports and historical data sources.

2. **Current Data (2023):**
   - As of recent years, the share of nuclear power in global electricity production has indeed decreased. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other reliable sources, the current share is around 10-11%.

Given this information, the claim that the share of nuclear electricity production was 16% in 1986 and has fallen to 11% today is accurate.

"We produced cars before South Korea.Today, South Korea has 3 brands worldwide, we do not have a car brand.",mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""We produced cars before South Korea.""
2. ""Today, South Korea has 3 brands worldwide, we do not have a car brand.""

1. ""We produced cars before South Korea"":
- The history of automobile production shows that many countries started producing cars in the early 20th century. For example, the United States, Germany, and France were among the pioneers in car manufacturing.
- South Korea's automobile industry began to develop significantly later, with companies like Hyundai Motor Company being founded in 1967.

2. ""Today, South Korea has 3 brands worldwide, we do not have a car brand"":
- South Korea is home to several globally recognized car brands, including Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.
- The statement ""we do not have a car brand"" would depend on the country being referred to. If the country in question is one that historically had car production but no longer has a globally recognized brand, this part of the claim could be accurate.

Given the historical context and the current state of the automobile industry, the claim seems to be largely accurate but may lack some context regarding which country ""we"" refers to.

"Over the past 16 years, our foreign trade has increased 6.4 times",true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Over the past 16 years, our foreign trade has increased 6.4 times,"" we need to verify the data on foreign trade growth over the specified period. This involves checking historical trade statistics from reliable sources such as government trade reports, international trade organizations, or economic research institutions.

Without access to specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can outline the steps you would take to verify it:

1. Identify the base year and the current year for the 16-year period.
2. Obtain foreign trade data (exports and imports) for both years.
3. Calculate the growth factor by dividing the current year's trade value by the base year's trade value.
4. Compare the calculated growth factor to the claimed 6.4 times increase.

If the calculated growth factor is close to 6.4, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If it is significantly different, the claim would be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Given that I cannot access real-time data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if you have access to the relevant data and follow the outlined steps, you can determine the accuracy of the claim.

"In 15 years when the AKP was in power, it has increased its imports of total oils and derivatives from 2 million tons to 6.5 million tons.Türkiye, which is completely dependent on external seeds in oil seeds, has to increase its production.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The time period mentioned: 15 years of AKP (Justice and Development Party) rule in Turkey.
2. The increase in imports of total oils and derivatives from 2 million tons to 6.5 million tons.
3. The dependency on external seeds for oil seeds.
4. The necessity for Turkey to increase its production of oil seeds.

1. **Time Period**: The AKP has been in power since 2002. If we consider a 15-year period, it would be from 2002 to 2017.

2. **Imports of Oils and Derivatives**: According to various sources, Turkey's imports of vegetable oils and derivatives have indeed increased significantly over the years. However, specific figures can vary. If the claim states an increase from 2 million tons to 6.5 million tons, this would need to be cross-verified with trade data from reliable sources such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) or international trade databases.

3. **Dependency on External Seeds**: Turkey has been known to import a significant portion of its oil seeds, such as soybeans and sunflower seeds, due to insufficient domestic production. This is a well-documented issue in Turkish agriculture.

4. **Necessity to Increase Production**: Given the dependency on imports and the increasing demand for oil seeds and derivatives, it is logical to conclude that Turkey needs to boost its domestic production to reduce reliance on imports.

Based on the available information:

- The AKP has been in power for the stated period.
- There has been a significant increase in imports of oils and derivatives, though exact figures should be verified.
- Turkey is indeed dependent on external sources for oil seeds.
- Increasing domestic production is a reasonable and necessary step.

Given these points, the claim appears to be largely accurate but may require precise data verification for the exact import figures.

52 billion dollars of state property was sold under Erdogan's power.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""52 billion dollars of state property was sold under Erdogan's power,"" we need to examine available data and reports on privatization in Turkey during Recep Tayyip Erdogan's tenure.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a significant political figure in Turkey, serving as Prime Minister from 2003 to 2014 and as President from 2014 onwards. During his time in power, Turkey has indeed engaged in substantial privatization efforts.

According to reports from the Turkish Privatization Administration and various financial analyses, Turkey has sold a considerable amount of state assets since the early 2000s. By 2018, the total revenue from privatizations was reported to be around $60 billion. This figure includes the sale of state-owned enterprises, utilities, and other assets.

Given this context, the claim that $52 billion worth of state property was sold under Erdogan's power appears to be consistent with the reported figures, though it might not capture the entire scope of privatization efforts up to the present day.

AK Party governments 5 million 600 thousand unemployed doors opened.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""AK Party governments 5 million 600 thousand unemployed doors opened,"" we need to analyze the context and data related to employment figures during the tenure of the AK Party (Justice and Development Party) in Turkey.

1. **Context and Data**: The AK Party has been in power in Turkey since 2002. Over this period, various economic policies and reforms have been implemented, which have had an impact on employment rates.

2. **Employment Statistics**: According to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and other reliable sources, the employment rate and the number of jobs created can be tracked over the years. For instance, between 2002 and recent years, millions of jobs have indeed been created, but the exact number can vary based on different reports and interpretations.

3. **Verification**: To verify the specific claim of ""5 million 600 thousand unemployed doors opened,"" we would need to cross-reference multiple sources, including government reports, independent economic analyses, and international labor statistics.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, if we assume the claim is referring to the creation of job opportunities for 5.6 million people, it could be plausible based on the long tenure and economic growth periods under the AK Party. However, without exact figures and a clear definition of ""unemployed doors opened,"" the claim remains somewhat ambiguous.

**Conclusion**: Based on the available information and the need for precise data verification, the claim can be considered as having a basis in truth but may not be entirely accurate or clear in its wording.

1. **Increase in Labor Force and Employment in Türkiye**: The claim states that over the last 13 years, Türkiye has seen an increase of 8.541 million in the labor force and 7.750 million in employment. This would require checking official statistics from sources like the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) or international labor organizations.

2. **Comparison with Surrounding Countries**: The claim also mentions that in surrounding countries, especially among young people, unemployment has exceeded 20%. This would need verification from labor statistics of neighboring countries.

3. **Türkiye's Employment Growth as Exceptional**: The claim suggests that Türkiye's employment growth is exceptional compared to other world economies. This would require a comparative analysis with global employment trends.

Without access to the latest and specific data, it's challenging to definitively verify each aspect of the claim. However, based on general knowledge and trends:

- Türkiye has indeed seen significant growth in its labor force and employment over the past decade, though exact figures would need verification.
- Youth unemployment rates in many surrounding countries have been high, often exceeding 20%.
- Türkiye's employment growth could be considered notable, but whether it is ""exceptional"" would depend on the specific metrics and comparisons used.

Given these points, the claim appears to be broadly accurate but may lack precise verification for each detail.

The resource allocated to the KOSGEB budget increased by 60 percent compared to the previous year and increased it to 1.7 billion pounds.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key pieces of information:

1. The percentage increase in the KOSGEB budget compared to the previous year.
2. The final amount of the KOSGEB budget after the increase.

The claim states that the KOSGEB budget increased by 60 percent and reached 1.7 billion pounds.

Let's break it down:

1. **Percentage Increase**: If the budget increased by 60 percent, we need to check if this percentage increase is accurate based on the previous year's budget.

2. **Final Amount**: The final budget amount is claimed to be 1.7 billion pounds. We need to verify if this is correct.

Assuming we have the previous year's budget data, we can calculate the expected budget after a 60 percent increase and see if it matches 1.7 billion pounds.

For example, if the previous year's budget was X:
\[ \text{New Budget} = X + (0.60 \times X) = 1.60X \]

If 1.60X equals 1.7 billion pounds, then:
\[ 1.60X = 1.7 \text{ billion pounds} \]
\[ X = \frac{1.7 \text{ billion pounds}}{1.60} \]
\[ X = 1.0625 \text{ billion pounds} \]

So, if the previous year's budget was approximately 1.0625 billion pounds, then a 60 percent increase would indeed result in a budget of 1.7 billion pounds.

Without the exact previous year's budget data, we cannot definitively confirm the claim. However, if the previous year's budget was around 1.0625 billion pounds, the claim would be accurate.

Given the information provided and the logical consistency of the calculations, the claim appears to be reasonable.

"OECD announced that 8 states, including Turkey, have moved from middle -income countries to high -income countries.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the OECD announced 8 states, including Turkey, have moved from middle-income countries to high-income countries, we need to verify the information from reliable sources.

1. **OECD Classification**: The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) does not typically classify countries into income categories. This classification is usually done by the World Bank.

2. **World Bank Classification**: The World Bank classifies countries into income groups based on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita. The categories are low-income, lower-middle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income.

3. **Recent Changes**: As of the latest updates, Turkey is classified by the World Bank as an upper-middle-income country, not a high-income country.

4. **Official Announcements**: There have been no recent announcements from the OECD or the World Bank indicating that Turkey has moved to the high-income category.

Given this information, the claim that the OECD announced 8 states, including Turkey, have moved from middle-income countries to high-income countries is not supported by the available data.

One such source is the World Internal Security and Police Index (WISPI) or similar global surveys conducted by organizations like Gallup.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2021, I do not have specific data from these sources that places Azerbaijan exactly in the 30th position for public confidence in the police. Rankings can vary year by year and depend on the methodology used by the survey or index.

1. **Initial Debt in 2002**: $130 billion
2. **Debt in the first half of 2016**: $421.4 billion

To calculate the percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Final Value} - \text{Initial Value}}{\text{Initial Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{421.4 - 130}{130} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{291.4}{130} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} \approx 224.92\% \]

The claim states that Turkey's foreign debt increased by 225.2 percent, which is very close to the calculated 224.92 percent. Given the slight rounding difference, the claim is quite accurate.

G20's development target is 2 percent and Türkiye is growing 5 percent,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""G20's development target is 2 percent and Türkiye is growing 5 percent,"" we need to verify two components:

1. The G20's development target.
2. Türkiye's current growth rate.

1. **G20's Development Target:**
   - The G20 does not have a single, fixed development target for economic growth. The G20 is a forum for international economic cooperation, and its member countries have various economic goals and targets. However, in 2014, the G20 set a collective goal to lift their GDP by an additional 2% over five years, but this was not a recurring or fixed target.

2. **Türkiye's Growth Rate:**
   - Türkiye's economic growth rate can vary significantly from year to year. According to recent data from the World Bank and other economic reports, Türkiye's GDP growth rate has fluctuated. For instance, in 2021, Türkiye's economy grew by approximately 11%, but growth rates can change based on various economic conditions.

Given the information:

- The G20 does not have a fixed 2% development target.
- Türkiye's growth rate has been higher than 2% in recent years, but the specific 5% figure would need to be verified against the most recent data.

Based on these points, the claim is not entirely accurate.

1. The increase in the labor force in the country in question over the last 10 years.
2. The total labor force of the 28 European Union (EU) members.

First, let's consider the increase in the labor force in the country. The claim states that the labor force has increased by 7 million 775 thousand people over the last 10 years. This figure would need to be verified with official labor statistics from the country's relevant labor or statistical department.

Second, let's look at the total labor force of the 28 EU members. According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, the total labor force of the EU-28 (before Brexit, which included the UK) was approximately 241 million people as of recent years. This is significantly higher than the 7 million 842 thousand figure mentioned in the claim.

"In Turkey, teachers are sentenced to a fee below the poverty limit.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Turkey, teachers are sentenced to a fee below the poverty limit,"" we need to examine the current salary levels of teachers in Turkey and compare them to the poverty threshold in the country.

1. **Teacher Salaries in Turkey**: According to various sources, including government reports and teacher unions, the average salary of a public school teacher in Turkey can vary based on experience, location, and additional qualifications. As of recent data, the starting salary for a teacher is around 5,000 to 6,000 Turkish Lira per month, with experienced teachers earning more.

2. **Poverty Threshold in Turkey**: The poverty line in Turkey is often calculated based on the minimum cost of living for a family. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and other economic research organizations, the poverty line for a family of four is estimated to be around 10,000 to 12,000 Turkish Lira per month.

3. **Comparison**: If we compare the starting salary of a teacher (5,000 to 6,000 TL) to the poverty line for a family of four (10,000 to 12,000 TL), it appears that a single teacher's salary is below the poverty line for a family. However, this does not necessarily mean that the salary is below the poverty line for an individual, as the poverty line for a single person would be lower.

Given this information, the claim that teachers are ""sentenced to a fee below the poverty limit"" is somewhat exaggerated but has a basis in the fact that a single teacher's salary may not be sufficient to support a family above the poverty line.

1. **Time Frame**: The claim does not specify a particular time frame. ""Over the years"" is vague and could mean different periods for different people. For a meaningful analysis, we would need to know the specific years being compared.

2. **Economic Context**: Economic growth, inflation, and other macroeconomic factors can significantly impact salaries and pensions. For example, in some countries, hyperinflation could lead to salaries and pensions increasing more than ten times over a short period, while in others, such increases might take decades.

3. **Geographical Context**: The claim does not specify a country or region. Economic conditions vary widely across different parts of the world. In some developing countries, rapid economic growth might lead to significant increases in salaries and pensions, while in more stable economies, such increases might be less dramatic.

4. **Data and Evidence**: Without specific data or evidence to support the claim, it is challenging to verify its accuracy. Historical data on salaries and pensions would be necessary to make a definitive judgment.

2. Türkiye's ranking in terms of national income per capita.

1. **Purchasing Power**: According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Türkiye is often ranked around the 13th largest economy in the world when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). This part of the claim is generally accurate.

2. **National Income Per Capita**: National income per capita rankings can vary depending on the source and the specific metrics used (e.g., GDP per capita, GNI per capita). According to the World Bank and IMF data, Türkiye's ranking in terms of GDP per capita (PPP) is typically much lower than its overall economy size ranking. It is often found around the 60th to 70th position, which aligns with the claim of being 64th.

Given that the first part of the claim is accurate and the second part is also reasonably accurate, the overall claim is mostly true. However, the statement that the 64th position ""does not reflect the truth"" is subjective and not a factual assertion that can be verified.

1. **Current Young Unemployment Rate**: If the current young unemployment rate is indeed 27.4%, this would need to be verified against the latest TURKSTAT reports.
2. **Unprecedented Rate**: To claim that this rate is unprecedented, we would need historical data from TURKSTAT showing that no previous young unemployment rate has been this high.
3. **Highest Rate**: This point suggests that young unemployment is higher than any other unemployment rate recorded by TURKSTAT, including general unemployment.

"When the Justice and Development Party arrived, the “Trust to the Judiciary” index, which was 52 percent, has currently fell to 14 percent.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""When the Justice and Development Party arrived, the 'Trust to the Judiciary' index, which was 52 percent, has currently fallen to 14 percent,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The initial trust level in the judiciary when the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power.
2. The current trust level in the judiciary.
3. The sources of these statistics to ensure they are credible and accurately reflect the situation.

The Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in Turkey in 2002. According to various reports and surveys over the years, trust in the judiciary has fluctuated. However, specific and consistent data points from credible sources are necessary to confirm the exact percentages mentioned.

If we assume the claim is based on reliable data, it would mean:
- Trust in the judiciary was at 52% when AKP came to power in 2002.
- Trust in the judiciary has now fallen to 14%.

Without access to specific and verifiable data points from credible sources, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the exact percentages stated in the claim. However, there have been numerous reports and surveys indicating a significant decline in trust in the judiciary in Turkey over the years, particularly under the AKP's rule.

Given the general trend reported by various sources, the claim seems plausible but requires specific data for precise verification.

"Especially in the global crisis environment, many countries have reduced R & D expenditures, while our country continued to increase these expenditures while freezing these programs.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. Whether many countries have reduced R&D expenditures during a global crisis.
2. Whether the country in question has continued to increase R&D expenditures while freezing other programs.

### Point 1: Global R&D Expenditures During Crisis
Historically, during global crises such as economic recessions or pandemics, some countries do reduce their R&D expenditures as part of broader budget cuts. However, this is not universally true for all countries. Some nations may maintain or even increase their R&D spending to stimulate innovation and economic recovery.

### Point 2: Country-Specific R&D Expenditures
The claim states that ""our country"" (which is unspecified) continued to increase R&D expenditures while freezing other programs. This would require specific data from the country in question to verify. For instance, if the country is the United States, data from the National Science Foundation or other relevant bodies would be needed. If the country is another nation, similar national data sources would be required.

Without specific data on the country in question, it is challenging to definitively verify this part of the claim.

### Conclusion
Given the general trend that some countries do reduce R&D spending during crises but others do not, and without specific data on the country in question, the claim can be considered partially accurate but not universally true.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"As a result of twice a year in Azerbaijan, our country ranks first in the CIS on this indicator",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand what specific indicator is being referred to and whether Azerbaijan indeed ranks first in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) on that indicator due to an event or action that occurs twice a year.

The statement is vague and lacks specific details about the indicator in question. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to verify the claim accurately.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
Changes to the Tax Code will significantly reduce the tax burden of private sector workers,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Changes to the Tax Code will significantly reduce the tax burden of private sector workers,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Specific Changes to the Tax Code**: What are the exact changes being proposed or implemented? Are they aimed at reducing income tax rates, increasing deductions, or providing new credits specifically for private sector workers?

2. **Impact on Private Sector Workers**: How do these changes specifically affect private sector workers compared to other groups? Are the benefits substantial enough to be considered a significant reduction in their tax burden?

3. **Economic Context**: Are there other economic factors or changes in the tax code that might offset the benefits? For example, if the tax code changes also include reductions in deductions or credits that private sector workers commonly use, the net effect might be less significant.

4. **Expert Analysis and Data**: What do tax experts and economic analysts say about the impact of these changes? Are there studies or data that quantify the reduction in tax burden for private sector workers?

Without specific details about the changes to the tax code and their direct impact on private sector workers, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the changes are indeed designed to reduce the tax burden and there is credible evidence supporting this, we might lean towards a positive assessment.

Given the need for more specific information to make a precise determination, the most balanced assessment based on the general nature of the claim would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"The purchase price of the hazelnut is 5 dollars 13 years ago, while not even 2 dollars.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the information provided and compare it with historical data on hazelnut prices.

The claim states: ""The purchase price of the hazelnut is 5 dollars 13 years ago, while not even 2 dollars.""

1. **Price 13 Years Ago**: The claim suggests that the price of hazelnuts was 5 dollars 13 years ago.
2. **Current Price**: The claim implies that the current price is less than 2 dollars.

To verify this, we would need historical price data for hazelnuts from 13 years ago and current price data. However, without access to specific historical price data, we can make a general assessment based on known trends and market information.

- **Historical Trends**: Generally, agricultural commodity prices can fluctuate due to various factors such as supply, demand, weather conditions, and market dynamics. It is possible for prices to have been higher in the past and lower now, but specific data is needed for precise verification.

Given the lack of specific historical price data in this context, we can only make a general assessment based on the plausibility of the claim.

**Assessment**:
- The claim that the price was 5 dollars 13 years ago and is now less than 2 dollars seems unlikely without specific data to support it. Prices of agricultural commodities like hazelnuts typically do not show such drastic long-term decreases without significant market changes.

"8.6 million tons of plastic is produced annually in Turkey.In 2018, we imported 20 thousand tons of plastic waste per month.Only 1 %of them are recycled.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify each part of the statement:

1. ""8.6 million tons of plastic is produced annually in Turkey.""
2. ""In 2018, we imported 20 thousand tons of plastic waste per month.""
3. ""Only 1% of them are recycled.""

### Verification:

1. **Plastic Production in Turkey:**
   - According to various sources, Turkey is a significant producer of plastic, but the exact figure of 8.6 million tons annually needs to be verified from reliable sources such as industry reports or government statistics.

2. **Plastic Waste Import in 2018:**
   - Reports indicate that Turkey has been importing plastic waste, and the figure of 20 thousand tons per month in 2018 is consistent with some reports. This would total approximately 240 thousand tons for the year.

3. **Recycling Rate:**
   - The recycling rate of imported plastic waste in Turkey has been a point of concern. Various reports suggest that the recycling rate is low, but the exact figure of 1% seems extremely low and would need verification from credible sources.

### Conclusion:
Given the information available, the claim seems to have elements of truth but may not be entirely accurate in all details. The production figure and import rate seem plausible, but the recycling rate of 1% appears to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation.

"""Since the beginning of the year, 60,000 new jobs have been created""",true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Since the beginning of the year, 60,000 new jobs have been created,"" we would need to verify the data from a reliable source, such as government labor statistics or reports from reputable economic research organizations. Without access to this specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and up-to-date information from a reliable source, it could be considered 'True'. If the data is somewhat accurate but not entirely precise, it might be 'Mostly True'. If the claim is partially accurate but missing important context or details, it could be 'Half True'. If the claim is largely inaccurate but contains a small element of truth, it would be 'Mostly False'. If the claim is entirely inaccurate, it would be 'False'.

"Let's look at the president's budgets.Ahmet Necdet Sezer spent in 7 years 167.4 million pounds.Abdullah Gül spent 722 million pounds in 7 years.Erdogan, the money spent in 1.5 years 2 billion 800 million pounds.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the budget figures for each president mentioned: Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Abdullah Gül, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. 

1. **Ahmet Necdet Sezer**: Served as the President of Turkey from 2000 to 2007. The claim states he spent 167.4 million pounds over 7 years.
2. **Abdullah Gül**: Served as the President of Turkey from 2007 to 2014. The claim states he spent 722 million pounds over 7 years.
3. **Recep Tayyip Erdoğan**: Became President in 2014. The claim states he spent 2.8 billion pounds in 1.5 years.

To verify these figures, we would need access to official budget records or credible sources that detail the expenditures of the Turkish presidency during these periods. Without access to these specific records, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the exact numbers provided in the claim.

However, based on general knowledge and available public information, it is known that presidential expenditures have increased significantly over time, particularly under Erdoğan's administration, due to various factors including inflation, increased security measures, and expanded presidential activities.

Given the significant increase in the figures mentioned for Erdoğan compared to his predecessors, and assuming the general trend of increasing expenditures is accurate, the claim seems plausible but may be exaggerated or simplified.

**Assessment:**
- The figures for Sezer and Gül seem reasonable based on historical context.
- The figure for Erdoğan appears significantly higher, which aligns with reports of increased spending but may need further verification for exact accuracy.

**Conclusion:**
Without exact verification, the claim appears to be an oversimplification but generally aligns with the trend of increasing presidential expenditures.

Türkiye is a net importer country in legumes.,true,tr,"Final Answer: Mostly True

Explanation: Türkiye has a significant agricultural sector and produces a variety of legumes, including lentils, chickpeas, and beans. However, despite its production capabilities, Türkiye often imports legumes to meet domestic demand, especially for certain types of legumes or during periods of lower domestic production. Therefore, while Türkiye does produce legumes, it also relies on imports, making the claim ""Mostly True.""",,False,True
"In 2017, 12.7 billion pounds supported the agricultural sector;In the same period, the import of 8 products was paid 20.6 billion.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific figures mentioned for the agricultural sector support and the import costs of 8 products in 2017. This requires access to reliable data sources such as government reports, economic databases, or credible news articles from that period.

Without access to these specific data points, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general approach to how one might verify such a claim:

1. **Check Government Reports**: Look for official reports from the relevant agricultural or economic departments for the year 2017.
2. **Consult Economic Databases**: Use databases like the World Bank, FAO, or other reputable economic data sources.
3. **Review News Articles**: Look for news articles from 2017 that discuss agricultural support and import costs.

Given the lack of specific data verification in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure and nature of the claim, it appears to be a factual statement that could be verified with the right data.

Consumer loan is a bank credit card debt swamp.The number of citizens in the debt swamp is 5 million,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Consumer loan is a bank credit card debt swamp.""
2. ""The number of citizens in the debt swamp is 5 million.""

For the first part, the phrase ""bank credit card debt swamp"" is subjective and metaphorical. It suggests that consumer loans, particularly credit card debt, are problematic and difficult to manage for many people. While it's true that credit card debt can be a significant issue for many consumers, the term ""swamp"" is not a precise or universally accepted description. Therefore, this part of the claim is more opinion-based than factual.

For the second part, the number of citizens in the debt swamp being 5 million would require specific data to verify. According to various financial reports and studies, millions of Americans do carry credit card debt, but the exact number can vary. If recent data supports that approximately 5 million citizens are struggling significantly with credit card debt, this part could be accurate. However, without specific and current data, it's challenging to confirm this number precisely.

Given the subjective nature of the first part and the need for specific data for the second part, the overall claim cannot be fully verified as entirely true or false.

"The PKK, which you say does not leave a gun, has not been a bullet for two years.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The PKK, which you say does not leave a gun, has not been a bullet for two years,"" we need to consider the activities of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) over the specified period.

The PKK is a Kurdish militant and political organization that has been involved in an armed struggle against the Turkish state for several decades. The intensity of their activities can vary over time due to various factors, including ceasefires, peace talks, and military operations.

1. **Historical Context**: The PKK has been involved in numerous conflicts and has had periods of reduced activity, often due to ceasefires or strategic decisions.
2. **Recent Developments**: To verify the claim, we would need to look at reports from credible sources such as government statements, independent monitoring groups, and news reports over the past two years.

Given the nature of the PKK and the ongoing conflict, it is unlikely that the PKK has completely ceased all armed activities for a full two-year period. There may have been periods of reduced activity, but claiming that there has been no bullet fired for two years seems implausible without strong evidence.

I was acquitted in the European Court,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I was acquitted in the European Court,"" we need to consider the functions and jurisdiction of the European Court. There are two main courts associated with Europe: the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).

1. **European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)**: This court deals with violations of the European Convention on Human Rights. It does not conduct criminal trials or acquit individuals; it rules on whether a member state has violated the rights of an individual.

2. **Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)**: This court interprets EU law to ensure it is applied uniformly across EU member states. It does not conduct criminal trials or acquit individuals either; it deals with issues related to EU law and its application.

Given that neither of these courts conducts criminal trials or issues acquittals in the manner that national criminal courts do, the claim ""I was acquitted in the European Court"" is not accurate.

"In 2013, 325 people lost their lives in a year due to substance addiction and 5 out of these 325 people contain the age group under the age of 15.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. The total number of people who lost their lives due to substance addiction in 2013 is 325.
2. Out of these 325 people, 5 were under the age of 15.

Without access to specific data sources or reports from 2013, it is challenging to confirm the exact numbers. However, if we assume the numbers provided are accurate, the claim would be evaluated as follows:

- The claim states a specific number of total deaths (325) and a specific number of deaths in a particular age group (5 under the age of 15).
- If both numbers are correct, the claim would be 'True'.
- If one of the numbers is slightly off but generally accurate, the claim might be 'Mostly True'.
- If there is a significant discrepancy in the numbers, the claim could be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact numbers, I will base the evaluation on the assumption that the numbers provided are accurate.

"Since 2008, we have created 6 million new business areas in the world, while the decline of employment is experienced everywhere, while unemployment increased.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. The creation of 6 million new business areas since 2008.
2. The decline of employment and increase in unemployment globally.

### Point 1: Creation of 6 million new business areas since 2008
- This is a very specific claim and would require data from global business registries and economic reports. While new businesses are created regularly, the exact figure of 6 million new business areas is difficult to verify without specific sources.

### Point 2: Decline of employment and increase in unemployment globally
- Employment trends can vary significantly by region and over time. For example, the global financial crisis of 2008 did lead to increased unemployment in many parts of the world. However, since then, employment rates have fluctuated, with some regions experiencing recovery and growth while others may still face challenges.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the exact number of new business areas and the mixed trends in global employment and unemployment, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

"In every call, the Azerbaijani parliament changes about 40-50%",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In every call, the Azerbaijani parliament changes about 40-50%,"" we need to examine the historical data on parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan. The term ""call"" refers to the convocation or session of the parliament, which typically lasts for five years.

The Azerbaijani parliament, known as the Milli Majlis, has 125 members. If the claim is accurate, we would expect to see approximately 50 to 62.5 members being replaced in each election cycle.

Let's look at the recent parliamentary elections:

1. **2015 Parliamentary Elections**: In these elections, a significant number of new members were elected, but the exact percentage of change is not readily available in public sources.
2. **2020 Parliamentary Elections**: Reports indicate that there was a notable turnover, with many new faces entering the parliament. However, specific figures on the percentage of new members vary.

Given the available information, it is challenging to pinpoint an exact percentage without detailed election data. However, anecdotal evidence and some reports suggest that there is a considerable turnover, though it may not consistently reach the 40-50% range.

Based on this analysis, the claim seems to have some basis in reality but may not be entirely accurate in every election cycle.

China developed its economy during Coronavirus,false,az,"To evaluate the claim ""China developed its economy during Coronavirus,"" we need to consider the economic performance of China during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1. **Economic Growth**: China was one of the few major economies that reported positive GDP growth in 2020. According to official data, China's economy grew by 2.3% in 2020, while many other countries experienced contractions.

2. **Industrial Production and Exports**: China saw a quick recovery in industrial production and exports. The country capitalized on its early control of the virus to ramp up production and meet global demand for medical supplies and electronics.

3. **Government Measures**: The Chinese government implemented various fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate the economy, including infrastructure projects and support for businesses.

4. **Challenges**: Despite the growth, China faced challenges such as reduced consumer spending, disruptions in global supply chains, and geopolitical tensions.

Given these points, the claim that ""China developed its economy during Coronavirus"" is supported by evidence of economic growth and recovery measures, although it wasn't without challenges.

"(Refer to illegal immigrants) How far did he go from Turkey?It goes around a quarter of this every year, but when it is compared with the previous year, a serious decrease in the transition from Turkey to Europe",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the available data on illegal immigration from Turkey to Europe. The claim suggests that there is a significant decrease in the number of illegal immigrants transitioning from Turkey to Europe compared to the previous year.

1. **Data on Illegal Immigration**: According to various reports from organizations such as the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there have been fluctuations in the number of illegal immigrants from Turkey to Europe over the years. 

2. **Recent Trends**: In recent years, there have been periods where the number of illegal immigrants has decreased due to various factors such as stricter border controls, agreements between Turkey and the European Union, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. **Quarterly Comparison**: The claim mentions that the transition goes around a quarter of this every year, which implies a consistent pattern. However, the actual numbers can vary significantly based on geopolitical and socio-economic factors.

4. **Serious Decrease**: The term ""serious decrease"" is subjective, but if we look at specific data points, there have been years where the decrease is notable. For example, after the EU-Turkey deal in 2016, there was a significant drop in the number of illegal crossings.

Based on the information available, the claim that there is a serious decrease in the transition from Turkey to Europe compared to the previous year can be considered accurate to some extent, but it is important to note that the term ""serious decrease"" can be interpreted differently.

We were able to protect and increase our foreign exchange reserves in the most difficult years,mostly true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We were able to protect and increase our foreign exchange reserves in the most difficult years,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Data**: Review the historical data on foreign exchange reserves for the specific country in question during the ""most difficult years."" This would typically involve looking at central bank reports or international financial databases.

2. **Economic Context**: Understand what is meant by ""the most difficult years."" This could refer to periods of economic crisis, recession, or other significant financial challenges.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the foreign exchange reserves at the beginning and end of the specified period to see if there was indeed an increase.

4. **External Factors**: Consider any external factors that might have influenced the reserves, such as international aid, loans, or changes in trade balances.

Without specific data and context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made by a credible source and there is no immediate contradictory evidence, we might lean towards a cautious assessment.

I believe that there are many of our contractors in the world in the world.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I believe that there are many of our contractors in the world in the world,"" we need to break it down into two parts: the factual basis and the redundancy.

1. **Factual Basis**: The claim suggests that there are many contractors associated with the speaker's organization globally. Without specific data about the organization and its contractors, it's challenging to verify the exact number. However, if we assume the organization is large and operates internationally, it is plausible that they have many contractors worldwide.

2. **Redundancy**: The phrase ""in the world in the world"" is redundant and does not affect the factual accuracy of the claim but does impact its clarity.

Given the plausible nature of the claim about having many contractors globally, but considering the redundancy, the claim can be seen as generally accurate but poorly phrased.

222 Foreign Representative Turkey's most represented in the world 7. Great country Türkiye,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. ""222 Foreign Representative"" - This likely refers to the number of foreign missions (embassies, consulates, etc.) that Turkey has around the world. According to the latest available data, Turkey has a significant number of foreign missions, but the exact number can vary slightly depending on the source and the year of the data.

2. ""Turkey's most represented in the world"" - This suggests that Turkey has the highest number of foreign missions compared to any other country. However, countries like the United States, China, and France typically have more foreign missions than Turkey.

3. ""7. Great country Türkiye"" - This part of the claim is more subjective and does not provide a clear, verifiable statement. It seems to be an opinion rather than a factual assertion.

Given these points, the claim that Turkey is the most represented country in the world with 222 foreign missions is not accurate. While Turkey does have a large number of foreign missions, it is not the most represented country globally.

Minimum Wage has increased 5 Times Drying The Past 10 Years in Azerbaijan,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Minimum Wage has increased 5 Times During The Past 10 Years in Azerbaijan,"" we need to examine historical data on minimum wage changes in Azerbaijan over the past decade.

1. **2013-2014**: The minimum wage in Azerbaijan was 93.50 AZN.
2. **2014-2017**: The minimum wage increased to 105 AZN.
3. **2017-2018**: The minimum wage increased to 116 AZN.
4. **2019**: The minimum wage increased to 180 AZN in January and then to 250 AZN in September.
5. **2020-2023**: The minimum wage increased to 300 AZN in January 2020.

Based on this data, the minimum wage in Azerbaijan has indeed increased multiple times over the past 10 years. Specifically, it increased in 2014, 2017, twice in 2019, and in 2020. This totals to five distinct increases.

"When we came to power, Turkey ranks 26th in the World Economy League, now the 16th great economic power is the 6th great economic power of Europe.",mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify Turkey's economic rankings at two different points in time: when the current government came to power and the present day.

1. **When the current government came to power**: The Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in Turkey in 2002. At that time, Turkey's economy was indeed ranked around 26th in the world by GDP.

2. **Current ranking**: As of the most recent data, Turkey's economy is ranked around 19th in the world by nominal GDP according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. This is not 16th as claimed.

3. **European ranking**: In terms of Europe, Turkey is generally considered the 7th or 8th largest economy, not the 6th.

Given these points, the claim that Turkey is now the 16th largest economy in the world and the 6th largest in Europe is not accurate.

Discrimination Against homosexuals is not carried out by the Government,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Discrimination Against homosexuals is not carried out by the Government,"" we need to consider the context and the specific government in question, as practices and policies vary widely across different countries and regions.

1. **Countries with Progressive Policies**: In many Western countries, such as Canada, the United States, and much of Europe, there are laws and policies in place that protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination. These governments actively work to prevent discrimination against homosexuals, and in many cases, they promote equality and inclusion.

2. **Countries with Mixed Records**: Some countries have a mixed record where there might be legal protections in place, but societal attitudes and enforcement of these laws can be inconsistent. In these places, discrimination might still occur, but it is not officially sanctioned by the government.

3. **Countries with Repressive Policies**: In some countries, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, there are laws that criminalize homosexual behavior, and the government actively discriminates against LGBTQ+ individuals. In these regions, discrimination is not only carried out by the government but is often enshrined in law.

Given the global diversity in government policies and practices regarding LGBTQ+ rights, the claim cannot be universally true or false. However, if we consider the global context and the fact that there are still many governments that do actively discriminate against homosexuals, the claim leans more towards being inaccurate.

It seems to be a mix of statements about the situation with corn prices and input prices, but it is not coherent enough to be evaluated accurately. The phrase ""There is no situation to be called 'gospel'"" is ambiguous and doesn't provide a clear context. Additionally, the statement about input prices increasing by 100 percent and a 25 percent increase being a panacea is not logically consistent or clear.

Given the lack of clarity and coherence in the claim, it is difficult to determine its truthfulness.

"In 2002, the number of foreign partnerships in Turkey is 4,400 and today is around 60 thousand.This is an expression of trust in the investment environment in Turkey.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The number of foreign partnerships in Turkey in 2002 was 4,400.
2. The number of foreign partnerships in Turkey today is around 60,000.
3. The increase in foreign partnerships is an expression of trust in the investment environment in Turkey.

Based on available data:

1. According to the Turkish Ministry of Trade and other economic reports, the number of foreign partnerships in Turkey in 2002 was indeed around 4,400.
2. Recent data from the Turkish Ministry of Trade and other economic sources indicate that the number of foreign partnerships in Turkey has grown significantly and is currently around 60,000.
3. The increase in foreign partnerships can be interpreted as an expression of trust in the investment environment, although this is a subjective interpretation and can be influenced by various factors such as economic policies, market potential, and geopolitical considerations.

Given that the numerical data points are accurate and the interpretation is reasonable, the claim can be considered mostly accurate.

Civil and political rights are protected,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Civil and political rights are protected,"" it is essential to consider the context and the specific country or region in question. Civil and political rights include freedoms such as speech, assembly, and the right to a fair trial. The protection of these rights can vary significantly from one country to another.

In democratic countries with strong legal frameworks and independent judiciaries, civil and political rights are generally well-protected. Examples include countries like Canada, Germany, and Japan. In these contexts, the claim would be 'True' or 'Mostly True.'

However, in countries with authoritarian regimes, weak legal systems, or ongoing conflicts, civil and political rights may be frequently violated. Examples include North Korea, Syria, and some other countries where freedoms are severely restricted. In these contexts, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False.'

Given the variability across different regions and countries, a generalized statement about the protection of civil and political rights cannot be universally accurate without specifying the context.

"Industry, heavy industry, domestic industry ... Turkey does not produce, debt -based consumption.",false,tr,"To evaluate the claim ""Industry, heavy industry, domestic industry ... Turkey does not produce, debt-based consumption,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Industry and Production in Turkey**:
   - Turkey has a diverse industrial sector, including automotive, textiles, electronics, and machinery. The country is known for its significant production capabilities in these areas.
   - Heavy industry in Turkey includes steel production, shipbuilding, and defense manufacturing.
   - Domestic industry is also robust, with a variety of goods produced for both local consumption and export.

2. **Debt-Based Consumption**:
   - Turkey has faced economic challenges, including high levels of debt and inflation. Consumer debt and government borrowing have been significant issues.
   - However, the presence of debt does not negate the fact that Turkey has a productive industrial sector.

Given these points, the claim that ""Turkey does not produce"" is inaccurate, as Turkey does have substantial industrial production. However, the aspect of ""debt-based consumption"" has some validity due to the economic challenges the country faces.

"Our country still has not been able to reach the expected life expectancy of OECD countries at birth, and it is not expected to reach this form.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the following:

1. **Life Expectancy Data**: Compare the life expectancy at birth of the country in question with the average life expectancy at birth of OECD countries.
2. **Trends and Projections**: Look at the trends in life expectancy over recent years and any projections or forecasts for the future.

Without specific data on the country in question, I can provide a general approach:

- **OECD Average**: As of recent data, the average life expectancy at birth for OECD countries is around 80-82 years.
- **Country's Life Expectancy**: If the country's life expectancy is significantly lower than this average, the claim that it has not reached the expected life expectancy of OECD countries could be true.
- **Projections**: If there are no significant health policy changes, economic improvements, or other factors that could drastically improve life expectancy, the claim that it is not expected to reach the OECD average could also be true.

Given the general nature of the claim and without specific data, the most accurate assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"In the last 15 years, we have suffered from 30 percent of the loss of life in traffic accidents.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In the last 15 years, we have suffered from 30 percent of the loss of life in traffic accidents,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Time Frame**: The claim specifies a 15-year period.
2. **Percentage of Loss of Life**: The claim states that 30 percent of the loss of life in traffic accidents occurred during this period.

To evaluate this, we would need data on traffic accident fatalities over a longer historical period to compare the last 15 years against the total. Without specific data, it's challenging to verify the exact percentage.

However, if we assume the claim is trying to say that 30 percent of all traffic fatalities in history occurred in the last 15 years, this would be highly unlikely given the long history of motor vehicle use and the improvements in vehicle safety and traffic regulations over time.

Given the lack of specific data and the improbability of the claim based on general trends in traffic safety improvements, the claim seems exaggerated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
We do not see the increase in unemployment,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We do not see the increase in unemployment,"" we need to consider the context and the most recent data on unemployment rates. 

If the latest statistics from reliable sources such as government labor departments or reputable economic research organizations show that unemployment rates have remained stable or decreased, then the claim could be considered accurate. Conversely, if the data indicates an increase in unemployment rates, the claim would be inaccurate.

Without specific data, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is being made in a context where recent data shows no significant increase in unemployment, the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If there is some increase but it is not substantial, it might be 'Half True'. If there is a clear increase in unemployment, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I will make a reasoned assumption based on typical scenarios.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Has COVID-19 vaccinated?,false,az,"The claim 'Has COVID-19 vaccinated?' is not a coherent statement. It seems to be a grammatical error or a misunderstanding of how vaccination works. COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and it cannot be vaccinated. People can be vaccinated against COVID-19, but the disease itself cannot be vaccinated.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"Previously, around 11-12 million tourists came to the AK Party as a result of making the country brand 36 million.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. The number of tourists that came to Turkey before the AK Party's influence.
2. The number of tourists that came to Turkey as a result of the AK Party's efforts.

The AK Party (Justice and Development Party) came to power in Turkey in 2002. According to historical tourism data, Turkey saw around 11-12 million tourists annually in the early 2000s. By 2019, Turkey's tourism numbers had increased significantly, reaching approximately 45 million tourists.

The claim states that the AK Party's efforts resulted in making the country a brand that attracted 36 million tourists. While the exact number of 36 million is not entirely accurate, the general trend of a significant increase in tourism under the AK Party's governance is correct.

Given this context, the claim is somewhat accurate but not entirely precise in its numbers.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
"Participation in Bar Association elections is 40-5 %, around 50 %",false,tr,"To evaluate the claim ""Participation in Bar Association elections is 40-5 %, around 50 %,"" let's break it down:

1. The claim states that participation is ""40-5 %."" This seems to be a typographical error and likely meant to be ""40-50 %.""
2. The claim then states ""around 50 %.""

If we interpret the claim as ""Participation in Bar Association elections is 40-50 %, around 50 %,"" it suggests that the participation rate is within the range of 40% to 50%, and this range is close to 50%.

Given that 40-50% is indeed close to 50%, the claim can be considered accurate in its context.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"With the project that will give life to Cyprus, we will meet the whole drinking water needs of the TRNC by 2050.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Project Details**: The project referred to is likely the ""Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project,"" which aims to transfer water from Turkey to Northern Cyprus via an undersea pipeline. This project was completed in 2015 and is designed to supply drinking and irrigation water to Northern Cyprus.

2. **Capacity and Sustainability**: The project's capacity is to deliver approximately 75 million cubic meters of water annually. This amount is intended to meet the drinking water needs of Northern Cyprus, which has faced water scarcity issues.

3. **Projections and Assumptions**: The claim projects that the water needs of the TRNC (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) will be met until 2050. This assumes that the population growth, water consumption rates, and infrastructure will remain manageable within the project's capacity.

4. **Potential Challenges**: Long-term sustainability could be affected by factors such as maintenance of the pipeline, political issues, climate change, and unforeseen increases in water demand.

Given the current capacity and the successful implementation of the project, it is reasonable to state that the project is designed to meet the drinking water needs of the TRNC. However, projecting this capability until 2050 involves assumptions that may or may not hold true over time.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"We are the number one natural gas consumer of Russia.Türkiye, if necessary, natural gas can go to the way of providing many different places.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. Whether Türkiye is the number one natural gas consumer of Russia.
2. Whether Türkiye has the capability to source natural gas from many different places if necessary.

1. **Türkiye as the number one natural gas consumer of Russia:**
   - As of recent data, the largest consumers of Russian natural gas are typically European countries such as Germany, Italy, and Turkey. While Turkey is a significant consumer, it is not the largest. Germany has historically been the largest importer of Russian natural gas.

2. **Türkiye's ability to source natural gas from different places:**
   - Türkiye has been diversifying its natural gas supply sources. It imports natural gas from various countries, including Azerbaijan, Iran, and through LNG (liquefied natural gas) from countries like the United States, Qatar, and others. This indicates that Türkiye has the capability to source natural gas from multiple suppliers.

Given these points, the claim that Türkiye is the number one natural gas consumer of Russia is not accurate, but the part about Türkiye being able to source natural gas from different places is true.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Barmek Had Completely Destroyed The Management of The Energy Sector,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Barmek Had Completely Destroyed The Management of The Energy Sector,"" we need to consider the context and evidence surrounding Barmek's involvement in the energy sector.

Barmek Holding, a Turkish company, was involved in the management of electricity distribution in certain regions, such as Azerbaijan, in the early 2000s. There were various reports and controversies regarding their management practices, including allegations of mismanagement and corruption. However, saying that Barmek ""completely destroyed"" the management of the energy sector is a very strong and absolute statement.

To evaluate this claim, we would need to look at specific evidence of the extent of the damage caused by Barmek's management. If there were significant issues but not a total collapse, the claim would be exaggerated. If the energy sector continued to function, albeit poorly, the claim would be even less accurate.

Given the information available, it is likely that while Barmek's management may have had significant negative impacts, it is an overstatement to say they ""completely destroyed"" the management of the energy sector.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
"I look at the performance of the last 15 years, as in every field, we have grown 3-4 times in the field of agriculture.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""in the last 15 years, we have grown 3-4 times in the field of agriculture,"" we need to examine data on agricultural growth over that period. This includes metrics such as crop production, yield per hectare, agricultural GDP, and other relevant indicators.

1. **Crop Production**: Data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other agricultural databases can provide insights into the growth in crop production. If major crops have seen a 3-4 times increase in production, this would support the claim.

2. **Yield per Hectare**: Improvements in agricultural practices, technology, and inputs can lead to higher yields. If yields have increased significantly, this would also support the claim.

3. **Agricultural GDP**: The contribution of agriculture to the overall GDP can indicate growth. A 3-4 times increase in agricultural GDP would be a strong indicator of substantial growth.

4. **Other Indicators**: Factors such as the adoption of new technologies, expansion of arable land, and improvements in irrigation and infrastructure can also contribute to growth.

Based on available data, agricultural growth rates vary significantly by region and crop type. While some areas and crops may have experienced substantial growth, a 3-4 times increase across the entire agricultural sector over 15 years is quite ambitious and less likely to be uniformly true.

Given the complexity and variability in agricultural growth, the claim seems to be an overstatement when considering the entire sector globally or even within a specific country.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Presidential Administration Has Been Formed in A Completely New Composition,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Presidential Administration Has Been Formed in A Completely New Composition,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of the situation. 

1. **Completely New Composition**: This phrase implies that every single member of the presidential administration is new, with no holdovers from the previous administration.

2. **Verification**: To verify this, we would need to look at the list of the current administration's members and compare it to the previous administration's list. If every position has been filled by a new individual, the claim would be true. If even one person from the previous administration remains, the claim would be false.

Without specific details or a list to compare, we can only make a general assessment based on typical practices. It is rare for an entire administration to be completely new, as some continuity is often maintained for stability and expertise.

Given the typical practices and without specific evidence to the contrary:

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"China, one -third of Israel's exports, while creating high -tech products, in our exports, the proportion of high -tech products is not even five percent",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""China, one-third of Israel's exports"": This part of the claim suggests that China accounts for one-third of Israel's exports. According to data from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics and other trade reports, China is a significant trading partner for Israel, but it does not account for one-third of Israel's exports. The United States and the European Union are typically larger markets for Israeli exports. Therefore, this part of the claim is likely exaggerated.

2. ""While creating high-tech products, in our exports, the proportion of high-tech products is not even five percent"": Israel is known for its high-tech industry, and high-tech products constitute a significant portion of its exports. According to various economic reports, high-tech products make up a substantial percentage of Israel's exports, often cited to be around 40-50%. Therefore, the claim that high-tech products are less than five percent of Israel's exports is inaccurate.

Given the inaccuracies in both parts of the claim, the overall statement is not supported by the available data.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Azerbaijan is Always invited to organizations Like the Shanghai Cooperation and G20,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan is always invited to organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation and G20,"" we need to examine Azerbaijan's involvement with these specific organizations.

1. **Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)**: Azerbaijan is not a full member of the SCO. The SCO primarily consists of countries from Central Asia, China, and Russia. Azerbaijan has participated in some SCO activities and meetings as a guest or observer, but it is not a regular or permanent invitee.

2. **G20**: The G20 is a group of the world's largest economies, and Azerbaijan is not a member. The G20 includes countries like the United States, China, Germany, and others. Azerbaijan has not been a regular invitee to G20 meetings. Occasionally, non-member countries are invited to specific G20 summits, but this is not a consistent or guaranteed invitation.

Given this information, the claim that Azerbaijan is ""always invited"" to these organizations is not accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Social assistance from 2 billion pounds annually to 38 billion pounds.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Social assistance from 2 billion pounds annually to 38 billion pounds,"" we need to consider the context, time frame, and source of the data. Without specific details on the period over which this increase occurred or the exact nature of the social assistance programs being referenced, it is challenging to verify the claim definitively.

However, if we assume the claim is referring to a significant increase in social assistance spending over a certain period, it is plausible that such an increase could occur due to various factors such as inflation, policy changes, or increased demand for social services.

Given the lack of specific details and context, it is difficult to fully verify the claim. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
There are nearly 500 patients in prisons,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There are nearly 500 patients in prisons,"" we need to consider the context and available data. The term ""patients"" in this context likely refers to inmates receiving medical or mental health care within the prison system.

Given that the number of inmates receiving medical or mental health care can vary widely depending on the country, state, or specific prison system, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer without more specific information. However, in many prison systems, the number of inmates receiving medical or mental health care is often much higher than 500.

For example, in the United States, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and state prison systems collectively house hundreds of thousands of inmates, many of whom require medical or mental health care. Therefore, the claim that there are ""nearly 500 patients in prisons"" seems to significantly underestimate the actual number.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The UN report includes a group of Azerbaijani states in Azerbaijan,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The UN report includes a group of Azerbaijani states in Azerbaijan,"" we need to analyze the specific details and context.

1. **UN Reports**: The United Nations publishes various reports on different topics, including human rights, development, and geopolitical issues. These reports can include information about countries and regions.

2. **Azerbaijani States**: Azerbaijan is a country in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. It is divided into administrative divisions, including districts (rayons) and cities. The term ""Azerbaijani states"" is not a standard term used to describe these administrative divisions.

3. **Contextual Accuracy**: If the claim refers to administrative divisions within Azerbaijan, it might be a misinterpretation or misstatement. The UN might refer to regions, districts, or areas within Azerbaijan, but not typically as ""Azerbaijani states.""

Given these points, the claim seems to be inaccurately phrased and does not align with standard terminology or the typical content of UN reports.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"Our bilateral trade volume, which was around 154 million dollars in 2017, has exceeded $ 1 billion in the first 9 months of 2018.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific figures for bilateral trade volume between the two entities in question for the years 2017 and the first 9 months of 2018. 

1. **2017 Trade Volume**: The claim states that the bilateral trade volume was around 154 million dollars in 2017.
2. **2018 Trade Volume**: The claim states that the trade volume exceeded $1 billion in the first 9 months of 2018.

Without access to the specific trade data from reliable sources such as government trade reports, international trade databases, or credible news articles, it is not possible to definitively verify the accuracy of these figures.

However, if we assume the data provided in the claim is accurate, the statement would be 'True'. If there is any discrepancy in the figures, the accuracy would vary accordingly.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. 

Final Answer: **Unable to determine**",,False,True
"How there is unemployment in Turkey, more unemployment than Turkey is in Germany, England, Spain.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that there is more unemployment in Turkey than in Germany, England, and Spain, we need to look at the most recent unemployment statistics from reliable sources such as the World Bank, International Labour Organization (ILO), or national statistical agencies.

As of the latest available data:

1. **Turkey**: The unemployment rate in Turkey has been relatively high in recent years. For instance, in 2022, it was around 11-12%.

2. **Germany**: Germany typically has a low unemployment rate. In 2022, it was around 3-4%.

3. **England (United Kingdom)**: The UK, including England, also has a relatively low unemployment rate. In 2022, it was around 4-5%.

4. **Spain**: Spain has had a high unemployment rate compared to other European countries. In 2022, it was around 13-14%.

Based on these figures, Turkey's unemployment rate is indeed higher than that of Germany and the UK, but it is lower than Spain's.

They looked at how much foreign exchange reserves in the countries of the countries for every $ 100 external debt.16 dollars in Turkey.Turkey is the least money in the safe according to its debt.(In developing market economies),true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific data regarding Turkey's foreign exchange reserves relative to its external debt, especially in comparison to other developing market economies.

1. **Foreign Exchange Reserves**: These are assets held by a central bank in foreign currencies, which can include bonds, treasury bills, and other government securities.

2. **External Debt**: This is the total debt a country owes to foreign creditors.

3. **Developing Market Economies**: These are nations with social or business activity in the process of rapid growth and industrialization. 

The claim states that Turkey has $16 in foreign exchange reserves for every $100 of external debt, and that this is the lowest among developing market economies.

To verify this:
- We need the latest data on Turkey's foreign exchange reserves and external debt.
- We need to compare this ratio with other developing market economies.

As of the latest available data:
- Turkey's foreign exchange reserves have been reported to be relatively low compared to its external debt.
- Various financial reports and analyses have indicated that Turkey's reserves are indeed among the lowest when compared to its external debt in the context of developing market economies.

Given this context, the claim appears to be supported by available data.

"You know from the sea under the sea in Istanbul, we have made Marmaray, we are the ones who do this.Neither Demirel, nor Ecevit have no contribution to this.",mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. **""You know from the sea under the sea in Istanbul, we have made Marmaray""**:
   - The Marmaray project is indeed a rail transport project in Istanbul that includes an undersea tunnel connecting the European and Asian parts of the city. This part of the claim is accurate.

2. **""We are the ones who do this""**:
   - The Marmaray project was completed and inaugurated during the tenure of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) under the leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. This part of the claim is also accurate.

3. **""Neither Demirel, nor Ecevit have no contribution to this""**:
   - Süleyman Demirel and Bülent Ecevit were prominent Turkish politicians who served as Prime Ministers and Presidents in earlier decades. The Marmaray project was conceptualized and initial feasibility studies were conducted during their times, but the actual construction and completion of the project occurred much later, under the AKP government. Therefore, while they may have had some early involvement in the conceptual stages, they did not contribute to the actual construction and completion of the project.

Given these points, the claim is mostly accurate but slightly dismissive of the early conceptual contributions of previous leaders.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Our Hatay is one of the top 5 cities in Turkey during the period of our government.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Our Hatay is one of the top 5 cities in Turkey during the period of our government,"" we need to consider various factors such as economic performance, quality of life, infrastructure development, and other relevant metrics.

1. **Economic Performance**: Hatay's economic performance can be measured by its GDP, industrial output, and employment rates. Comparing these metrics with other major cities like Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa, and Antalya is essential.

2. **Quality of Life**: This includes healthcare, education, public services, and overall living standards. Again, comparing Hatay to other leading cities in Turkey is necessary.

3. **Infrastructure Development**: This includes transportation, urban development, and public amenities. 

4. **Government Period**: The specific period of the government in question should be identified to compare the progress made during that time.

Without specific data and a clear definition of what ""top 5 cities"" entails, it is challenging to definitively categorize Hatay as one of the top 5 cities in Turkey. Generally, cities like Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa, and Antalya are more frequently recognized as the top cities in Turkey based on various metrics.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Türkiye is importing live animals and meat after 16 years.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Türkiye is importing live animals and meat after 16 years,"" we need to verify the historical context and current status of Türkiye's import practices regarding live animals and meat.

1. **Historical Context**: Türkiye has had periods where it restricted or banned the import of live animals and meat to protect local producers and manage health concerns. However, these restrictions have not been consistently in place for 16 years without interruption.

2. **Current Status**: Recent reports and data indicate that Türkiye has been importing live animals and meat in recent years, especially to meet domestic demand and manage prices. For example, Türkiye has imported livestock from countries like Brazil, Uruguay, and others in the past decade.

Given this information, the claim that Türkiye is importing live animals and meat after 16 years is not accurate. The country has engaged in such imports within the last 16 years.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
Are The President's Words About The APF-Musavat Duo True?,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Are The President's Words About The APF-Musavat Duo True?"", we would need to evaluate the specific statements made by the President regarding the APF-Musavat duo. This involves fact-checking the context, content, and evidence supporting or refuting the President's statements.

Without specific details about what the President said, it is impossible to accurately categorize the claim. Therefore, more information is needed to make a definitive judgment.

Final Answer: Insufficient Information",,False,True
Nüfusun yüzde 50’si kendi seçtiği belediye başkanı tarafından yönetilmiyor.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Nüfusun yüzde 50’si kendi seçtiği belediye başkanı tarafından yönetilmiyor,"" we need to consider the context and the data available regarding the governance of municipalities in Turkey.

1. **Context**: This claim suggests that half of the population is not governed by the mayor they elected. This could imply that appointed trustees or other forms of administrative intervention are in place instead of the elected mayors.

2. **Data**: In recent years, especially after the 2019 local elections in Turkey, there have been instances where elected mayors, particularly from opposition parties, were replaced by government-appointed trustees. This has been notably prevalent in certain regions, such as the southeastern part of Turkey.

3. **Verification**: To verify this claim, one would need to look at the number of municipalities where elected mayors have been replaced by trustees and compare the population of these municipalities to the total population of Turkey.

Given the information available up to 2023, it is known that a significant number of municipalities, especially in the southeastern regions, have had their elected mayors replaced by trustees. However, whether this accounts for exactly 50% of the population is debatable and would require precise statistical data.

Considering the general trend and the significant number of interventions, but without exact figures to confirm the 50% threshold, the claim can be considered as having a substantial basis but not definitively proven to be exactly 50%.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
"Education alone does not mean anything to prevent violence against women.As the collection increases, the dose of the beating increases",false,tr,"To evaluate the claim ""Education alone does not mean anything to prevent violence against women. As the collection increases, the dose of the beating increases,"" we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Education alone does not mean anything to prevent violence against women.""
2. ""As the collection increases, the dose of the beating increases.""

### Part 1: ""Education alone does not mean anything to prevent violence against women.""
- **Analysis**: Education is a significant factor in preventing violence against women, but it is not the only factor. Other elements such as cultural norms, legal frameworks, economic conditions, and social support systems also play crucial roles. Therefore, while education is important, it alone may not be sufficient to prevent violence against women.

### Part 2: ""As the collection increases, the dose of the beating increases.""
- **Analysis**: This part of the claim is more ambiguous and seems to suggest a correlation between some form of ""collection"" (possibly referring to wealth, possessions, or dowry) and an increase in violence. There is some evidence that economic stress and disputes over financial matters can contribute to domestic violence, but this statement is overly simplistic and does not account for the complexity of the issue.

### Conclusion:
- The first part of the claim has some validity but is an oversimplification.
- The second part of the claim is vague and lacks clear evidence to support a direct correlation.

Given these points, the overall claim is an oversimplification and does not fully capture the complexities involved in preventing violence against women.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"In almost all developing countries in the world, the foreign exchange has been seriously moving, the dollar began to rise.In this sense, Türkiye is one of the countries that rise at a reasonable level of exchange rates",half true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the recent trends in foreign exchange rates, particularly the performance of the Turkish lira (TRY) against the US dollar (USD).

1. **Global Context**: It is true that in many developing countries, the value of their currencies has been fluctuating, often depreciating against the US dollar due to various economic factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, and geopolitical uncertainties.

2. **Türkiye's Situation**: The Turkish lira has experienced significant depreciation against the US dollar over the past few years. Factors contributing to this include high inflation rates, political instability, and economic policies that have sometimes been viewed as unorthodox by international investors.

3. **Reasonable Level of Exchange Rates**: The term ""reasonable level"" is subjective. However, if we interpret it as a stable or less volatile exchange rate compared to other developing countries, the data does not support this. The Turkish lira has been one of the more volatile and depreciating currencies among developing nations.

Given these points, the claim that Türkiye is one of the countries that rise at a reasonable level of exchange rates is not supported by the recent performance of the Turkish lira.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Türkiye is among the countries that pollute the world at least.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye is among the countries that pollute the world at least,"" we need to consider various metrics of pollution, such as greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, waste management, and other environmental indicators.

1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: According to data from the Global Carbon Atlas and other sources, Türkiye is not among the top emitters of CO2 per capita, but it is also not among the lowest. Türkiye's total CO2 emissions are significant due to its population and industrial activities.

2. **Air Quality**: Türkiye has faced challenges with air quality, particularly in urban areas. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that air pollution levels in some Turkish cities exceed recommended limits.

3. **Waste Management**: Türkiye has made progress in waste management, but it still faces issues with recycling rates and waste disposal practices compared to some other countries.

4. **Environmental Policies**: Türkiye has been making efforts to improve its environmental policies and reduce pollution, but it still has a long way to go to be considered among the least polluting countries.

Given these points, while Türkiye is not among the worst polluters, it is also not among the countries that pollute the least. Therefore, the claim is an overstatement.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"They said, 'We will increase employment', they broke the unemployment record.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two key points:

1. **Promise to Increase Employment**: Did the entity in question (likely a government or organization) make a promise to increase employment?
2. **Unemployment Record**: Did the same entity subsequently break the unemployment record, implying that unemployment reached its highest level despite their promise?

If both points are verified as true, the claim would be 'True'. If the promise was made but the unemployment record was not broken, or if the record was broken but no such promise was made, the claim would be 'False'. If there is some truth to both points but with significant nuances or exceptions, the claim could fall into one of the intermediate categories.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure of the statement, it suggests a contradiction between the promise and the outcome.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
One out of every four young university graduates is unemployed.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""One out of every four young university graduates is unemployed,"" we need to consider the most recent and reliable data on unemployment rates among young university graduates. This data can vary by country, region, and over time.

1. **Data Source**: The claim should be verified against reputable sources such as government labor statistics, reports from international organizations like the International Labour Organization (ILO), or research studies from credible institutions.

2. **Definition of Terms**: 
   - ""Young"" typically refers to individuals in the age range of 20-24 or 25-29, but this can vary.
   - ""University graduates"" refers to individuals who have completed a university degree.
   - ""Unemployed"" means actively seeking work but unable to find employment.

3. **Recent Trends**: 
   - In many developed countries, the unemployment rate for young university graduates tends to be lower than for those without a degree, but it can still be significant.
   - In some regions, especially those with economic challenges, the unemployment rate for young graduates can be higher.

4. **Example Data**:
   - According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for recent college graduates (ages 20-24) was around 6-7% in recent years, which is much lower than 25%.
   - In the European Union, Eurostat data shows varying rates, but generally, the unemployment rate for young graduates is also below 25%.

Given this context, the claim that ""One out of every four young university graduates is unemployed"" (which implies a 25% unemployment rate) seems to be an overstatement for most developed regions. However, it might be closer to reality in specific countries or regions facing severe economic issues.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
98% of the population does not believe in inflation in the remaining period of the year,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""98% of the population does not believe in inflation in the remaining period of the year,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of the Claim**: Is there a credible source or survey that supports this statistic? Without a reliable source, the claim's validity is questionable.
2. **Population Sample**: Does the claim refer to a specific population (e.g., a country, a region) or the global population? The context matters significantly.
3. **Belief in Inflation**: Belief in inflation can be subjective and influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, media reports, and personal experiences.

Given the lack of specific context, credible sources, and detailed information to support this claim, it is highly unlikely that such a precise and sweeping statement can be accurately made about the beliefs of 98% of any population.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
We are currently getting about 50 thousand barrels of oil from the wells in the country.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are currently getting about 50 thousand barrels of oil from the wells in the country,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Current Data**: The most recent and reliable data on oil production in the country in question.
2. **Context**: The specific country being referred to, as oil production rates vary significantly from one country to another.
3. **Source Verification**: Whether the claim is backed by credible sources such as government reports, industry publications, or reputable news outlets.

Without specific information about the country and the latest production figures, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the country in question is a minor oil producer, 50 thousand barrels per day could be plausible. For major oil-producing countries, this figure would be significantly lower than their actual production rates.

Given the lack of specific context and data, the claim could be considered somewhat ambiguous but not entirely implausible.

"As of now, the share of electronic commerce in the world is at 16 percent in China, 6-7 percent in developing countries and 1.5 percent in Turkey.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the current statistics on the share of electronic commerce in China, developing countries, and Turkey. 

1. **China**: As of recent data, China is known to have a significant share of global e-commerce. According to various reports, China's e-commerce market share is indeed substantial, often cited around 16% or higher of the global e-commerce market.

2. **Developing Countries**: The share of e-commerce in developing countries can vary widely. However, a range of 6-7% seems plausible given the rapid growth in regions like Southeast Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa.

3. **Turkey**: Turkey's e-commerce market has been growing, but it is still relatively small compared to more developed markets. A figure of 1.5% seems reasonable based on available data.

Given these points, the claim appears to be consistent with available data.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
The Central Bank gave the highest interest in its history.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Central Bank gave the highest interest in its history,"" we need to consider historical data on interest rates set by the Central Bank in question. Central Banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, have historical records of interest rates that can be compared to the current rate to verify this claim.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume the claim is about a well-known central bank like the Federal Reserve, we can reference historical interest rate data. For example, the Federal Reserve's highest interest rate was around 20% in the early 1980s.

If the current interest rate set by the Central Bank is lower than this historical peak, the claim would be 'False'. If it is indeed the highest ever recorded, the claim would be 'True'.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on historical trends and typical interest rate levels in recent years, it is unlikely that the current rate is the highest in history.

"In Turkey, we have a disabled citizen who can work close to 1 million 850 thousand today.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In Turkey, we have a disabled citizen who can work close to 1 million 850 thousand today,"" we need to verify the number of disabled individuals in Turkey who are capable of working.

As of the latest available data, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and other relevant sources provide information on the population of disabled individuals and their employment status. However, specific numbers can vary based on the definitions and criteria used for disability and employment.

Given the complexity and the need for precise and up-to-date data, it is essential to cross-check with the most recent and reliable sources. If the claim aligns closely with the latest statistics, it could be considered accurate.

Without access to the most recent and specific data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on available information, the number of disabled individuals in Turkey who are capable of working is likely to be in the range mentioned.

(Between 2010-2014)… There was an increase in mortality rate in state hospitals by 40 percent.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Between 2010-2014… There was an increase in mortality rate in state hospitals by 40 percent,"" we need to verify the following:

1. **Time Frame**: The period between 2010 and 2014.
2. **Location**: State hospitals.
3. **Metric**: Mortality rate.
4. **Change**: An increase of 40 percent.

Without access to specific data from state hospitals during this period, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and reliable data sources, we can analyze the plausibility.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, we can only assess it based on the information provided. If the claim is based on a credible source, it could be considered accurate. However, without concrete evidence, we cannot definitively state its truthfulness.

The share of manufacturing industry in the gross national product fell from 23 percent to 15 percent.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The share of manufacturing industry in the gross national product fell from 23 percent to 15 percent,"" we would need to verify the specific data points and the time period referenced. This involves checking historical economic data from reliable sources such as government reports, economic research institutions, or reputable financial databases.

Without access to the specific data and time period, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide a general assessment based on trends observed in many developed economies over recent decades. In many developed countries, the share of manufacturing in the gross national product (GNP) has indeed declined as economies have shifted towards services and technology sectors. A drop from 23 percent to 15 percent is plausible within this context.

Given the general trend but without specific data verification:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"With 4 percent growth, we grew more than twice the average of developing countries except China and India.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare the 4 percent growth rate to the average growth rate of developing countries, excluding China and India.

1. **Identify the average growth rate of developing countries excluding China and India**: According to data from sources like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the average growth rate of developing countries can be found. For instance, if the average growth rate of developing countries (excluding China and India) is around 2 percent, then a 4 percent growth rate would indeed be more than twice the average.

2. **Verify the specific growth rates**: If the average growth rate of developing countries excluding China and India is significantly different from 2 percent, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Given that the claim states ""we grew more than twice the average of developing countries except China and India,"" and assuming the average growth rate of these countries is around 2 percent, the claim would be accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
Air Pollution in Bursa 10 times the world health organization limits ...,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Air Pollution in Bursa is 10 times the World Health Organization (WHO) limits,"" we need to compare the air pollution levels in Bursa with the WHO guidelines.

The WHO has set guidelines for various pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3). For instance, the WHO guideline for PM2.5 is an annual mean of 5 µg/m³ and a 24-hour mean of 15 µg/m³.

To verify the claim, we would need specific data on the air pollution levels in Bursa. If recent measurements show that the levels of any of these pollutants are indeed 10 times higher than the WHO limits, the claim would be true. However, without specific data, we cannot definitively confirm or refute the claim.

Given the lack of specific data in the provided information, we cannot accurately assess the claim. Therefore, the most appropriate response based on the available information is:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"As a year in which 2014 stagnation, inflation, unemployment and debts climb ...",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that in 2014 there was stagnation, inflation, unemployment, and climbing debts, we need to look at the economic data from that year.

1. **Stagnation**: Economic stagnation refers to a prolonged period of slow economic growth. In 2014, the global economy experienced varied growth rates. The U.S. economy, for example, saw a GDP growth rate of around 2.4%, which is moderate but not indicative of stagnation. However, some regions, like the Eurozone, did experience slower growth.

2. **Inflation**: Inflation rates in 2014 were relatively low in many advanced economies. For instance, the U.S. had an inflation rate of about 1.6%, which is below the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. The Eurozone also experienced low inflation, with some countries even facing deflationary pressures.

3. **Unemployment**: Unemployment rates varied by region. In the U.S., the unemployment rate decreased from 6.7% in January 2014 to 5.6% by December 2014, indicating an improving job market. However, some European countries, like Spain and Greece, continued to struggle with high unemployment rates.

4. **Debts**: Public and private debt levels were a concern in several economies. Many countries, especially in the Eurozone, were dealing with high levels of public debt, and there were ongoing discussions about debt sustainability.

Given this information, the claim that 2014 was a year of stagnation, inflation, unemployment, and climbing debts is not entirely accurate. While there were regions and countries that faced economic challenges, the global picture was more nuanced.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
The rate of debt to national income is below 30 percent.The ratio of the debt of European countries to national income is 3 times Turkey and the budget deficits are 3 times Turkey.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The rate of debt to national income in Turkey is below 30 percent.
2. The ratio of the debt of European countries to national income is 3 times that of Turkey.
3. The budget deficits of European countries are 3 times that of Turkey.

Let's break down each point:

1. **Debt to National Income in Turkey**: According to recent data, Turkey's debt-to-GDP ratio has been fluctuating, but it has generally been below 40 percent in recent years. However, it is important to check the most current statistics to confirm if it is indeed below 30 percent.

2. **Debt to National Income in European Countries**: The debt-to-GDP ratio for many European countries varies significantly. For example, countries like Greece and Italy have very high debt-to-GDP ratios (well over 100 percent), while others like Germany have lower ratios (around 60-70 percent). On average, the debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU is higher than Turkey's, but saying it is exactly 3 times Turkey's ratio would require specific calculations and comparisons.

3. **Budget Deficits of European Countries vs. Turkey**: Budget deficits also vary widely among European countries. Some countries have significant deficits, while others have managed to keep them relatively low. Comparing the average budget deficit of European countries to Turkey's and claiming it is exactly 3 times would again require specific data.

Given the variability and the need for precise and up-to-date data to confirm these claims, it is challenging to definitively state the accuracy without further detailed analysis.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
What was the price of oil before they arrived (Syrian refugees)?The barrel was over $ 100.How much now?Around $ 50.,true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the timeline and the context of oil prices and the arrival of Syrian refugees.

1. **Oil Prices**: 
   - Before the Syrian civil war began in 2011, oil prices were indeed over $100 per barrel. For example, in 2008, oil prices peaked at around $147 per barrel.
   - By mid-2014, oil prices were still over $100 per barrel.
   - However, by the end of 2014, oil prices had dropped significantly to around $50 per barrel due to various factors, including increased oil production in the United States and OPEC's decision not to cut production.

2. **Syrian Refugees**:
   - The Syrian civil war began in 2011, leading to a significant increase in the number of refugees fleeing the country.
   - The peak of the Syrian refugee crisis in terms of international attention and numbers was around 2015.

3. **Correlation vs. Causation**:
   - The claim seems to imply a causal relationship between the arrival of Syrian refugees and the drop in oil prices. However, the drop in oil prices was primarily due to market dynamics, including supply and demand factors, rather than the movement of refugees.

Given this context, the claim that oil prices were over $100 before the arrival of Syrian refugees and around $50 now is factually accurate in terms of the timeline. However, the implication that the arrival of Syrian refugees caused the drop in oil prices is misleading.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Since 2009, the highest trade with Israel has been experienced.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Since 2009, the highest trade with Israel has been experienced,"" we need to examine trade data between Israel and its trading partners over the years since 2009. This involves looking at trends in trade volume, including imports and exports, to see if there has been a significant increase or peak in trade activity.

Without specific data at hand, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we consider general trends, Israel has seen growth in its trade relationships, particularly in technology, pharmaceuticals, and defense sectors. If there have been notable peaks or record highs in trade volumes in recent years, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Turkey's share of education is more than 5.8 percent of national income.In this context, we are the country that allocates the most resources for education in Europe.There is no country that allocates resources for more education than Turkey.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare Turkey's education spending as a percentage of national income (GDP) with that of other European countries. According to the latest available data from sources such as the OECD and Eurostat, many European countries allocate a significant portion of their GDP to education. For instance, countries like Norway, Denmark, and Sweden often spend more than 6% of their GDP on education.

Given that Turkey's share of education spending is stated to be more than 5.8%, it is unlikely that Turkey allocates the most resources for education in Europe. Therefore, the claim that ""There is no country that allocates resources for more education than Turkey"" is not accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"Compared to 28 EU member states, we are the 4th country in the best state of the general state budget balance.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Compared to 28 EU member states, we are the 4th country in the best state of the general state budget balance,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The number of EU member states: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the European Union has 27 member states, not 28. The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020.

2. The ranking of the country in question: We need to check the most recent data on the general state budget balance of EU member states to see if the country in question is indeed ranked 4th.

Given that the claim references 28 EU member states, which is incorrect, and without specific data to verify the exact ranking, the claim cannot be fully accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
There are one million 350 thousand Syrians and no control and record,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""There are one million 350 thousand Syrians and no control and record,"" we need to break it down into two parts: the number of Syrians and the assertion about control and record.

1. **Number of Syrians**: The claim states that there are 1,350,000 Syrians. This number could be referring to Syrians in a specific country or region, such as Turkey, Lebanon, or another country hosting Syrian refugees. As of recent data, Turkey hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees, with figures around 3.6 million. Lebanon and Jordan also host significant numbers, but these figures are generally lower than 1.35 million. Therefore, the number 1,350,000 could be accurate in a specific context, but it is not universally applicable.

2. **Control and Record**: The claim also states that there is ""no control and record."" This is a broad and somewhat ambiguous statement. Most countries hosting large numbers of refugees have some form of registration and control mechanisms in place, although the efficiency and comprehensiveness of these systems can vary. For example, Turkey has a registration system for Syrian refugees, although there may be challenges in maintaining complete and up-to-date records.

Given the complexity and variability of the situation, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
We became a country that lends to IMF,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We became a country that lends to IMF,"" we need to understand the relationship between countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF is an international organization that provides financial assistance and advice to member countries. It is funded by its member countries, which contribute to a pool of resources that can be used to help countries in need.

Countries that are economically stable and have surplus funds can indeed lend to the IMF. These contributions are part of the IMF's financial resources and are used to support other member countries facing economic difficulties. Therefore, if a country has reached a level of economic stability and surplus that allows it to contribute to the IMF's resources, the claim can be considered accurate.

Given this context, if the country in question has indeed started contributing to the IMF's pool of resources, the claim would be 'True'.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
Real salary growth rate exceeds inflation two or three times,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Real salary growth rate exceeds inflation two or three times,"" we need to understand the definitions and recent data on real salary growth and inflation.

1. **Real Salary Growth Rate**: This is the rate at which salaries increase after adjusting for inflation. It reflects the actual increase in purchasing power of the salary.

2. **Inflation Rate**: This is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, eroding purchasing power.

For the claim to be true, the real salary growth rate must be at least two to three times higher than the inflation rate. For example, if the inflation rate is 2%, the real salary growth rate should be between 4% and 6%.

To evaluate this claim, we would need specific data on recent real salary growth rates and inflation rates. Without specific data, we can only make a general assessment based on typical economic conditions.

In many developed economies, real salary growth rates tend to be modest and often close to the inflation rate. It is relatively rare for real salary growth to significantly outpace inflation by a factor of two or three. However, there can be exceptions during periods of rapid economic growth or significant productivity improvements.

Given the general economic trends and without specific data to support the claim, it is unlikely that real salary growth consistently exceeds inflation by such a large margin.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Türkiye, the last Europe in the internet speed",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Türkiye, the last Europe in the internet speed,"" we need to look at recent and reliable data on internet speeds across European countries, including Türkiye.

According to the Speedtest Global Index by Ookla, which provides monthly updates on internet speeds worldwide, Türkiye's internet speed rankings can be compared to other European countries. As of the latest available data, Türkiye is not the last in Europe in terms of internet speed. While it may not be among the top performers, there are other countries in Europe with slower internet speeds.

Therefore, the claim that Türkiye is the last in Europe in internet speed is not accurate.

"The highest single month of the last 20 years has arrived in food inflation, close to 6.5 %.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The highest single month of the last 20 years has arrived in food inflation, close to 6.5%,"" we need to verify historical data on food inflation rates over the past 20 years.

1. **Historical Data Check**: We need to look at the monthly food inflation rates for the past 20 years to see if any month had a food inflation rate close to or higher than 6.5%.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: Food inflation can be volatile and influenced by various factors such as supply chain disruptions, weather conditions, and economic policies. It's important to compare the claimed rate with historical peaks.

3. **Verification Sources**: Reliable sources for this data include government reports, central bank publications, and reputable financial news outlets.

Without access to the specific historical data at this moment, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on recent data and historical trends, we can make an educated guess.

Given the context and the need for precise verification, the claim seems plausible but requires confirmation.

"According to the Court of Accounts report, the daily expenditure of the palace in 2019 was 10 million and the annual expenditure was 3.6 billion pounds.Daily expenditure, which was 2.5 million pounds in 2018, increased 4 times in 2019",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Daily Expenditure in 2019**: The claim states that the daily expenditure of the palace in 2019 was 10 million pounds.
2. **Annual Expenditure in 2019**: The claim states that the annual expenditure in 2019 was 3.6 billion pounds.
3. **Daily Expenditure in 2018**: The claim states that the daily expenditure in 2018 was 2.5 million pounds.
4. **Increase in Daily Expenditure**: The claim states that the daily expenditure increased 4 times from 2018 to 2019.

Let's verify these points:

- **Daily Expenditure in 2019**: If the daily expenditure was 10 million pounds, the annual expenditure would be \( 10 \text{ million pounds/day} \times 365 \text{ days/year} = 3.65 \text{ billion pounds/year} \). This is very close to the stated annual expenditure of 3.6 billion pounds, so this part seems accurate.
  
- **Daily Expenditure in 2018**: The claim states it was 2.5 million pounds.

- **Increase in Daily Expenditure**: If the daily expenditure increased from 2.5 million pounds in 2018 to 10 million pounds in 2019, the increase factor would be \( \frac{10 \text{ million}}{2.5 \text{ million}} = 4 \). This matches the claim of a 4 times increase.

Given that all the provided figures and calculations align correctly with the claim, the claim appears to be accurate.

"... (Turkey) We were one of the most important cotton manufacturers in the world for a period, we are currently one of the most important cotton importers in the world.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. Whether Turkey was once one of the most important cotton manufacturers in the world.
2. Whether Turkey is currently one of the most important cotton importers in the world.

1. Historical Context:
Turkey has a long history of cotton production and was indeed a significant player in the global cotton industry. The country has favorable climatic conditions for cotton cultivation, and regions like the Aegean and Southeastern Anatolia have been prominent cotton-growing areas. During certain periods, especially in the 20th century, Turkey was recognized as a major cotton producer and manufacturer.

2. Current Context:
In recent years, Turkey has become one of the largest importers of cotton. The country's textile and apparel industry is highly developed, and to meet the demands of this industry, Turkey imports a substantial amount of cotton. According to data from various trade and industry reports, Turkey ranks among the top cotton-importing countries globally.

Given this information, the claim appears to be accurate in both historical and current contexts.

1. The claim states that an average of 75 million saplings were produced annually between 1992 and 2002.
2. The claim also states that the amount of saplings produced in 2017 increased to 322 million.

If both of these statements are accurate based on reliable data sources, then the claim would be 'True'. If there are discrepancies or if the data is not entirely accurate, the claim could fall into one of the other categories.

Without access to the specific data sources to verify these numbers, I cannot definitively confirm the accuracy of the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate, the claim would be 'True'.

"For private yachts, the liter of the fuel is taken from 1.25 pounds, the farmers pay 3.45 pounds for the diesel they receive to use tractor and combine harvester.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific prices of fuel for private yachts and for farmers using diesel for tractors and combine harvesters. Fuel prices can vary significantly based on location, taxes, subsidies, and market conditions. 

1. **Private Yachts Fuel Price**: The claim states that the price is 1.25 pounds per liter. This price can vary depending on the country, the type of fuel (marine diesel, gasoline, etc.), and other factors. 

2. **Farmers' Diesel Price**: The claim states that farmers pay 3.45 pounds per liter for diesel. Similar to the yacht fuel price, this can vary based on location, subsidies, and market conditions.

Without specific, up-to-date information on fuel prices in the relevant region, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge, the price of diesel for agricultural use is often subsidized and typically lower than the price for recreational use like private yachts. 

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact prices mentioned in the claim, the most accurate assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
Children's brides are the third in the world.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Children's brides are the third in the world,"" we need to consider the context and available data on child marriage globally.

Child marriage is a significant issue in many parts of the world, with varying prevalence rates. According to data from organizations like UNICEF and the World Bank, countries with the highest rates of child marriage include Niger, Central African Republic, Chad, Bangladesh, and others. These countries often have child marriage rates that are among the highest in the world.

The claim ""Children's brides are the third in the world"" is ambiguous and lacks specific context. It could be interpreted in several ways:
1. The country with the third-highest rate of child brides.
2. The third most common issue affecting children globally.
3. The third largest number of child brides in the world.

Given the ambiguity and the lack of specific context, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, based on the available data, it is unlikely that ""Children's brides"" as a general category would be ranked third in any specific global context without more precise information.

There are 17 million poor today at the point where the 12 -year AKP government came.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""There are 17 million poor today at the point where the 12-year AKP government came,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: The AKP (Justice and Development Party) came to power in Turkey in 2002. Therefore, the 12-year mark would be around 2014.

2. **Poverty Statistics**: We need to look at reliable sources of poverty statistics in Turkey around 2014. This includes data from Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), World Bank, and other reputable organizations.

3. **Definitions and Measurements**: Poverty can be measured in different ways, such as absolute poverty, relative poverty, or using different poverty lines (e.g., national poverty line, international poverty line).

4. **Comparative Analysis**: We should compare the number of people living in poverty in 2002 (when AKP came to power) and in 2014 to see if the claim holds.

Without access to specific data points from these sources, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge and trends, we can make an educated assessment.

**General Trends**:
- The AKP government has been credited with significant economic growth and poverty reduction in its early years.
- However, economic challenges and fluctuations have also been noted, which could affect poverty levels.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, the claim seems to be an oversimplification and may not fully capture the nuances of poverty trends over the 12-year period.

"He is the authority of the prime minister who should represent administratively in the G-20 meetings.In previous meetings, as in the last meeting of Australia, Davutoğlu should have continued this task.",half true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break down the key points:

1. ""He is the authority of the prime minister who should represent administratively in the G-20 meetings.""
2. ""In previous meetings, as in the last meeting of Australia, Davutoğlu should have continued this task.""

First, the representation at G-20 meetings typically involves heads of state or government, which often includes prime ministers or presidents. The specific individual representing a country can vary based on the country's internal decisions and circumstances.

Second, Ahmet Davutoğlu was the Prime Minister of Turkey from 2014 to 2016. The G-20 summit in Australia took place in November 2014, during Davutoğlu's tenure as Prime Minister.

Given these points:
- It is accurate that the Prime Minister of Turkey would be a key representative at G-20 meetings.
- Davutoğlu, being the Prime Minister at the time of the 2014 G-20 summit in Australia, would have been expected to represent Turkey.

Therefore, the claim aligns with the facts regarding Davutoğlu's role and the general practice of prime ministers representing their countries at G-20 meetings.

Ilham Aliyev's claim of money on foreign tourists,mostly true,az,"To determine the accuracy of Ilham Aliyev's claim about money on foreign tourists, we need to examine the specific details of the claim, such as the context in which it was made, the data or evidence supporting it, and any relevant statistics or reports on tourism and foreign spending in Azerbaijan.

Without the specific details of the claim, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that the claim pertains to the economic impact of foreign tourists in Azerbaijan, we can look at general trends and data.

Azerbaijan has been actively promoting tourism as part of its economic diversification strategy. The country has seen an increase in the number of foreign tourists in recent years, and tourism has contributed to the national economy. According to the State Tourism Agency of Azerbaijan, the country has experienced growth in tourism revenue, which suggests that foreign tourists do spend money in Azerbaijan.

Given this context, if Ilham Aliyev's claim is that foreign tourists contribute significantly to the economy by spending money, it is likely to be supported by available data.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
Azerbaijan has no special obligation in front of the European Parliament,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Azerbaijan has no special obligation in front of the European Parliament,"" we need to consider the nature of Azerbaijan's relationship with the European Parliament and the European Union (EU).

1. **European Parliament and EU Membership**: The European Parliament is one of the legislative bodies of the European Union. Countries that are members of the EU have specific obligations to the European Parliament, including adherence to EU laws and regulations.

2. **Azerbaijan's Status**: Azerbaijan is not a member of the European Union. Therefore, it does not have the same obligations to the European Parliament as EU member states do.

3. **Partnership and Cooperation**: While Azerbaijan is not an EU member, it is part of the EU's Eastern Partnership, which aims to build a common area of shared values of democracy, prosperity, stability, and increased cooperation. This partnership does involve certain commitments and cooperation agreements, but these do not equate to the obligations of an EU member state.

4. **Special Obligations**: The term ""special obligation"" implies a unique or specific set of duties that go beyond general cooperation or partnership agreements. Since Azerbaijan is not an EU member and its commitments under the Eastern Partnership are not equivalent to those of EU members, it does not have ""special obligations"" in front of the European Parliament.

Based on this analysis, the claim that ""Azerbaijan has no special obligation in front of the European Parliament"" is accurate.

The contraction in the automotive sector was based on 30 percent.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The contraction in the automotive sector was based on 30 percent,"" we need to verify the specific data regarding the contraction in the automotive sector. This involves checking reliable sources such as industry reports, economic analyses, or official statistics.

Without specific data to confirm or refute the exact percentage, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is referring to a specific period or context, and if there is no evidence to support a 30 percent contraction, we would lean towards it being inaccurate.

Given the lack of specific data provided in the question, the most cautious approach would be to consider the claim as not fully substantiated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Our country ranks second in the world as a figure in this field with its 6 billion dollars of human development aids in 2016 and the first in compared to its national income.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the country in question ranked second in the world in terms of human development aid in 2016 with 6 billion dollars.
2. Whether the country ranked first in terms of human development aid compared to its national income in 2016.

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other international aid tracking organizations, Turkey was reported to have provided significant amounts of humanitarian aid in 2016. Turkey's contributions were indeed substantial, and it was recognized for its generosity relative to its national income.

1. **Ranking Second in the World**: Turkey was reported to be one of the top donors in terms of humanitarian aid in 2016. However, the exact ranking can vary depending on the source and the specific metrics used (e.g., total amount vs. per capita). Some sources might place Turkey second, while others might have different rankings.

2. **First Compared to National Income**: Turkey was often highlighted for its high level of aid relative to its national income, frequently being cited as the most generous in this regard.

Given these points, the claim appears to be largely accurate but may depend on specific sources and metrics. Therefore, the claim is not entirely without basis but might be slightly overstated or simplified.

"(In terms of economic size) ... We have already been in the top 20, but we were in the 13th, 14th place of the top 20 in 84, and now we are in 17th.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the historical and current economic rankings of the country in question. The claim states that the country was in the 13th or 14th place in 1984 and is now in the 17th place.

1. **Historical Ranking (1984):**
   - We need to check the global economic rankings for the year 1984 to see if the country was indeed in the 13th or 14th position.

2. **Current Ranking:**
   - We need to check the most recent global economic rankings to see if the country is currently in the 17th position.

Assuming we have access to reliable data sources such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), or other reputable economic databases, we can verify these rankings.

**Verification:**

- **1984 Ranking:** If historical data shows that the country was ranked 13th or 14th in terms of GDP in 1984, this part of the claim is accurate.
- **Current Ranking:** If the latest data shows that the country is currently ranked 17th, this part of the claim is accurate.

If both parts of the claim are verified to be accurate, the claim is 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies, it might be 'Mostly True'. Significant discrepancies would lead to 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on the extent of the inaccuracies.

**Example Verification:**
- If historical data shows the country was 15th in 1984 and is now 17th, the claim would be 'Mostly True' because it is close but not exact.
- If the country was 20th in 1984 and is now 17th, the claim would be 'False'.

**Conclusion:**
Without the specific data at hand, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and assuming the data is accurate:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"Istanbul, the 15th most population in the world, would be one of the world's 25-30 economies in the world if it was a country alone, producing one-quarter of GDP, which produces 40 %of the taxes.",mostly true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. **Istanbul being the 15th most populous city in the world**:
   - As of recent data, Istanbul is indeed one of the most populous cities globally, but its exact rank can vary depending on the source. It is often listed within the top 20, but not consistently at the 15th position.

2. **Istanbul would be one of the world's 25-30 largest economies if it were a country**:
   - Istanbul has a significant economy, but specific rankings can be challenging to verify. However, it is plausible that Istanbul's economy could rank within the top 25-30 if it were considered a separate country, given its substantial contribution to Turkey's GDP.

3. **Istanbul produces one-quarter of Turkey's GDP**:
   - This is generally accurate. Istanbul is a major economic hub in Turkey and contributes a significant portion of the national GDP, often cited around 30%.

4. **Istanbul produces 40% of Turkey's taxes**:
   - This is also a reasonable claim. Istanbul is a major financial center and generates a large portion of the country's tax revenue, often cited around 40%.

Given the information, the claim is mostly accurate but may have slight variations in specific figures or rankings.

We built 205 thousand classrooms in 12 years.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We built 205 thousand classrooms in 12 years,"" we would need to verify the following:

1. The source of the claim: Who is making this statement? Is it a government official, an educational authority, or another credible source?
2. The data: Are there official records, reports, or statistics that confirm the construction of 205,000 classrooms over the specified period?
3. Context: Does the claim consider all types of classrooms (e.g., public, private, temporary, permanent)?

Without access to specific data or verification sources, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made by a credible source and there is no immediate contradictory evidence, we might lean towards a cautious assessment.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most balanced approach would be to consider it as ""Half True,"" acknowledging that it could be partially accurate but requires further verification.

The claim that a foreign country can only act within the boundaries of its consulate or embassy and that actions outside these boundaries are subject to permission is true. Diplomatic missions such as embassies and consulates are considered the territory of the sending state, but any activities outside these premises require the host country's permission. This is in line with international diplomatic protocols and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.",,False,True
The presidential budget increases by 97 %and breaks an unprecedented increase in history.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The presidential budget increases by 97% and breaks an unprecedented increase in history,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: We need to compare the claimed 97% increase to historical increases in the presidential budget. If there have been other instances where the budget increased by a similar or greater percentage, the claim would not be unprecedented.

2. **Verification of the 97% Increase**: We need to verify if the presidential budget indeed increased by 97% in the specified period. This would involve looking at official budget documents and comparing the figures from one fiscal year to the next.

3. **Definition of 'Unprecedented'**: The term 'unprecedented' means that it has never happened before. Therefore, if there has been any other instance in history where the budget increased by a similar or greater percentage, the claim would be false.

Without specific data and historical records to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on general knowledge, a 97% increase in the presidential budget would be extraordinarily high and likely to be unprecedented in modern history.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact percentage and historical context, the most cautious and reasonable assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
Coronavirus: Mikayil Jabbarov's statement on employees to receive assistance,mostly true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Coronavirus: Mikayil Jabbarov's statement on employees to receive assistance,"" I would need to verify the specific details of Mikayil Jabbarov's statement and any official actions or policies he announced regarding assistance to employees during the coronavirus pandemic.

Mikayil Jabbarov is the Minister of Economy of Azerbaijan, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments, including Azerbaijan's, announced various forms of assistance to employees and businesses affected by the crisis. If Jabbarov made a public statement confirming that employees would receive assistance, and if there is evidence to support that such assistance was indeed provided or planned, the claim could be considered accurate.

Without specific details or verification of the statement and the actions taken, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the statement was made and there is some level of support or evidence for it, the claim could be considered 'Mostly True.'

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
I won Ahmet Davutoğlu to politics,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""I won Ahmet Davutoğlu to politics,"" we need to consider the context and the role of the person making the claim in Ahmet Davutoğlu's political career.

Ahmet Davutoğlu is a prominent Turkish politician who served as the Prime Minister of Turkey from 2014 to 2016. Before entering politics, he was an academic and a foreign policy advisor. His entry into politics was significantly influenced by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the then Prime Minister and later President of Turkey. Erdoğan appointed Davutoğlu as his chief advisor in 2003 and later as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2009, which marked Davutoğlu's formal entry into politics.

Given this context, if the claim is made by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, it would be considered accurate because Erdoğan played a crucial role in bringing Davutoğlu into the political arena.

We have 6 million 200 thousand unemployed.The number of people who are unemployed in the last two months is 1 million 300 thousand.400 thousand people have been looking for a job for a year.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break down the numbers provided:

1. **Total Unemployed**: 6,200,000
2. **Unemployed in the Last Two Months**: 1,300,000
3. **People Looking for a Job for a Year**: 400,000

The claim states:
- ""We have 6 million 200 thousand unemployed.""
- ""The number of people who are unemployed in the last two months is 1 million 300 thousand.""
- ""400 thousand people have been looking for a job for a year.""

Each of these statements is consistent with the numbers provided. Therefore, the claim accurately reflects the data given.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
There are currently 18 private pension companies in Turkey.14 of them are foreigners…,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""There are currently 18 private pension companies in Turkey, 14 of them are foreigners,"" we need to verify the number of private pension companies operating in Turkey and the proportion that are foreign-owned.

As of the latest available data, Turkey's private pension system includes several companies, but the exact number and the ownership details can change over time. The most reliable sources for this information would be the Turkish Pension Monitoring Center (EGM) or the Turkish Insurance Association (TSB).

Given the dynamic nature of the financial sector and the potential for mergers, acquisitions, and new entries or exits, the specific numbers might vary. However, without access to the most current and specific data, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim.

Based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the claim seems to be an overestimation of the number of foreign-owned private pension companies in Turkey. The actual number of foreign-owned companies is likely lower than 14.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
We started to work 'e-Vize' with the idea that they can get more comfortable visas and give the tourists to Turkey.There is no example of this in the world.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the specific points made:

1. ""We started to work 'e-Vize' with the idea that they can get more comfortable visas and give the tourists to Turkey.""
2. ""There is no example of this in the world.""

The first part of the claim suggests that the e-Vize system was developed to make obtaining visas more comfortable for tourists visiting Turkey. This is a reasonable and likely true statement, as many countries develop electronic visa systems to streamline the visa application process.

The second part of the claim states that there is no example of this in the world. This is not accurate, as many countries have implemented electronic visa systems before Turkey. For example, Australia has had an electronic visa system (eVisitor) since 2008, and the United States has the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) for visa waiver program countries.

Given that the first part of the claim is likely true but the second part is demonstrably false, the overall claim is a mix of accurate and inaccurate information.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The law on the law of lawyers creates difficulties for low-income families,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The law on the law of lawyers creates difficulties for low-income families,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Regulation and Costs**: Laws governing lawyers often include regulations that can increase the cost of legal services. These costs can be prohibitive for low-income families, making it difficult for them to access legal representation.

2. **Access to Justice**: Many low-income families struggle to afford legal services due to high fees and complex legal processes. If the laws governing lawyers do not provide sufficient support for pro bono work or legal aid, this can exacerbate the difficulties faced by low-income families.

3. **Legal Aid and Pro Bono Work**: Some jurisdictions have laws that encourage or mandate pro bono work and provide funding for legal aid services. However, if these provisions are insufficient or poorly implemented, low-income families may still face significant barriers.

Given these points, the claim has a basis in reality, but the extent of the difficulties can vary depending on the specific legal framework and support systems in place in different regions.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
We do not hold any opposition with drugs after the campaign,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We do not hold any opposition with drugs after the campaign,"" we need to consider the context and any available evidence regarding the stance of the entity making the claim both before and after the campaign.

1. **True**: This would mean that the entity had no opposition to drugs both before and after the campaign.
2. **Mostly True**: This would mean that the entity had little to no opposition to drugs after the campaign, with perhaps minor exceptions.
3. **Half True**: This would mean that the entity's opposition to drugs changed somewhat after the campaign, but not completely.
4. **Mostly False**: This would mean that the entity still holds significant opposition to drugs after the campaign, with perhaps minor changes.
5. **False**: This would mean that the entity continues to hold strong opposition to drugs after the campaign, with no significant change.

Without specific evidence or context about the entity's stance before and after the campaign, it is challenging to accurately categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the entity had a strong opposition to drugs before the campaign and the claim is that this opposition has completely disappeared after the campaign, we would need evidence to support this complete shift.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, the safest assumption is that the claim is likely overstated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Industrial production of October increased by 4.6 percent compared to the same month of the previous year.We have reached the highest level since 2005.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two key points:

1. **Industrial Production Increase**: The claim states that industrial production in October increased by 4.6 percent compared to the same month of the previous year. This can be verified by checking official industrial production statistics from a reliable source such as a government agency or a reputable economic research organization.

2. **Highest Level Since 2005**: The claim also states that this increase has brought industrial production to its highest level since 2005. This requires historical data on industrial production levels to confirm whether the current level surpasses all previous levels since 2005.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot definitively verify these points. However, if we assume the data provided in the claim is accurate and comes from a reliable source, the claim would be considered 'True'. If there are any discrepancies or if the data is not from a reliable source, the accuracy could vary.

Given the information provided and assuming the data is accurate:

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
The PACE rapporteur was threatening Azerbaijan,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The PACE rapporteur was threatening Azerbaijan,"" we need to examine the context and evidence surrounding the statement. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) appoints rapporteurs to investigate and report on various issues, and their role is typically to provide objective analysis and recommendations rather than to issue threats.

If there is no credible evidence or direct statements from the PACE rapporteur that can be interpreted as threats towards Azerbaijan, then the claim would be considered false. However, if there are statements or actions that could be reasonably interpreted as threatening, the claim might hold some truth.

Without specific evidence or context indicating that the PACE rapporteur made threatening statements or actions towards Azerbaijan, the claim appears to be unsubstantiated.

1. **Population Increase**: The claim states that Turkey's population increased from 59 million to 80 million.
   - According to historical data, Turkey's population was around 59 million in the early 1990s. As of recent estimates, Turkey's population is approximately 84 million. So, the population increase is roughly accurate.

2. **Number of Voters**: The claim states that the number of voters increased from 29 million to 59 million.
   - Historical data shows that the number of registered voters in Turkey was around 29 million in the early 1990s. As of recent elections, the number of registered voters is indeed around 59 million. This part of the claim is accurate.

3. **Increase in Deputies**: The claim mentions an increase of 100 deputies and then states an increase of 50.
   - The number of seats in the Turkish Grand National Assembly was increased from 450 to 550 in 1995, and then to 600 in 2018. This means there was an increase of 100 deputies in 1995 and another 50 deputies in 2018. This part of the claim is also accurate.

Given that the key points in the claim are supported by historical and current data, the claim is accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"While trusting the judiciary in Turkey was in 60-70 percent, it has now fallen below 20 percent.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that trust in the judiciary in Turkey has fallen from 60-70 percent to below 20 percent, we need to look at reliable sources such as surveys, studies, or reports from credible organizations that track public opinion in Turkey.

1. **Historical Trust Levels**: According to various surveys conducted in the past, trust in the judiciary in Turkey was indeed relatively high, often reported in the range of 60-70 percent. For example, surveys by organizations like the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) and international bodies have shown high levels of trust in the judiciary in the early 2000s.

2. **Current Trust Levels**: More recent surveys and reports indicate a significant decline in trust in the judiciary. For instance, a 2021 survey by the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation (TESEV) found that trust in the judiciary had fallen to around 20 percent or even lower. Other reports and studies by international organizations such as Freedom House and Transparency International also reflect a similar trend of declining trust in the judiciary in Turkey.

Given this information, the claim that trust in the judiciary in Turkey has fallen from 60-70 percent to below 20 percent is supported by multiple sources and appears to be accurate.

Population increase is directly Linked with Socio-Economic Development,mostly false,az,"Final Answer: Half True

Explanation: The relationship between population increase and socio-economic development is complex and multifaceted. In some contexts, population growth can drive economic development by providing a larger labor force and creating greater demand for goods and services. However, in other contexts, rapid population growth can strain resources, infrastructure, and social services, potentially hindering socio-economic development. Therefore, the claim is not universally true or false but depends on various factors such as the stage of development, government policies, and resource availability.",,False,True

This involves checking historical stock market data for the given period.

1. **Indian Stock Exchange**: Claimed depreciation is 18%.
2. **Japan**: Claimed depreciation is 20%.
3. **United States**: Claimed depreciation is 21%.
4. **United Kingdom**: Claimed depreciation is 22%.

6. **Italy**: Claimed depreciation is 32%.
7. **Overall loss**: Claimed to be 17%.

Without access to the exact historical data for each of these stock exchanges for the specified period, it is challenging to verify the precise accuracy of each percentage. However, given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic during early 2020, significant stock market declines were observed globally around this time.

Based on general knowledge of the market trends during that period, the claim appears to be in line with the significant market downturns experienced worldwide. However, without precise data, we cannot confirm the exact percentages.

Restrictions On Travel Of Russian Citizens of Armenian Origin to Azerbaijan is a Violation of Conditions of Agreement,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Restrictions On Travel Of Russian Citizens of Armenian Origin to Azerbaijan is a Violation of Conditions of Agreement,"" we need to consider the relevant agreements and international laws that might apply.

1. **Bilateral Agreements**: Russia and Azerbaijan have bilateral agreements that typically include provisions on the movement of citizens. If there are specific clauses that guarantee the free movement of citizens without discrimination based on ethnic origin, then restrictions could be seen as a violation.

2. **International Law**: International human rights laws, such as those under the United Nations, generally prohibit discrimination based on ethnicity. If Azerbaijan is a signatory to such treaties, then restricting travel based on Armenian origin could be a violation.

3. **Context of Conflict**: The historical and ongoing conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh might influence Azerbaijan's policies. However, this does not necessarily justify the violation of international agreements or human rights laws.

Given these points, if there are specific agreements between Russia and Azerbaijan that prohibit such discrimination, and considering international human rights laws, the claim could be seen as valid.

The ombudsman's work is based upon the paris principles and it independent operation is fully ensured both in the Legislation and Practice,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main components: the adherence to the Paris Principles and the independence of the ombudsman's operation in both legislation and practice.

1. **Paris Principles**: The Paris Principles relate to the status and functioning of national institutions for the protection and promotion of human rights. They emphasize independence, a broad mandate, adequate resources, and a pluralistic representation.

2. **Independence in Legislation and Practice**: This means that the ombudsman should be free from external influence, both legally and in actual practice, ensuring they can operate without interference.

Given that the claim states the ombudsman's work is based on the Paris Principles and that its independent operation is ensured in both legislation and practice, we need to verify if these conditions are met universally. 

While many countries strive to meet these standards, the actual implementation can vary significantly. Some countries may have strong legislative frameworks but face challenges in practice, while others might struggle with both aspects.

Without specific information about the country or context in question, it is difficult to assert that this claim is universally true. However, assuming the claim is made in a context where these standards are generally upheld, it could be considered mostly true.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
The World Health Organization has called Azerbaijan in the fight against Coronavirus,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The World Health Organization has called Azerbaijan in the fight against Coronavirus,"" we need to verify if there is any official statement or communication from the World Health Organization (WHO) that specifically mentions Azerbaijan in the context of the fight against Coronavirus (COVID-19).

1. **Check WHO Statements and Reports**: Review official WHO statements, press releases, and reports to see if Azerbaijan is mentioned in the context of COVID-19 efforts.
2. **Media Coverage**: Look for credible news sources that might have reported on any communication between WHO and Azerbaijan regarding COVID-19.
3. **Azerbaijan's COVID-19 Response**: Investigate if there have been notable actions or collaborations between WHO and Azerbaijan in combating the pandemic.

Based on the information available up to my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there is no widely known or specific instance where the WHO has publicly singled out Azerbaijan in a unique or notable way in the fight against COVID-19. The WHO has been working with many countries globally, including Azerbaijan, but without specific evidence of a unique call-out, the claim cannot be fully substantiated.

Is June 15 Are the starting date of our independence?,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Is June 15 the starting date of our independence?"", we need to know which country's independence is being referred to, as different countries have different dates for their independence.

For example:
- The United States celebrates its Independence Day on July 4.
- India celebrates its Independence Day on August 15.
- Mexico celebrates its Independence Day on September 16.

Without specifying the country, it is impossible to accurately assess the claim. However, based on the general knowledge of widely recognized independence dates, June 15 is not a common date for the independence of major countries.

The presumption of innocence was provided during the rule of Heydar Aliyev,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The presumption of innocence was provided during the rule of Heydar Aliyev,"" we need to consider the historical and legal context of Azerbaijan.

Heydar Aliyev was the President of Azerbaijan from 1993 to 2003. The presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle of criminal law, meaning that a person is considered innocent until proven guilty. This principle is enshrined in various international human rights documents, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 11) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 14).

Azerbaijan declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The presumption of innocence is a principle that was already recognized in Soviet law and continued to be recognized in the legal systems of post-Soviet states, including Azerbaijan. The Constitution of Azerbaijan, adopted in 1995 during Heydar Aliyev's presidency, explicitly includes the presumption of innocence in Article 63.

"The terror, which was reset in 2002, revived with the AKP.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The terror, which was reset in 2002, revived with the AKP,"" we need to consider historical and political context.

1. **Historical Context**: In 2002, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in Turkey. The period before 2002 saw significant political instability and conflict, including issues related to terrorism, particularly from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

2. **AKP's Early Years**: Initially, the AKP government pursued policies aimed at reducing conflict and promoting economic growth. There were efforts to engage in peace talks with the PKK, and for a time, there was a reduction in violence.

3. **Revival of Conflict**: However, in the subsequent years, particularly after the breakdown of peace talks around 2015, there was a resurgence of violence and terrorist activities. The conflict with the PKK intensified, and there were also attacks attributed to other groups, including ISIS.

Given this context, the claim that terror was ""reset"" in 2002 and then ""revived"" with the AKP is somewhat oversimplified but has elements of truth. The AKP's initial period did see a reduction in violence, but later years saw a resurgence.

"Due to psychological disorders in the last 4 years, the number of applicants have increased by 4 times.The number increased from 3 million to 9 million.",mostly true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break down the information provided:

1. The claim states that the number of applicants has increased by 4 times.
2. The claim also states that the number increased from 3 million to 9 million.

First, let's verify the mathematical accuracy of the increase:

- If the number of applicants increased by 4 times, starting from 3 million, the new number should be:
  \( 3 \text{ million} \times 4 = 12 \text{ million} \)

However, the claim states that the number increased to 9 million, not 12 million. 

Therefore, the increase from 3 million to 9 million is actually a 3-fold increase, not a 4-fold increase.

Given this discrepancy, the claim is not accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"In the last 8 years in Ankara, one out of all three people who used the rail system gave up on boarding the subway.The population is increasing in Ankara, but the number of passengers decreases in public transport.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the two main points:

1. ""In the last 8 years in Ankara, one out of all three people who used the rail system gave up on boarding the subway.""
2. ""The population is increasing in Ankara, but the number of passengers decreases in public transport.""

Without specific data or sources to verify these statements, we can only assess the plausibility based on general trends and known information.

1. The first part of the claim suggests a significant drop in subway usage. If one out of three people who used the rail system gave up on boarding the subway, this would indicate a 33% decrease in subway ridership. This is a substantial decline and would likely be documented in transportation reports or studies.

2. The second part of the claim states that the population in Ankara is increasing while public transport usage is decreasing. This is plausible if there are factors such as increased car ownership, dissatisfaction with public transport services, or improvements in alternative transportation methods.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute these points, the claim seems to be based on observable trends but may not be entirely accurate in its specifics.

"During his fourteen -year AKP government, he closed 2 million tradesmen and craftsmen shops.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""During his fourteen-year AKP government, he closed 2 million tradesmen and craftsmen shops,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Context**: The AKP (Justice and Development Party) in Turkey, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has been in power since 2002. The claim refers to a 14-year period, which would roughly cover 2002 to 2016.

2. **Economic Data**: We need to look at the economic data and reports from credible sources such as Turkish government statistics, independent economic research, and reports from international organizations.

3. **Economic Trends**: The period in question saw significant economic changes in Turkey, including periods of growth and recession. The closure of shops could be influenced by various factors such as economic policies, market conditions, and global economic trends.

4. **Verification**: To verify the claim, we would need specific data on the number of tradesmen and craftsmen shops that closed during this period. This data should ideally come from official records or credible research studies.

Without access to specific and verifiable data, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, based on general knowledge and the need for precise data to support such a specific number, the claim appears to be exaggerated or lacking context.

Azerbaijan is The Country With The Highest Per Capita Population of Idps and Refugees in The World,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan is the country with the highest per capita population of IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) and refugees in the world,"" we need to examine the available data on IDPs and refugees globally.

Azerbaijan has a significant number of IDPs due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which has displaced many people within the country. However, other countries also have large populations of IDPs and refugees, such as Syria, Colombia, and South Sudan, which have experienced prolonged conflicts and crises.

According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), countries like Syria and Colombia have some of the highest numbers of IDPs. When considering refugees, countries like Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan host large numbers of refugees relative to their populations due to the Syrian conflict.

While Azerbaijan has a high per capita population of IDPs, it is not definitively the highest in the world when considering both IDPs and refugees. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

"Looking at the merger and purchasing transactions last year, the number of foreigners was at the lowest level of the last 8 years.Domestic and foreign investor transaction volume has also decreased to Türkiye's potential.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the following points:

1. The number of foreign investors in merger and purchasing transactions last year was at the lowest level in the last 8 years.
2. The transaction volume of both domestic and foreign investors has decreased to Türkiye's potential.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and verified data, we can make an educated guess.

Given the context of global economic fluctuations, geopolitical issues, and potential local economic challenges, it is plausible that foreign investment could have decreased. Similarly, if the overall economic environment in Türkiye has been challenging, it could lead to a decrease in transaction volumes.

Therefore, based on the assumption that the claim is grounded in accurate data, the statement seems plausible but not definitively verifiable without specific data.

"'' (Savings rates) 52 percent in China, 35 percent in India, 22 percent, 23, 24 percent in the EU savings rates in Turkey is still 13.4 percent ''",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim regarding savings rates in various countries, we need to compare the provided figures with the most recent and reliable data available from credible sources such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), or national statistics agencies.

1. **China**: The claim states a savings rate of 52 percent. According to the World Bank, China's gross savings rate has been around 45-50% in recent years, but it can fluctuate.
2. **India**: The claim states a savings rate of 35 percent. The World Bank data shows India's gross savings rate has been around 30% in recent years.
3. **EU**: The claim states savings rates of 22, 23, 24 percent. The EU's gross savings rate has been around 25% on average, but it varies by country.
4. **Turkey**: The claim states a savings rate of 13.4 percent. According to the World Bank, Turkey's gross savings rate has been around 25% in recent years, but it has seen fluctuations.

Given these comparisons, the claim contains some inaccuracies and overgeneralizations. The figures for China and India are somewhat close but not exact, the EU's rate is within a reasonable range, and Turkey's rate is significantly understated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
We have reduced oil production for the obligations we have under the Opec +,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have reduced oil production for the obligations we have under the Opec +,"" we need to consider the context and the facts surrounding OPEC+ agreements and actions.

OPEC+ is a coalition of oil-producing countries that includes the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major oil producers like Russia. This group often agrees on production targets to manage oil prices and supply in the global market.

1. **OPEC+ Agreements**: OPEC+ has indeed made several agreements to reduce oil production, especially in response to market conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically reduced demand for oil. These agreements are aimed at stabilizing the oil market by controlling supply.

2. **Compliance with Obligations**: Member countries, including those in OPEC+, are expected to comply with these production cuts. While compliance can vary, many countries do reduce their oil production as part of their obligations under these agreements.

3. **Recent Actions**: As of the latest information available up to 2023, OPEC+ has continued to adjust its production targets in response to market conditions. This includes both increasing and decreasing production as needed.

Given this context, the claim that ""We have reduced oil production for the obligations we have under the Opec +"" aligns with the general actions and agreements made by OPEC+ members to manage oil production.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
All of the developing countries with depreciation are oil producers.,half true,tr,"To evaluate the claim ""All of the developing countries with depreciation are oil producers,"" we need to consider the following points:

1. **Definition of Developing Countries**: Developing countries are nations with a lower living standard, underdeveloped industrial base, and low Human Development Index relative to other countries.

2. **Currency Depreciation**: Currency depreciation refers to a decrease in the value of a country's currency relative to other currencies.

3. **Oil Producers**: Oil-producing countries are those that extract and export significant quantities of oil.

4. **Economic Factors**: Currency depreciation in developing countries can be influenced by various factors, including but not limited to oil production. Other factors include political instability, economic policies, trade deficits, inflation, and external debt.

Given these points, it is clear that while some developing countries with currency depreciation are oil producers, not all of them are. Many developing countries experience currency depreciation due to reasons unrelated to oil production. For example, countries like Venezuela and Nigeria are oil producers with currency depreciation, but there are also non-oil-producing developing countries like Argentina and Turkey that have experienced significant currency depreciation.

Therefore, the claim that ""All of the developing countries with depreciation are oil producers"" is not accurate.

Only 45 %of 8 million women employed in Turkey are registered.90 %of women working in the agricultural sector work indifferently.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the statistics provided about women's employment in Turkey, specifically the registration status and the agricultural sector.

1. **45% of 8 million women employed in Turkey are registered**:
   - According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) and other labor force surveys, the labor force participation rate and registration status of women can be checked. Historically, the registration rate of women in the workforce has been a concern, with many women working informally.

2. **90% of women working in the agricultural sector work indifferently**:
   - This part of the claim is less clear due to the term ""indifferently."" If it means working informally or without proper registration, it aligns with known issues in the agricultural sector where informal employment is prevalent.

Given the historical context and available data, the claim seems to reflect ongoing issues in Turkey's labor market, particularly concerning women's employment and informal work in agriculture.

"Look at the point where the credit card debt increases in a year.Last year, this year, 3 million 103 thousand, now 5.6'ye increased.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific figures mentioned for credit card debt over the given time periods. The claim states that credit card debt increased from 3.103 million last year to 5.6 million this year.

1. **Last Year**: 3.103 million
2. **This Year**: 5.6 million

To evaluate this claim, we need to check the actual data on credit card debt for the specified years. If the data confirms that credit card debt was indeed 3.103 million last year and has increased to 5.6 million this year, then the claim would be true. If the figures are different, the claim would be false or partially true depending on the discrepancy.

Without access to the specific data, we can only assess the logical consistency of the claim based on the provided figures. Assuming the figures are accurate:

- The claim correctly identifies an increase in credit card debt from 3.103 million to 5.6 million.
- The increase is significant and the figures are specific.

Given the specificity and assuming the figures are accurate, the claim appears to be logically consistent.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
The minimum wage in Turkey has decreased to 280 dollars.Where is the minimum wage of $ 280 in Europe?,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the minimum wage in Turkey has decreased to $280 and to compare it with minimum wages in Europe, we need to consider the following:

1. **Current Minimum Wage in Turkey**: As of the latest data, the minimum wage in Turkey is set in Turkish Lira (TRY). The exchange rate between TRY and USD fluctuates, so the exact USD equivalent can vary. However, if we assume the claim is based on a recent exchange rate, it is plausible that the minimum wage could be around $280.

2. **Comparison with European Minimum Wages**: Minimum wages in Europe vary significantly from country to country. Western European countries generally have higher minimum wages, often exceeding $1,000 per month. However, some Eastern European countries have lower minimum wages, which can be closer to the $280 mark.

For example:
- Bulgaria has one of the lowest minimum wages in the EU, which is around €332 per month (approximately $350 as of recent exchange rates).
- Other countries like Romania and Hungary also have relatively low minimum wages compared to Western Europe but are generally higher than $280.

Given this context, the claim that the minimum wage in Turkey is $280 and comparing it to European minimum wages is somewhat accurate but lacks precision. The minimum wage in Turkey is indeed low compared to most European countries, but it is not the lowest in Europe.

2. **Time Frame**: Understand the specific time frame during which this increase is said to have occurred.
3. **Context**: Determine the baseline from which the 71% increase is calculated. For example, if the initial amount was very small, a 71% increase might not be as significant in absolute terms.
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the data with other periods or similar metrics to ensure the increase is not an anomaly or misrepresented.

Without access to specific data or sources, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a credible source and accurate data, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I would classify it as:

1. The number of tourists from Russia decreased by 645 thousand compared to the previous year's January-November period.
2. The tourism revenue loss amounted to $2.5 billion.

Without access to specific and up-to-date tourism statistics and financial data, it is challenging to definitively verify these figures. However, if we assume that the data provided is accurate and comes from a reliable source, the claim could be considered accurate.

1. The initial prediction for 2019 was 80 billion pounds.
2. The actual figure at the end of 2019 was 123 billion pounds.

If both of these points are correct, then the claim would be 'True'. If there are discrepancies in either the prediction or the actual figure, the claim would be rated accordingly.

Without specific context or sources to verify these numbers, we can only assess the logical consistency of the statement. The claim states that the prediction was 80 billion pounds and the actual figure was 123 billion pounds, which is a significant difference.

Given the information provided:

"""Reading.az"": The amount of carbon dioxide waste in Azerbaijan is always decreasing",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The amount of carbon dioxide waste in Azerbaijan is always decreasing,"" we need to examine data on carbon dioxide emissions in Azerbaijan over a period of time. 

1. **Historical Data**: Carbon dioxide emissions can fluctuate due to various factors such as economic activity, energy production methods, industrial output, and environmental policies.
2. **Trends**: If the data shows a consistent year-over-year decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, the claim could be considered true. However, if there are periods where emissions increased, the claim would not hold.

Given that carbon dioxide emissions are influenced by numerous factors and can vary from year to year, it is unlikely that emissions are ""always decreasing"" without any exceptions.

**Research Findings**:
- According to data from sources like the World Bank and other environmental monitoring organizations, Azerbaijan's carbon dioxide emissions have shown fluctuations over the years.
- For example, emissions might decrease in some years due to economic downturns or successful implementation of green policies, but they could increase in other years due to industrial growth or increased energy consumption.

Based on this understanding, the claim that the amount of carbon dioxide waste in Azerbaijan is ""always decreasing"" is not accurate.

The claim states that the number of files within the scope of sexual crimes increased to 32,991 in 2011, and the number of sexual abuse cases in 2011 was 33,993.

Given that the numbers are very close but not identical, it suggests a potential discrepancy or error in reporting. Without additional context or verification from a reliable source, it is difficult to confirm the exact figures.

Azerbaijan is not among 150 countries that want to help according to Coronavirus,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Azerbaijan is not among 150 countries that want to help according to Coronavirus,"" we need to consider the context and the specific details of the claim.

1. **Context**: The claim seems to be about international cooperation or aid related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. **Verification**: We need to check if there is a list of 150 countries that have pledged to help in some capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether Azerbaijan is included or excluded from that list.

Without specific details or a verified list of 150 countries, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, Azerbaijan has been involved in international efforts related to COVID-19, including receiving and providing aid, participating in global health initiatives, and collaborating with international organizations.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support the claim that Azerbaijan is excluded from a list of 150 countries willing to help, and considering Azerbaijan's known involvement in international COVID-19 efforts, the claim appears to be misleading.

2. Whether this number is indeed a record.

The phrase ""from business"" is ambiguous. It could mean people who have started a business, left a business, or been laid off from a business. For the sake of this analysis, let's assume it refers to people who have been laid off or left their jobs in the business sector.

To verify this claim, we would need reliable data from sources such as government labor statistics, industry reports, or credible news articles that provide the number of people who have left their jobs in the business sector over the past year and compare it to historical data to determine if it is indeed a record.

1. **Bar Association Membership Requirements**: Generally, becoming a member of a Bar Association involves meeting specific educational and professional criteria, such as obtaining a law degree, passing a bar examination, and fulfilling any additional requirements set by the jurisdiction's legal authority.

2. **Winning a Case at the European Court**: Winning a case at the European Court (such as the European Court of Human Rights or the Court of Justice of the European Union) is an achievement that reflects legal skill and expertise. However, it is not a formal requirement or a substitute for the standard criteria needed to become a member of a Bar Association.

Given these points, winning a case at the European Court is an impressive accomplishment but does not fulfill the formal requirements for Bar Association membership.

"The number of local newspapers, which was 1,950 five years ago, fell to 1,050 in 2018.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the numbers and the timeline provided.

1. The claim states that the number of local newspapers was 1,950 five years ago.
2. It also states that this number fell to 1,050 in 2018.

First, let's establish the timeline:
- If we consider ""five years ago"" from 2018, that would be 2013.

Next, we need to verify the numbers:
- According to various reports and studies on the state of local newspapers, there has been a significant decline in the number of local newspapers over the past decade. However, specific numbers can vary depending on the source.

Based on available data:
- In 2013, the number of local newspapers was indeed higher than in 2018, but the exact number of 1,950 may not be universally agreed upon.
- By 2018, the number of local newspapers had indeed fallen significantly, with some reports indicating numbers around 1,300 to 1,400, but not exactly 1,050.

Given the information, the claim is somewhat accurate but not precise in its numbers.

"Before Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, there were no 3 -fate of the universities today.The dormitories already had no 3 -fate of the dormitories",mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Before Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, there were no 3-fate of the universities today.""
2. ""The dormitories already had no 3-fate of the dormitories.""

The phrasing ""3-fate"" is unclear and seems to be a mistranslation or typo. Assuming ""3-fate"" might refer to a specific condition or status, we need to consider the context of Turkish universities and dormitories before and after Erdoğan's tenure.

1. **Universities Before Erdoğan:**
   - Before Erdoğan, Turkey had a number of universities, but the expansion and modernization of higher education institutions have been significant during his tenure. Erdoğan's government has established many new universities and increased the capacity of existing ones.
   - However, it is not accurate to say there were ""no"" universities before Erdoğan. Turkey had a well-established higher education system with several universities.

2. **Dormitories Before Erdoğan:**
   - Dormitories existed before Erdoğan, but similar to universities, there has been significant investment and expansion in student housing during his tenure.
   - Again, it is not accurate to say there were ""no"" dormitories before Erdoğan.

Given these points, the claim that there were no universities or dormitories before Erdoğan is an exaggeration. There were universities and dormitories, but their number and capacity have increased under Erdoğan's administration.

Türkiye began to make the world's longest bridge on the Marmara Sea.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye began to make the world's longest bridge on the Marmara Sea,"" we need to consider the specifics of the bridge in question and compare it to other bridges worldwide.

The 1915 Çanakkale Bridge, which spans the Dardanelles Strait (part of the Marmara Sea region), is a significant project in Türkiye. It is notable for having the longest main span of any suspension bridge in the world, measuring 2,023 meters (6,637 feet). However, the term ""world's longest bridge"" can be interpreted in different ways, such as total length versus main span length.

If we consider the total length of a bridge, the Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge in China, which is a viaduct on the Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway, holds the record at approximately 164.8 kilometers (102.4 miles).

Given this context, the claim that Türkiye began to make the ""world's longest bridge"" is not entirely accurate if we consider the total length of the bridge. However, it is true that Türkiye's 1915 Çanakkale Bridge has the longest main span of any suspension bridge.

"8.4 percent unemployment rate in 2001 was the most intense of the crisis.We are coming to 2016, the unemployment rate is 18 percent. Unemployment in university graduates is 27.3 percent.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the unemployment rates for the years mentioned.

1. **Unemployment Rate in 2001**: The claim states that the unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in 2001. According to historical data from sources like the World Bank and the International Labour Organization, the global unemployment rate in 2001 was around 6.1 percent. However, specific countries may have had different rates. For example, in the United States, the unemployment rate in 2001 was around 4.7 percent. Therefore, the 8.4 percent figure might be specific to a particular country experiencing a crisis.

2. **Unemployment Rate in 2016**: The claim states that the unemployment rate in 2016 was 18 percent. This figure is significantly higher than the global average, which was around 5.7 percent in 2016. However, certain countries, particularly those experiencing economic difficulties, could have had higher unemployment rates. For instance, Greece had an unemployment rate of around 23.5 percent in 2016.

3. **Unemployment Rate for University Graduates in 2016**: The claim states that the unemployment rate for university graduates was 27.3 percent in 2016. This figure is plausible for countries with high overall unemployment rates, such as Greece or Spain, where youth and graduate unemployment rates were particularly high.

Given the variability in unemployment rates across different countries and the lack of specific country context in the claim, it is challenging to definitively verify the exact figures without more detailed information. However, the figures mentioned are plausible for certain countries experiencing economic crises.

We Share First And Second Places in the Post-Soviet Space.In Neighbouring Countries Average Pension Is Approximately 70 AZN,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We Share First And Second Places in the Post-Soviet Space. In Neighbouring Countries Average Pension Is Approximately 70 AZN,"" we need to evaluate two main components:

1. **Ranking in the Post-Soviet Space**: This part of the claim suggests that the entity in question (presumably a country) ranks first or second in some metric within the post-Soviet states. The specific metric is not mentioned, so it could be related to pensions, economic performance, or another measure.

2. **Average Pension in Neighbouring Countries**: This part of the claim states that the average pension in neighboring countries is approximately 70 AZN (Azerbaijani Manat).

### Analysis:

1. **Ranking in the Post-Soviet Space**:
   - Without a specific metric, it's challenging to verify this part of the claim. However, if we assume it refers to pensions, we would need data on pension rankings among post-Soviet states. Countries like Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic states typically have higher pensions compared to others in the region.

2. **Average Pension in Neighbouring Countries**:
   - Azerbaijan's neighboring countries include Armenia, Georgia, Iran, Russia, and Turkey. The average pension in these countries varies significantly:
     - Armenia: The average pension is higher than 70 AZN.
     - Georgia: The average pension is also higher than 70 AZN.
     - Iran: The pension system is different, but the average pension is generally higher than 70 AZN.
     - Russia: The average pension is significantly higher than 70 AZN.
     - Turkey: The average pension is also higher than 70 AZN.

Given the data, the claim that the average pension in neighboring countries is approximately 70 AZN is not accurate.

### Conclusion:
The claim is not supported by the available data on pensions in neighboring countries, and the ranking in the post-Soviet space is too vague to verify without a specific metric.

"The spread of citizens in military units is a violation of the law ""On State Secret""",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The spread of citizens in military units is a violation of the law 'On State Secret',"" we need to consider the context and specifics of the law ""On State Secret.""

The law ""On State Secret"" typically pertains to the protection of information that is deemed critical to national security. This can include military secrets, state security operations, and other sensitive information. The exact provisions of the law can vary by country, but generally, it aims to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of classified information.

If the ""spread of citizens in military units"" refers to the dissemination of information about the composition, deployment, or other sensitive details of military units, then it is likely that such information would be classified under the law ""On State Secret."" Unauthorized disclosure of this information could indeed be considered a violation of the law.

However, without specific details about the law in question and the exact nature of the information being spread, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. Assuming the law ""On State Secret"" includes provisions for protecting military information, the claim would be accurate.

"Türkiye 35 milyon ""Facebook"" kullanıcısıyla ABD'nin ardından dünyada 2'nci sırada yer almaktadır.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye 35 milyon 'Facebook' kullanıcısıyla ABD'nin ardından dünyada 2'nci sırada yer almaktadır,"" we need to look at the most recent data on Facebook user statistics by country.

As of the latest available data, the countries with the highest number of Facebook users are typically:

1. India
2. United States
3. Indonesia
4. Brazil
5. Mexico

Türkiye (Turkey) does have a significant number of Facebook users, but it is not the second-largest in the world. The number of Facebook users in Turkey is also not 35 million; it is generally reported to be lower than that.

Given this information, the claim that Turkey is second in the world for Facebook users with 35 million users is not accurate.

"According to the inner regulation (question proposals) should be answered within 15 days.20 months, three years of questions that have not been answered.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""According to the inner regulation (question proposals) should be answered within 15 days.""
2. ""20 months, three years of questions that have not been answered.""

For the first part, if the inner regulation indeed states that question proposals should be answered within 15 days, then this part is true. However, without specific access to the inner regulation document, we cannot confirm this definitively.

For the second part, it claims that there are questions that have not been answered for 20 months and three years. This suggests a significant delay beyond the 15-day requirement. If there is evidence to support that questions have indeed been pending for such extended periods, this part would also be true.

Given the information provided, and assuming the inner regulation does state a 15-day response time and there are documented cases of questions pending for 20 months and three years, the claim would be 'True'. However, without direct evidence or access to the inner regulation and the status of the questions, we can only partially verify the claim.

Unemployment came to 12 percent.There was no such unemployment during any crisis.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Unemployment came to 12 percent. There was no such unemployment during any crisis,"" we need to consider historical unemployment data during various crises.

1. **Great Depression (1929-1939)**: Unemployment rates in the United States reached as high as 25% during the peak of the Great Depression.
2. **Great Recession (2007-2009)**: Unemployment rates in the United States peaked at around 10% in October 2009.
3. **COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)**: Unemployment rates in the United States surged to 14.8% in April 2020.

Given this information, the claim that ""There was no such unemployment during any crisis"" is incorrect because there have been crises with higher unemployment rates than 12%.

"From 1986 to 2015, when privatizations started in Turkey, sales of $ 65 billion made.57 billion dollars of 87 percent of this was made during the AKP period.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The total sales from privatizations in Turkey from 1986 to 2015 amounted to $65 billion.
2. $57 billion of this total was made during the AKP (Justice and Development Party) period.
3. $57 billion represents 87% of the total $65 billion.

Let's break down the claim:

1. **Total Sales from Privatizations**: According to various sources, including reports from the Turkish Privatization Administration, the total revenue from privatizations in Turkey from 1986 to 2015 is indeed around $65 billion.

2. **Sales During the AKP Period**: The AKP came to power in 2002. Reports indicate that a significant portion of the privatization revenue was generated during the AKP period. Specifically, sources suggest that around $57 billion was generated from privatizations during this time.

3. **Percentage Calculation**: To verify the percentage:
   \[
   \frac{57 \text{ billion}}{65 \text{ billion}} \approx 0.8769 \text{ or } 87.69\%
   \]
   This calculation confirms that $57 billion is approximately 87% of $65 billion.

Given that all parts of the claim check out with available data, the claim is accurate.

"For the first time, the opposition was elected Deputy Chairman of the Milli Majlis",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""For the first time, the opposition was elected Deputy Chairman of the Milli Majlis,"" we need to verify historical records and recent events related to the Milli Majlis, which is the National Assembly of Azerbaijan.

The Milli Majlis has had various Deputy Chairmen over the years, and the political affiliations of these individuals can be checked to see if any were from opposition parties. If this is indeed the first instance of an opposition member being elected to this position, the claim would be true.

After reviewing available information, it appears that in March 2020, Fazail Agamali, a member of the opposition party, was elected as one of the Deputy Chairmen of the Milli Majlis. This event marked a significant moment in the political landscape of Azerbaijan.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
We increased our economy from 8 percent to 32 percent with neighbors,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We increased our economy from 8 percent to 32 percent with neighbors,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Specifics**: The claim lacks context. What does ""increased our economy"" mean? Is it referring to GDP growth, trade volume, or some other economic indicator? Additionally, the term ""with neighbors"" is vague. Does it mean trade with neighboring countries, economic cooperation, or something else?

2. **Data Verification**: Without specific data or a timeframe, it's challenging to verify the claim. Economic growth rates and trade volumes can vary significantly over different periods and contexts.

3. **Plausibility**: An increase from 8 percent to 32 percent is a substantial change. Such a significant increase would typically be well-documented and likely to be reported in economic analyses or news sources.

Given the lack of specific details and verifiable data, the claim cannot be substantiated as presented.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The votes of the Vatan Party grew between five floors and ten times in all southeastern provinces.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The votes of the Vatan Party grew between five floors and ten times in all southeastern provinces,"" we need to analyze the election data for the Vatan Party in the southeastern provinces over the relevant election periods.

1. **Identify the Southeastern Provinces**: Typically, southeastern provinces in Turkey include Adıyaman, Batman, Diyarbakır, Gaziantep, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, Şanlıurfa, Şırnak, and Van.

2. **Examine Election Data**: We need to compare the vote counts for the Vatan Party in these provinces across two consecutive elections to see if there was an increase of at least five times and up to ten times.

3. **Data Verification**: If the data shows that in all these provinces, the Vatan Party's votes increased by at least five times and up to ten times, the claim would be true. If the increase is less than five times in any province or more than ten times, the claim would be false.

Without access to the specific election data, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the general knowledge of the Vatan Party's performance in elections, it is unlikely that such a significant increase occurred uniformly across all southeastern provinces.

Without access to the exact data or sources, I cannot definitively confirm or refute these numbers.

However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, the statement would be 'True'. If there is any discrepancy in the figures or if the context is misrepresented, the classification would change accordingly.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, I cannot provide a definitive answer. 

Final Answer: Unable to determine.",,False,True
20% of Azerbaijan's Territories ARE Under Occupation,mostly false,az,"The claim that ""20% of Azerbaijan's territories are under occupation"" primarily refers to the situation involving the Nagorno-Karabakh region and surrounding districts. Historically, this region has been a point of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Following the First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988-1994), Armenian forces controlled Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts, which amounted to approximately 20% of Azerbaijan's internationally recognized territory.

However, the situation changed significantly after the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. Azerbaijan regained control over several of these territories, although the status of Nagorno-Karabakh itself remains complex and partially unresolved.

Given the historical context and the recent changes in territorial control, the claim that ""20% of Azerbaijan's territories are under occupation"" is outdated and no longer accurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The army of the Republic of Turkey NATO's largest army is the 3rd largest army in the world if I'm not mistaken.,false,tr,"The claim that the army of the Republic of Turkey is NATO's largest army and the 3rd largest army in the world is not accurate.

1. **NATO's Largest Army**: The United States has the largest army within NATO, not Turkey. Turkey has one of the largest armies in NATO, but it is not the largest.

2. **3rd Largest Army in the World**: As of the latest data, the largest armies in the world by active military personnel are typically China, India, and the United States. Turkey does not rank as the 3rd largest army in the world.

Given these points, the claim is incorrect on both counts.

"In the 27th term legislative council, the rate of female MPs increased by 25 %.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In the 27th term legislative council, the rate of female MPs increased by 25%,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Baseline Data**: What was the percentage of female MPs in the previous term (26th term)?
2. **Current Data**: What is the percentage of female MPs in the 27th term?
3. **Calculation**: Verify if the increase is indeed 25%.

For example, if the percentage of female MPs in the 26th term was 20%, a 25% increase would mean the new percentage is 20% + (25% of 20%) = 20% + 5% = 25%.

Without specific data on the percentage of female MPs in both the 26th and 27th terms, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and the increase is correctly calculated, the claim could be considered true.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, based on the information provided:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"""Fact Check"" Chekcs The Statements of President About Azerbaijan's Army",mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""'Fact Check' Checks The Statements of President About Azerbaijan's Army,"" we need to consider the context and the specific statements being referenced. However, based on the information provided, it is not clear what specific statements are being fact-checked or what the findings of the fact-check are.

Given the lack of specific details, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, the claim that a fact-checking entity is examining statements made by the President about Azerbaijan's army is plausible, as fact-checking organizations often review statements made by public officials.

"""Easy service"" is an example for the world",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Easy service is an example for the world,"" we need to consider the context and the evidence supporting it. The phrase ""example for the world"" implies that ""easy service"" is a model or standard that others should follow or learn from globally.

1. **True**: This would mean that ""easy service"" is universally recognized and adopted as a standard of excellence worldwide.
2. **Mostly True**: This would mean that ""easy service"" is widely recognized and adopted in many parts of the world, but not universally.
3. **Half True**: This would mean that ""easy service"" is recognized and adopted in some parts of the world, but not widely.
4. **Mostly False**: This would mean that ""easy service"" is recognized and adopted in a few places, but not enough to be considered an example for the world.
5. **False**: This would mean that ""easy service"" is not recognized or adopted as a standard of excellence anywhere in the world.

Without specific evidence or context about what ""easy service"" refers to and its global recognition or adoption, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given the general nature of the statement and the lack of specific evidence, it is reasonable to assume that ""easy service"" is not universally recognized as a global standard.

"While the population of the country increased by 35 million since 1980, the presence of animals, which was 85 million on the same date, decreased to 53 million in 2016, and the pasture areas, which were 28.7 million hectares in 1960, decreased to 14.6 million hectares in 2016.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The population of the country increased by 35 million since 1980.
2. The presence of animals was 85 million in 1980 and decreased to 53 million in 2016.
3. The pasture areas were 28.7 million hectares in 1960 and decreased to 14.6 million hectares in 2016.

Without access to specific data sources or databases to verify these exact figures, I can only assess the logical consistency and plausibility of the claim based on general trends and known data patterns.

1. Population Increase: Many countries have experienced significant population growth since 1980, so an increase of 35 million is plausible for a large country.
2. Animal Population Decrease: It is plausible that the number of animals could have decreased due to various factors such as urbanization, changes in agricultural practices, and environmental degradation.
3. Decrease in Pasture Areas: It is also plausible that pasture areas have decreased over time due to urban expansion, deforestation, and changes in land use.

Given that the claim aligns with general trends observed in many countries, it seems plausible but requires specific data for full verification.

The highest absenteeism rate is in these schools (imam orators).The absenteeism in imam orators reached thirty percent and is going to record.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The absenteeism rate in imam orator schools.
2. Whether this rate is indeed the highest compared to other types of schools.
3. If the rate has reached thirty percent and is on record.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the structure and the need for verification, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the claim, it is prudent to approach it with skepticism. The claim makes a specific assertion about the absenteeism rate and its comparison to other schools, which requires reliable data to substantiate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,True,False
"In the period of 2003-2006, 7 important international agreements have been sides in this field in order to combat corruption.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the number of important international agreements signed specifically to combat corruption between 2003 and 2006.

1. **United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)**: Adopted in 2003 and came into force in 2005. This is a significant international agreement aimed at combating corruption.

2. **Council of Europe’s Criminal Law Convention on Corruption**: Although adopted in 1999, it continued to be signed and ratified by various countries during the 2003-2006 period.

3. **Council of Europe’s Civil Law Convention on Corruption**: Similar to the Criminal Law Convention, it was adopted earlier (in 1999) but saw continued signings and ratifications in the 2003-2006 period.

4. **African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption**: Adopted in 2003 and came into force in 2006.

5. **Inter-American Convention against Corruption**: Adopted in 1996, but continued to be relevant and saw further signings and ratifications in the 2003-2006 period.

6. **OECD Anti-Bribery Convention**: Adopted in 1997, but continued to see new signatories and ratifications during the 2003-2006 period.

7. **Additional Protocol to the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption**: Adopted in 2003 and aimed at further strengthening the fight against corruption.

Given these agreements, it is clear that there were several significant international agreements either adopted or actively signed and ratified during the 2003-2006 period. However, the exact number of ""7 important international agreements"" specifically adopted in this period is not entirely accurate, as some of these agreements were adopted earlier but continued to be relevant.

Formula 1 Race Brings Great Economic Dividends to Our Country,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Formula 1 Race Brings Great Economic Dividends to Our Country,"" we need to consider various factors such as the economic impact of hosting a Formula 1 race, including tourism, local business revenue, job creation, and long-term investments.

1. **Tourism**: Hosting a Formula 1 race typically attracts a large number of international and domestic tourists, which can significantly boost local hospitality industries, including hotels, restaurants, and transportation services.

2. **Local Business Revenue**: The influx of visitors and media attention can lead to increased spending in local businesses, from retail stores to entertainment venues.

3. **Job Creation**: The event can create temporary jobs related to the race itself (e.g., event staff, security, vendors) and potentially lead to longer-term employment opportunities in the tourism and service sectors.

4. **Long-term Investments**: Hosting a high-profile event like a Formula 1 race can lead to infrastructure improvements (e.g., roads, public transport) and can enhance the country's global profile, potentially attracting future investments and events.

However, it is also important to consider the costs involved in hosting such an event, including the fees paid to Formula 1, infrastructure costs, and potential disruptions to local communities.

Given these points, the claim that a Formula 1 race brings ""great economic dividends"" is generally supported by evidence, though the extent of the economic benefits can vary depending on the specific context and execution.

"Do Likes, Opinions and Sharing Eliminate Complaints in Facebook?",false,az,"To evaluate the claim ""Do Likes, Opinions and Sharing Eliminate Complaints in Facebook?"", we need to consider the nature of social media interactions and user behavior on Facebook.

1. **Likes**: While likes can indicate approval or agreement, they do not necessarily eliminate complaints. Users can still post complaints regardless of the number of likes a post receives.

2. **Opinions**: Sharing opinions can lead to discussions and debates, which might include complaints. Expressing opinions does not inherently eliminate complaints; it can sometimes even generate more complaints.

3. **Sharing**: Sharing content can amplify its reach, but it does not prevent users from complaining. In fact, sharing controversial or negative content can lead to more complaints as it reaches a wider audience.

Given these points, the claim that likes, opinions, and sharing eliminate complaints on Facebook is not accurate. These actions do not inherently prevent or eliminate complaints; they are simply different forms of engagement that can coexist with complaints.

"In other words, the only success story of the 77 elections, which the CHP mentioned in the last 55 years as the historical victory in the last 55 years, is the first, it is under the line we have reached.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the historical context and electoral performance of the CHP (Republican People's Party) in Turkey over the past 55 years, particularly focusing on the 1977 elections.

1. **Historical Context**: The CHP is one of Turkey's oldest political parties, founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Over the years, it has experienced various degrees of success and failure in elections.

2. **1977 Elections**: The 1977 general elections in Turkey were significant for the CHP. Under the leadership of Bülent Ecevit, the CHP won 41.4% of the vote, securing 213 out of 450 seats in the parliament. This was a notable victory and is often cited as a major success in the party's history.

3. **Subsequent Elections**: Since 1977, the CHP has faced various challenges and has not consistently achieved similar levels of electoral success. The party has had periods of both decline and resurgence, but the 1977 election remains a high point in its electoral history.

4. **Claim Analysis**: The claim suggests that the 1977 election is the only significant success story for the CHP in the last 55 years and that it is the benchmark against which current achievements are measured.

Given this context, the claim appears to be an oversimplification. While the 1977 election was indeed a significant victory, the CHP has had other notable moments and successes, albeit not always to the same extent. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate but contains elements of truth.

"We were looking at employment, 19.6 million people, when we arrived, 28 million 80 thousand",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the employment figures mentioned. The claim states that employment was at 19.6 million people when ""we"" arrived and increased to 28 million 80 thousand.

1. **Initial Employment Figure (19.6 million):**
   - Verify the employment figure at the starting point (when ""we"" arrived).

2. **Current Employment Figure (28 million 80 thousand):**
   - Verify the employment figure at the current point.

Without specific context or dates, it's challenging to verify these numbers precisely. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a specific period and the figures are accurate, we can assess the claim based on available data from reliable sources such as government labor statistics or reputable economic reports.

Given the lack of specific dates and context, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if the figures are reasonably close to known data, the claim could be considered accurate.

**Assumptions:**
- The figures are based on official employment statistics.
- The period in question is clearly defined and matches the data.

**Verification Steps:**
1. Check historical employment data from a reliable source (e.g., Bureau of Labor Statistics, national labor reports).
2. Compare the figures provided in the claim with the verified data.

If the figures align closely with the verified data, the claim can be considered accurate. If there are significant discrepancies, the claim would be less accurate.

**Example Verification:**
- If historical data shows employment was around 19.6 million at the starting point and increased to approximately 28 million, the claim is likely accurate.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, we can only make a general assessment.

Not among the reasons for insulting the President in accordance with CMK,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Not among the reasons for insulting the President in accordance with CMK,"" we need to understand what ""CMK"" refers to and whether it provides any reasons or justifications for insulting the President.

If ""CMK"" refers to a specific legal code, document, or set of guidelines, we would need to review that source to see if it lists any reasons for insulting the President. Generally, legal codes and official documents do not provide justifications for insulting a head of state, as such actions are typically considered disrespectful and may be subject to legal penalties.

Without specific information about what ""CMK"" stands for and its contents, it is reasonable to assume that it does not provide reasons for insulting the President.

The transfer of Armenians to Nagorno-Karabakh is a war crime,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The transfer of Armenians to Nagorno-Karabakh is a war crime,"" we need to consider the context and relevant international laws.

1. **International Law and War Crimes**: According to the Geneva Conventions and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, war crimes include acts such as the forced transfer or deportation of civilians during an armed conflict. However, the term ""war crime"" is specific and requires certain conditions to be met, such as the presence of an armed conflict and the intent to forcibly transfer a population.

2. **Historical and Political Context**: Nagorno-Karabakh is a region with a complex history involving territorial disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The transfer of populations in this context could be seen as part of broader geopolitical strategies rather than a straightforward case of forced transfer under duress.

3. **Voluntary vs. Forced Transfer**: If Armenians are moving to Nagorno-Karabakh voluntarily, it would not constitute a war crime. However, if they are being forcibly transferred or deported against their will, it could potentially be classified as a war crime under international law.

Given the complexity and the need for specific conditions to be met for an act to be classified as a war crime, the claim cannot be definitively categorized without more detailed information on the nature of the transfer.

"Look at the political history of the last 50 years, Turkey's growth rate alone is twice as much as the coalition periods.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Turkey's growth rate alone is twice as much as the coalition periods"" over the last 50 years, we need to examine Turkey's economic growth rates during periods of single-party rule versus coalition governments.

1. **Historical Context**:
   - Turkey has experienced both single-party rule and coalition governments over the past 50 years.
   - Notable periods of single-party rule include the Justice and Development Party (AKP) from 2002 onwards.
   - Coalition governments were common in the 1990s and early 2000s.

2. **Economic Growth Data**:
   - During the AKP's rule (2002-2023), Turkey's average annual GDP growth rate has been around 5%.
   - During the coalition periods in the 1990s, Turkey's economic growth was more volatile, with lower average growth rates and economic crises, such as the 1994 and 2001 financial crises.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - The average growth rate during the coalition periods in the 1990s was significantly lower, often around 2-3%.
   - Comparing these figures, the growth rate during single-party rule (especially under the AKP) is indeed approximately twice as high as during the coalition periods.

Given this analysis, the claim that ""Turkey's growth rate alone is twice as much as the coalition periods"" is supported by historical economic data.

Roads in Azerbaijan are being built with high quality,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Roads in Azerbaijan are being built with high quality,"" we need to consider various factors such as recent infrastructure projects, government reports, independent assessments, and user experiences.

1. **Government Reports and Investments**: The Azerbaijani government has been investing significantly in infrastructure, including road construction. There have been numerous projects aimed at improving the quality and connectivity of roads across the country.

2. **International Assessments**: Organizations like the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the World Bank often assess the quality of infrastructure in different countries. According to the WEF's Global Competitiveness Report, Azerbaijan has made improvements in its infrastructure, including roads.

3. **User Experiences and Independent Reviews**: While official reports may highlight improvements, user experiences and independent reviews can provide a more nuanced picture. There have been mixed reviews from locals and travelers, with some praising the new roads and others pointing out issues with maintenance and quality in certain areas.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compared to some neighboring countries, Azerbaijan has made notable progress in road construction. However, there may still be areas that require further improvement.

Considering these points, the claim that ""Roads in Azerbaijan are being built with high quality"" appears to be generally supported by government initiatives and some international assessments, but there are also areas that may not fully meet high-quality standards.

"For the first time in 22 years, we witness the curfew in the new Turkey.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""For the first time in 22 years, we witness the curfew in the new Turkey,"" we need to consider historical events and the context of curfews in Turkey over the past 22 years.

1. **Historical Context**: Turkey has experienced various curfews over the years, often due to political unrest, security concerns, or public health emergencies.
2. **Recent Curfews**: For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Turkey imposed several curfews and lockdowns to control the spread of the virus. These curfews were implemented in 2020 and 2021, which is within the last 22 years.
3. **Political and Security Curfews**: Additionally, Turkey has imposed curfews in certain regions due to security operations, particularly in the southeastern part of the country where there have been conflicts with Kurdish groups.

Given this information, the claim that this is the first curfew in 22 years is not accurate.

"The 12 -month current account deficit reached $ 51.6 billion.Almost 6 percent of GDP!In economies that resemble us, this rate is almost one -third.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The 12-month current account deficit reached $51.6 billion. Almost 6 percent of GDP!""
2. ""In economies that resemble us, this rate is almost one-third.""

### Part 1: Current Account Deficit and GDP
- **$51.6 billion current account deficit**: This is a specific figure that can be verified through economic reports or data from financial institutions.
- **Almost 6 percent of GDP**: To verify this, we need to know the GDP of the country in question. If the GDP is approximately $860 billion (since $51.6 billion is 6% of $860 billion), then this part of the claim could be accurate.

### Part 2: Comparison with Similar Economies
- **Economies that resemble us**: This is a bit subjective, but typically refers to countries with similar economic structures, sizes, or stages of development.
- **Rate is almost one-third**: This implies that in similar economies, the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP is around 2% (one-third of 6%).

### Verification
- **Data Sources**: We would need to look at economic data from similar countries to see if their current account deficits are around 2% of GDP.
- **Economic Reports**: Reports from the IMF, World Bank, or other financial institutions can provide this comparative data.

### Conclusion
Without specific data to verify the exact figures, we can make an educated guess based on typical economic patterns and available information.

"Last year, the share of small and medium-sized businesses in the field of employment was 76 percent",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Last year, the share of small and medium-sized businesses in the field of employment was 76 percent,"" we need to verify the specific data regarding the employment share of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for the previous year. This information can typically be found in reports from government agencies, economic research institutions, or reputable business organizations.

Without access to the specific data for the previous year, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can provide some context: SMEs often represent a significant portion of employment in many economies. For example, in the European Union, SMEs account for around two-thirds of total employment. In the United States, SMEs also employ a substantial share of the workforce, though the exact percentage can vary.

Given this context, a figure of 76 percent is plausible but may vary depending on the country and the specific definition of SMEs used.

Türkiye was one of the countries with positive decomposition according to all the countries of the economy during the normalization period.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to understand what is meant by ""positive decomposition"" and ""normalization period"" in the context of Türkiye's economy. 

1. **Positive Decomposition**: This term typically refers to a positive breakdown or analysis of economic factors, indicating that various components of the economy are contributing positively to overall economic performance.

2. **Normalization Period**: This likely refers to the period following a significant disruption, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, when economies were transitioning back to normal operations.

To verify the claim, we would need to look at economic reports and analyses from reputable sources (such as the World Bank, IMF, or national economic reports) that evaluate Türkiye's economic performance during the specified period.

However, without specific data or reports to reference, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. Given the general nature of the statement and the lack of specific evidence provided, it is difficult to fully validate or refute it.

All opportunities and conditions have been created in Azerbaijan to operate NGOs,false,az,"Final Answer: Mostly False

Explanation: While Azerbaijan has a legal framework that allows for the operation of NGOs, there are significant restrictions and challenges that NGOs face in practice. These include stringent registration requirements, limitations on foreign funding, and government interference. International organizations and human rights groups have frequently criticized Azerbaijan for its restrictive environment for civil society organizations. Therefore, the claim that ""all opportunities and conditions have been created in Azerbaijan to operate NGOs"" does not fully reflect the reality on the ground.",,False,True
Exports fell by 11 percent in January 13 months in a row and fell to below 10 billion dollars per month.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. ""Exports fell by 11 percent in January.""
2. ""13 months in a row.""
3. ""Fell to below 10 billion dollars per month.""

Without specific data to verify these points, we can analyze the logical consistency and typical economic reporting patterns.

1. It is plausible for exports to fall by a certain percentage in a given month.
2. The phrase ""13 months in a row"" suggests a continuous decline over more than a year, which is unusual but not impossible.
3. Falling below a specific monetary threshold (10 billion dollars) is also plausible but would need specific data for confirmation.

Given the structure of the claim, it seems to mix different time frames and metrics in a confusing way. For instance, ""Exports fell by 11 percent in January"" is a specific monthly change, while ""13 months in a row"" suggests a longer-term trend. Additionally, ""fell to below 10 billion dollars per month"" is a specific threshold that would need consistent data to verify.

Without concrete data, the claim appears to be internally inconsistent and potentially misleading.

"(Turkey) experienced inflation periods with 2 digits or 3 digits for 34 years ... Single -digit figure was seen in 2004 ... In 2012, the lowest rate of the last 44 years of the figure reached in inflation",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the historical inflation data for Turkey.

1. **Inflation Periods with 2 or 3 Digits for 34 Years**: Turkey experienced high inflation rates, often in double or triple digits, particularly from the late 1970s through the early 2000s. This period of high inflation lasted for approximately 34 years.

2. **Single-Digit Inflation in 2004**: Turkey managed to bring inflation down to single digits in 2004. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, the inflation rate in 2004 was around 9.32%.

3. **Lowest Rate in 2012**: The claim states that the lowest inflation rate in the last 44 years was reached in 2012. According to available data, the inflation rate in 2012 was around 6.16%, which was indeed one of the lowest rates in recent decades.

Given these points, the claim appears to be accurate based on historical data.

"The number of midwives falling to 100 thousand people in Turkey is 252.However, in EU countries, 836 people are 836 people.So it is more than three times.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the statistics provided for the number of midwives per 100,000 people in Turkey and EU countries.

1. **Turkey**: The claim states that there are 252 midwives per 100,000 people.
2. **EU Countries**: The claim states that there are 836 midwives per 100,000 people.

The claim also asserts that the number of midwives in EU countries is more than three times that in Turkey.

Let's break down the comparison:
- If Turkey has 252 midwives per 100,000 people, then three times this number would be 252 * 3 = 756 midwives per 100,000 people.
- The claim states that the EU has 836 midwives per 100,000 people, which is indeed more than 756.

Given that the numbers provided (252 for Turkey and 836 for the EU) are accurate, the statement that the number of midwives in the EU is more than three times that in Turkey is correct.

**Verification**:
- If the numbers are accurate, the comparison holds true.
- If the numbers are not accurate, the claim would be false.

Assuming the numbers are accurate, the claim is correct.

2. The criteria for being ""first place"" within this council (e.g., volume of transport, efficiency, network size, etc.).
3. The current standings or rankings within this council.

People in quarantine are kept in 4 and 5 star hotels,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""People in quarantine are kept in 4 and 5 star hotels,"" we need to consider the context and variability of quarantine practices across different regions and situations.

1. **Contextual Variability**: Quarantine practices can vary widely depending on the country, the specific circumstances of the quarantine (e.g., government-mandated quarantine for travelers, quarantine for COVID-19 patients, etc.), and the resources available.

2. **Examples**:
   - In some countries, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, travelers were indeed placed in 4 and 5 star hotels for quarantine. For instance, Australia and New Zealand used hotels, including high-end ones, for mandatory quarantine.
   - In other regions, quarantine facilities might include a range of accommodations from budget hotels to more luxurious ones, or even government-run facilities that are not hotels at all.

3. **Generalization**: The claim suggests a general practice, but in reality, the type of accommodation can vary significantly. While some people in quarantine have been kept in 4 and 5 star hotels, this is not universally true for all quarantine situations.

Given this variability, the claim cannot be considered entirely true or entirely false. It holds some truth but is not universally applicable.

Türkiye is the most generous country in the world.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Türkiye is the most generous country in the world,"" we need to consider various metrics and sources that measure generosity. One widely recognized source is the World Giving Index, published by the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF). This index measures generosity based on three main criteria: helping a stranger, donating money, and volunteering time.

According to the World Giving Index, Türkiye has ranked highly in certain years, particularly in terms of the proportion of national income given as humanitarian aid. However, it is important to note that the ranking can vary year by year and depends on the specific criteria being measured.

For instance, in some years, Türkiye has been noted for its significant contributions to humanitarian aid, especially in response to crises in neighboring regions. However, when considering broader measures of generosity, such as individual acts of giving and volunteering, other countries like the United States, Myanmar, and New Zealand have often ranked higher.

Given this context, the claim that ""Türkiye is the most generous country in the world"" can be seen as an overstatement if taken without qualification. While Türkiye is indeed very generous in certain aspects, particularly in humanitarian aid, it may not consistently rank as the most generous country across all measures of generosity.

Nowadays People Are Not Scared About The Future of Their Children,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Nowadays People Are Not Scared About The Future of Their Children,"" we need to consider various factors such as societal trends, economic conditions, environmental concerns, and general sentiment among parents and guardians.

1. **Economic Concerns**: Many parents are worried about the economic future of their children due to rising costs of education, housing, and healthcare. Economic instability and job market uncertainties are common concerns.

2. **Environmental Concerns**: Climate change and environmental degradation are significant worries for many parents. The future livability of the planet is a major concern for the next generation.

3. **Social and Political Climate**: Issues such as political instability, social inequality, and global conflicts can also contribute to parental anxiety about the future.

4. **Technological Changes**: Rapid technological advancements and their impact on job markets and social interactions can be a source of concern for parents.

Given these points, it is clear that many people do have concerns about the future of their children. While there may be some who are less worried due to personal circumstances or optimism, the general trend suggests that a significant number of people are indeed concerned.

You write that wetlands are decreasing.We increased the area we bought as 9 million hectares to 30 million.We increased 3 times.Natural parks increased by 10 times.The number of national parks has increased.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down each part and verify it against available data:

1. **Wetlands are decreasing**: According to numerous environmental studies and reports from organizations like the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the United Nations, wetlands globally have been decreasing due to factors such as urbanization, agriculture, and climate change.

2. **We increased the area we bought as 9 million hectares to 30 million**: This statement needs context. If ""we"" refers to a specific country or organization, we would need to verify this claim with relevant data from that entity. Without specific context, it's challenging to validate this part of the claim.

3. **We increased 3 times**: If the area increased from 9 million hectares to 30 million hectares, this is indeed more than a threefold increase (30/9 ≈ 3.33).

4. **Natural parks increased by 10 times**: This statement also requires specific context. If referring to a particular country or region, we would need to check the relevant data. Generally, such a significant increase in natural parks would be notable and likely documented.

5. **The number of national parks has increased**: This is a broad statement and likely true in many regions as conservation efforts have increased globally. However, the extent of the increase would vary by country and region.

Given the lack of specific context and verifiable data for some parts of the claim, we can only partially validate it. The general trend of wetland decrease is well-documented, but the specific figures for land acquisition and park increases need more precise information.

1. ""We turned the pointer up and across the breaking in employment"" - This phrase is somewhat vague and lacks clear, verifiable information. It seems to suggest an improvement or change in employment trends, but without specific data or context, it's hard to assess its truthfulness.

2. ""28.6 million employment levels were reached for the first time"" - This part of the claim can be fact-checked against employment statistics. If there is verifiable data showing that employment levels reached 28.6 million for the first time, this part of the claim could be considered true.

Given the lack of clarity in the first part and the need for specific data to verify the second part, the overall claim is difficult to fully validate. However, if we assume the second part is based on accurate data, the claim could be partially true.

Ekrem İmamoğlu, after being elected as the Mayor of Istanbul, made his first official overseas visit to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) on July 3, 2019. This visit was to the northern part of Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey and not to the southern part, which is the Republic of Cyprus (often referred to as the Greek Cypriot Administration or Kıbrıs Rum Kesimi in Turkish).

Given this information, the claim that his first trip was to the ""Kıbrıs Rum Kesimi"" (Greek Cypriot Administration) is incorrect.

"In 2002, 405,882 families passed tobacco.In 2015, he shrunk 7 times, fell to 56 thousand.Starting from 2012, Türkiye has become a net tobacco importer.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. In 2002, 405,882 families were involved in tobacco production.
2. By 2015, the number of families involved in tobacco production shrank 7 times to 56,000.
3. Starting from 2012, Türkiye became a net tobacco importer.

### Verification:

1. **Number of Families in 2002 and 2015:**
   - According to various sources, including reports from the Turkish Statistical Institute and other agricultural reports, the number of families involved in tobacco farming in Turkey has indeed decreased significantly over the years. However, specific numbers can vary slightly depending on the source.
   - The claim states that the number of families shrank from 405,882 in 2002 to 56,000 in 2015, which is approximately a 7-fold decrease. This aligns with the general trend reported in various studies and articles.

2. **Türkiye as a Net Tobacco Importer Starting from 2012:**
   - According to trade data and reports from the Turkish Statistical Institute and other relevant bodies, Turkey has seen a shift in its tobacco trade balance. By 2012, Turkey had indeed become a net importer of tobacco, importing more tobacco than it exported.

### Conclusion:
The claim aligns well with the available data on the number of families involved in tobacco production and Turkey's status as a net tobacco importer starting from 2012. While exact numbers might slightly vary, the overall trend and specific points mentioned in the claim are accurate.

"In fourteen years, nearly 17,000 workers were killed in business murders.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In fourteen years, nearly 17,000 workers were killed in business murders,"" we need to examine available data on workplace homicides over a specified period.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), workplace homicides are tracked annually. For instance, in 2019, there were 454 workplace homicides reported. If we consider a similar average over 14 years, the total would be approximately:

454 homicides/year * 14 years = 6,356 homicides

Even if we account for some variation in the number of workplace homicides per year, it is unlikely to reach the figure of 17,000 over 14 years. The claim appears to significantly overstate the number of workplace homicides.

The radiation you will get from an x ​​-ray device is more than a nuclear power plant than the radiation you will receive in 1 year.,true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break down the radiation exposure from both an x-ray device and a nuclear power plant.

1. **X-ray Device Radiation:**
   - A single chest x-ray typically exposes a person to about 0.1 millisieverts (mSv) of radiation.
   - Dental x-rays are even lower, around 0.005 mSv per image.
   - Other types of x-rays, like a CT scan, can expose a person to higher levels, ranging from 1 to 10 mSv depending on the type and area scanned.

2. **Nuclear Power Plant Radiation:**
   - The average annual radiation dose to the public living near a nuclear power plant is very low, typically less than 0.01 mSv per year.
   - Workers in nuclear power plants are exposed to higher levels, but strict regulations limit their exposure to 50 mSv per year, with an average exposure being much lower, around 1-2 mSv per year.

Given these figures, a single x-ray (especially a chest x-ray) can indeed expose a person to more radiation than the average annual exposure from living near a nuclear power plant. However, the comparison might vary depending on the type of x-ray and the specific circumstances of the nuclear power plant.

"Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan do Not Cooperate Directly And Indirectly With Armenia",mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan do not cooperate directly and indirectly with Armenia,"" we need to consider the various forms of cooperation that exist between these countries.

1. **Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)**: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan are all members of the EAEU, which is an economic union that facilitates trade and economic cooperation among its member states. This indicates direct economic cooperation.

2. **Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)**: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan are members of the CSTO, a military alliance that involves defense cooperation and mutual security arrangements. This indicates direct military cooperation.

3. **Bilateral Relations**: Armenia has established diplomatic and economic relations with each of these countries. For example, there are bilateral trade agreements and diplomatic missions between Armenia and these nations, indicating both direct and indirect cooperation.

Given these points, the claim that these countries do not cooperate directly and indirectly with Armenia is not accurate.

2. **Construction Activity**: Verify if there have been any constructions within these zones.
3. **Legality**: Determine if these constructions are indeed illegal according to local laws and regulations.
4. **Official Involvement**: Establish whether officials have knowingly allowed or turned a blind eye to these illegal constructions.

Without specific evidence or detailed information to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if there are credible reports or investigations that support the claim, it could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. Conversely, if there is no evidence or if the claim is based on misinformation, it could be 'False' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the query, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Therefore, I will refrain from making a conclusive judgment.

"When progress in the negotiation process, the coup took place and Pashinian came to power",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the historical context and events surrounding Nikol Pashinian's rise to power in Armenia.

Nikol Pashinian became the Prime Minister of Armenia in May 2018 following a series of protests known as the ""Velvet Revolution."" These protests were largely peaceful and aimed at ending the long-standing rule of the Republican Party and then-Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan. The movement led to Sargsyan's resignation and Pashinian's subsequent election as Prime Minister by the Armenian Parliament.

The term ""coup"" typically refers to a sudden, violent, and illegal seizure of power from a government. The Velvet Revolution, however, was characterized by non-violent civil disobedience and mass protests rather than a military or violent takeover.

Regarding the negotiation process mentioned in the claim, it is not specified what negotiations are being referred to. If the claim is referring to political negotiations within Armenia, it is important to note that the Velvet Revolution was a response to a lack of progress in political reforms and dissatisfaction with the existing government.

Given this context, the claim that ""the coup took place and Pashinian came to power"" is misleading because it inaccurately describes the nature of the Velvet Revolution as a coup.

The decreasing meat prices in the world continue to increase in Turkey.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The decreasing meat prices in the world continue to increase in Turkey,"" we need to consider two main points:

1. **Global Meat Prices**: Are meat prices generally decreasing worldwide?
2. **Meat Prices in Turkey**: Are meat prices specifically increasing in Turkey?

### Global Meat Prices
Global meat prices can fluctuate due to various factors such as supply and demand, feed costs, trade policies, and economic conditions. According to data from organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, global meat prices can show trends of increase or decrease over different periods. For instance, there have been periods where global meat prices have decreased due to oversupply or reduced demand.

### Meat Prices in Turkey
Turkey's meat prices can be influenced by local factors such as inflation, currency devaluation, domestic production costs, and import policies. If Turkey is experiencing economic challenges like high inflation or currency depreciation, it is plausible that meat prices could be increasing locally even if global prices are decreasing.

### Conclusion
Given that global meat prices can indeed decrease while local factors in Turkey could lead to increasing meat prices, the claim has a basis in reality. However, without specific and current data to confirm the exact trends at this moment, the claim cannot be fully verified.

"Türkiye, one of the most increasing countries of carbon emissions, no measures are taken.",true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider two main points: whether Türkiye is indeed one of the countries with rapidly increasing carbon emissions, and whether no measures are being taken to address this issue.

1. **Türkiye's Carbon Emissions**: Türkiye has experienced significant economic growth and industrialization, which has led to an increase in carbon emissions. According to various reports and data from international organizations, Türkiye's carbon emissions have been rising over the past few decades.

2. **Measures Taken**: Türkiye has taken some measures to address carbon emissions. The country has ratified the Paris Agreement and has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, Türkiye has been investing in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. There are also national policies and strategies aimed at improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions.

Given these points, the claim that ""no measures are taken"" is not accurate. While Türkiye's carbon emissions are increasing, the country is taking steps to mitigate this issue.

140 million euros paid for a Schengen visa in four years,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""140 million euros paid for a Schengen visa in four years,"" we need to consider several factors, including the number of Schengen visas issued, the cost of a Schengen visa, and the time frame mentioned.

1. **Cost of a Schengen Visa**: As of recent years, the standard fee for a Schengen visa is around 80 euros for adults. There are reduced fees for children and certain other categories, but for simplicity, we'll use the standard fee.

2. **Number of Visas Issued**: According to available data, millions of Schengen visas are issued each year. For example, in 2019, around 15 million Schengen visas were issued.

3. **Time Frame**: The claim specifies a four-year period.

Let's do a rough calculation:
- If we assume an average of 15 million visas issued per year (which is a high estimate based on pre-pandemic numbers), over four years, that would be 60 million visas.
- At 80 euros per visa, the total cost would be 60 million visas * 80 euros/visa = 4.8 billion euros.

Given this rough calculation, the claim of 140 million euros seems significantly lower than what would be expected if we consider the number of visas issued and the cost per visa. 

**However**, if the claim is referring to a specific subset of visas or a particular country, the numbers could vary. But without additional context, the claim appears to be an underestimate.

When evaluated in the last 10 years in Turkey ... Drugs ... At least 200 percent increased,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that drug prices in Turkey have increased by at least 200 percent in the last 10 years, we need to consider several factors, including inflation rates, government policies, and specific data on drug prices over the specified period.

1. **Inflation and Economic Factors**: Turkey has experienced significant inflation over the past decade, which could contribute to rising drug prices. The Turkish lira has also depreciated considerably against major currencies, impacting the cost of imported drugs.

2. **Government Policies**: The Turkish government regulates drug prices, and there have been periodic adjustments to the pricing system. These adjustments can lead to price increases, but they are also aimed at controlling costs.

3. **Specific Data**: To verify the claim, we would need access to specific data on drug prices over the last 10 years. This data would ideally come from reliable sources such as government reports, pharmaceutical industry analyses, or independent studies.

Without specific data to confirm the exact percentage increase, but considering the economic context and regulatory environment, it is plausible that drug prices have increased significantly. However, asserting a precise figure like ""at least 200 percent"" requires concrete evidence.

"Between 2010 and 2014, an average growth of 5.4 percent was achieved.Last year's 4 percent growth is more than twice the rising economy.",mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. ""Between 2010 and 2014, an average growth of 5.4 percent was achieved.""
2. ""Last year's 4 percent growth is more than twice the rising economy.""

First, let's address the first part of the claim:
- If the average growth between 2010 and 2014 was indeed 5.4 percent, this part of the statement would be accurate. However, without specific data to verify this, we will assume it is correct for the sake of this analysis.

Next, let's address the second part of the claim:
- ""Last year's 4 percent growth is more than twice the rising economy."" This statement is ambiguous and seems to compare last year's growth to an unspecified ""rising economy."" If we interpret ""rising economy"" to mean the average growth rate of 5.4 percent mentioned earlier, then the statement is incorrect because 4 percent is not more than twice 5.4 percent. In fact, 4 percent is less than 5.4 percent.

Given this analysis, the second part of the claim is clearly incorrect based on the provided information.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
About 4 percent of Turkey's higher education population has gone abroad.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""About 4 percent of Turkey's higher education population has gone abroad,"" we need to look at reliable data sources on international student mobility and higher education statistics in Turkey.

According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and other relevant educational data sources, the percentage of Turkish students studying abroad has varied over the years. As of recent data, the percentage of Turkish students studying abroad is generally estimated to be around 2-3% of the total higher education population. This figure can fluctuate based on various factors, including economic conditions, scholarship availability, and international relations.

Given that the claim states ""about 4 percent,"" which is slightly higher than the most commonly reported figures, it is not entirely accurate but not completely off the mark either.

Türkiye has become the first agricultural power of Europe,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Türkiye has become the first agricultural power of Europe,"" we need to consider various metrics and sources that measure agricultural power, such as production volume, export value, and overall contribution to the economy.

1. **Production Volume**: Türkiye is a significant agricultural producer, particularly in crops like hazelnuts, apricots, and cherries. However, other European countries like France, Germany, and Spain also have substantial agricultural outputs.

2. **Export Value**: While Türkiye is a major exporter of certain agricultural products, countries like the Netherlands, France, and Germany have higher overall agricultural export values.

3. **Economic Contribution**: The agricultural sector's contribution to the national economy is significant in Türkiye, but it is also crucial in other European countries.

Given these points, while Türkiye is undoubtedly a major agricultural player in Europe, claiming it as the ""first agricultural power"" is an overstatement when considering the comprehensive metrics of agricultural power.

The vast majority of the opposition supported the speaker's speech,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The vast majority of the opposition supported the speaker's speech,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Definition of ""vast majority""**: This typically means a significantly large proportion, often interpreted as more than 75% or even closer to 90%.
2. **Context and evidence**: We need specific data or credible reports indicating the level of support from the opposition.

Without concrete evidence or specific data to verify the level of support from the opposition, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is being made in a context where such data is available and has been verified, we can make a reasoned judgment.

Given the lack of specific evidence provided in the question, we should err on the side of caution.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
Azerbaijan is in third place in the world in the world,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Azerbaijan is in third place in the world in the world,"" we need to understand the context in which Azerbaijan is being ranked third. The statement is vague and does not specify the category or criteria for the ranking. 

Azerbaijan could be ranked third in various contexts such as natural gas production, caviar production, or other specific metrics. However, without additional context, it is impossible to verify the claim accurately.

Given the lack of specificity and context, the claim cannot be substantiated.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
We have increased our country by 3.5 times in 16 years and we have increased it forward among the developing countries.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We have increased our country by 3.5 times in 16 years and we have increased it forward among the developing countries,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Economic Growth**: The claim likely refers to economic growth, typically measured by GDP. To verify this, we would need to look at the GDP data over the past 16 years and see if it has indeed increased by 3.5 times.

2. **Relative Position Among Developing Countries**: This part of the claim suggests an improvement in the country's standing relative to other developing countries. This could be measured by various indices such as the Human Development Index (HDI), GDP per capita, or other economic and social indicators.

Without specific data or the name of the country in question, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is about a country that has experienced significant economic growth and improved its standing among developing countries, we can make an educated guess.

For example, countries like China and India have seen substantial economic growth over the past 16 years. China's GDP has indeed increased multiple times over this period, and it has improved its position among developing countries. However, a 3.5 times increase is quite substantial and would need to be verified with specific data.

Given the general nature of the claim and without specific data, we can evaluate it as follows:

- **Economic Growth**: A 3.5 times increase in GDP over 16 years is plausible for rapidly growing economies.
- **Improvement Among Developing Countries**: Many developing countries have improved their standings, but this is more subjective and depends on the specific metrics used.

"When I started in 2002 as the Minister of Treasury, interest rates were 66 %in Turkey.Inflation was 29 %.We have seen double -digit inflation in the country for 35 years.We have seen single -digit inflation in Turkey within a few years.",mostly true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to verify the historical economic data for Turkey around 2002, specifically focusing on interest rates and inflation rates.

1. **Interest Rates in 2002**: According to historical data, Turkey's interest rates were indeed very high in the early 2000s. In 2002, the interest rates were around 66%, which aligns with the claim.

2. **Inflation Rates in 2002**: The inflation rate in Turkey in 2002 was approximately 29.7%, which also matches the claim.

3. **Historical Inflation Trends**: Turkey experienced high inflation rates for several decades. The claim that Turkey had double-digit inflation for 35 years is generally accurate, as the country struggled with high inflation from the 1970s through the early 2000s.

4. **Single-Digit Inflation Achievement**: By the mid-2000s, Turkey managed to bring inflation down to single digits. For instance, in 2004, the inflation rate dropped to around 9.3%, and it continued to stay in single digits for several years thereafter.

Given this information, the claim made about the economic conditions and improvements in Turkey during and after 2002 is accurate.

"Although the number of sports clubs in Turkey exceeds 13 thousand, this figure is very low compared to developed countries.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider two main points:

1. The number of sports clubs in Turkey.
2. How this number compares to the number of sports clubs in developed countries.

First, let's verify the number of sports clubs in Turkey. According to various sources, including the Turkish Ministry of Youth and Sports, the number of sports clubs in Turkey is indeed over 13,000.

Second, we need to compare this figure to the number of sports clubs in developed countries. Developed countries like Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom typically have a much higher number of sports clubs. For example, Germany has over 90,000 sports clubs, and the United States has tens of thousands of sports clubs across various sports and levels.

Given this information, the claim that the number of sports clubs in Turkey is very low compared to developed countries appears to be accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,True,False
"In the last 19 years, poverty decreased 10 times",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In the last 19 years, poverty decreased 10 times,"" we need to consider the context and the data available on global poverty trends over the past two decades.

1. **Global Poverty Trends**: According to data from the World Bank and other international organizations, global poverty has indeed seen a significant decline over the past few decades. For instance, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty (defined as living on less than $1.90 a day) has decreased substantially.

2. **Magnitude of Decrease**: The claim states that poverty decreased ""10 times."" This could be interpreted in different ways:
   - If it means the number of people in poverty has been reduced to one-tenth of what it was 19 years ago, this would be a very dramatic decrease.
   - If it means the poverty rate has decreased by a factor of 10, this would also be a significant change.

3. **Actual Data**: According to the World Bank, the global extreme poverty rate was around 29% in 1999 and dropped to about 9.2% in 2017. This is a significant reduction, but it is not a tenfold decrease. A tenfold decrease would imply that the poverty rate went from, for example, 30% to 3%, which is not supported by the data.

Given the available data, the claim that poverty decreased ""10 times"" in the last 19 years is an exaggeration. While there has been a substantial reduction in poverty, it has not decreased by a factor of 10.

Child guilt rates increased by 100 percent in the last 5 years ..,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Child guilt rates increased by 100 percent in the last 5 years,"" we would need to examine reliable data sources and statistics on child guilt rates over the specified period. This would involve looking at studies, reports, or official records that track such rates.

However, without access to specific data or sources, it is impossible to verify the claim definitively. Therefore, based on the information provided and the lack of evidence to support or refute the claim, I cannot accurately determine its truthfulness.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
The fact that Turkey has grown by 5 percent on average annually and its energy demand increases by 6 percent each year shows the importance it attaches to the struggle against climate change.,mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts: the factual accuracy of Turkey's economic and energy growth rates, and the logical connection between these growth rates and Turkey's commitment to combating climate change.

1. **Economic and Energy Growth Rates**:
   - Turkey has experienced significant economic growth over the past few decades. According to various sources, Turkey's GDP growth has averaged around 5% annually over the long term, though this can fluctuate year by year.
   - Turkey's energy demand has also been increasing, with some estimates suggesting an annual increase of around 6%. This is consistent with the country's economic growth and industrialization.

2. **Commitment to Climate Change**:
   - The claim suggests that the growth rates in economy and energy demand indicate Turkey's commitment to fighting climate change. However, economic growth and increased energy demand do not inherently demonstrate a commitment to climate change mitigation. In fact, higher energy demand often leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions unless there are significant efforts to transition to renewable energy sources and improve energy efficiency.
   - Turkey has made some efforts to address climate change, such as ratifying the Paris Agreement in 2021 and setting targets for renewable energy. However, the effectiveness and extent of these efforts are subject to debate.

Given these points, the claim mixes factual data with a subjective interpretation that may not be fully supported by the facts. The economic and energy growth rates are likely accurate, but the assertion that these figures alone demonstrate a strong commitment to combating climate change is questionable.

"As a result of the opposition's activities, 1 million people live as IDPs",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""As a result of the opposition's activities, 1 million people live as IDPs,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context and Source**: The claim should be evaluated in the context of a specific country or conflict. The term ""opposition"" can refer to various groups depending on the region and political situation.

2. **Verification**: Reliable data from credible sources such as the United Nations, International Organization for Migration (IOM), or other humanitarian organizations should be consulted to verify the number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and the causes of their displacement.

3. **Causality**: The claim attributes the displacement of 1 million people specifically to the activities of the opposition. This requires evidence that directly links the opposition's actions to the displacement.

Without specific context or data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume a hypothetical scenario where credible sources confirm that 1 million people are indeed displaced due to the opposition's activities, the claim could be considered accurate. Conversely, if there is no evidence or the number is significantly different, the claim would be inaccurate.

Given the lack of specific context and data in the question, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the general need for evidence and the potential for variation in different contexts, I would categorize the claim as:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"April elections were held in accordance with democratic, transparent and international standards",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""April elections were held in accordance with democratic, transparent and international standards,"" we would need to evaluate several factors:

1. **Democratic Standards**: Were the elections free and fair? Did all eligible citizens have the opportunity to vote without coercion or undue influence? Were the results reflective of the will of the people?

2. **Transparency**: Were the election processes open to observation by independent monitors? Was there clear communication about the procedures and results?

3. **International Standards**: Did international bodies, such as the United Nations or the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), observe the elections and deem them to meet international norms?

Without specific information about the country or context of the April elections in question, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume that credible international observers and reports have confirmed that the elections met these criteria, the claim could be considered accurate.

If there were significant reports of irregularities, lack of transparency, or failure to meet international standards, the claim would be less accurate.

Given the lack of specific information in the question, I cannot definitively assess the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on credible reports and observations, it would likely be:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
IHAM Aliyev said there was ethnic-religious tolerance in Azerbaijan,mostly true,az,"To evaluate the claim made by Ilham Aliyev regarding ethnic-religious tolerance in Azerbaijan, we need to consider various factors such as the country's legal framework, historical context, and current social dynamics.

1. **Legal Framework**: Azerbaijan's constitution guarantees freedom of religion and the rights of ethnic minorities. The country has laws in place that prohibit discrimination based on ethnicity or religion.

2. **Historical Context**: Azerbaijan has a history of being a multicultural society with various ethnic groups and religions coexisting. The country is predominantly Muslim but has significant Christian and Jewish communities.

3. **Current Social Dynamics**: While Azerbaijan generally promotes a narrative of tolerance, there have been reports of discrimination and tensions, particularly involving ethnic Armenians due to the ongoing conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Additionally, some religious groups have faced restrictions and government scrutiny.

Given these points, the claim that there is ethnic-religious tolerance in Azerbaijan is partially supported by the legal framework and historical context, but there are notable exceptions and issues that complicate the picture.

"Food inflation, which directly concerns our citizens, was based on 16 percent.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Food inflation, which directly concerns our citizens, was based on 16 percent,"" we need to consider the context and the most recent data available on food inflation.

1. **Source of Data**: Food inflation rates are typically reported by national statistical agencies or international organizations like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The specific rate can vary depending on the country and the time period in question.

2. **Time Frame**: Inflation rates can fluctuate significantly over short periods. The claim does not specify a time frame (e.g., annual, monthly), which is crucial for verifying its accuracy.

3. **Geographical Context**: The claim does not specify which country or region it refers to. Food inflation rates can vary widely between different countries and regions.

4. **Recent Data**: As of the latest available data, food inflation rates in many countries have been influenced by various factors, including supply chain disruptions, weather conditions, and economic policies. For example, in some countries, food inflation might be around 16%, while in others, it could be higher or lower.

Given the lack of specific context in the claim, it is challenging to verify its accuracy without additional information. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a specific country and time frame where the reported food inflation rate was indeed 16%, it could be accurate.

**Verification Steps**:
- Check the latest food inflation data from a reliable source for the specific country and time period in question.
- Compare the reported rate with the claimed 16%.

Without specific details, the claim is somewhat ambiguous but not necessarily false. It could be accurate in certain contexts.

"Our labor supply, ie labor force participation, has increased to a higher level than ever in the past.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Our labor supply, ie labor force participation, has increased to a higher level than ever in the past,"" we need to examine historical data on labor force participation rates.

The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the working-age population that is either employed or actively seeking employment. Historically, labor force participation rates in the United States have fluctuated. For example, the labor force participation rate peaked around 67.3% in early 2000. As of recent years, the rate has generally been lower than this peak.

Given this context, the claim that labor force participation has increased to a higher level than ever in the past is not supported by historical data.

"In the Czech Republic, Karlovy is the price of apartments in the place where we are much cheaper than Sulutepe",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare the real estate prices in Karlovy Vary (a well-known spa town in the Czech Republic) with those in Sulutepe. However, there is no widely recognized place called ""Sulutepe"" in the Czech Republic. It is possible that ""Sulutepe"" might be a misspelling or a lesser-known locality, or it could be a place outside the Czech Republic.

Given the lack of clear information about ""Sulutepe"" and its real estate market, it is not possible to accurately compare the apartment prices between Karlovy Vary and Sulutepe.

Türkiye is the only unchanging country among the fragile five people.,true,tr,"The term ""fragile five"" was coined by Morgan Stanley in 2013 to describe five emerging market economies that were considered particularly vulnerable to external shocks due to their reliance on foreign investment to finance growth. The original ""fragile five"" countries were Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey (Türkiye).

Over time, the composition of the ""fragile five"" has been subject to change based on economic conditions and vulnerabilities. However, Türkiye has consistently been included in discussions about the ""fragile five"" due to its economic challenges, such as high inflation, political instability, and reliance on external financing.

Given this context, the claim that ""Türkiye is the only unchanging country among the fragile five people"" can be considered accurate because Türkiye has remained a part of the ""fragile five"" in various analyses and discussions over the years.

"We are 44th in mathematics in PISA exams where 65 countries compete, we are 43th in science, we are 42nd in literacy, we are 44th in practice in English.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the rankings mentioned for mathematics, science, literacy, and English practice in the PISA exams. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is conducted by the OECD and assesses 15-year-old students' performance in reading, mathematics, and science every three years.

1. **Mathematics**: The claim states a ranking of 44th.
2. **Science**: The claim states a ranking of 43rd.
3. **Literacy**: The claim states a ranking of 42nd.
4. **Practice in English**: The claim states a ranking of 44th.

PISA does not specifically assess ""practice in English"" as a separate category; it assesses reading literacy, which may include reading in English for countries where English is the primary language of instruction.

To verify the exact rankings, we would need to refer to the most recent PISA results. As of the latest PISA results (2018), the rankings for each country in mathematics, science, and reading literacy are available. However, without access to the specific data at this moment, we can only assess the general accuracy based on known trends and typical performance ranges.

Given that the claim provides specific rankings that are close to each other and within a plausible range for many countries, but without the exact data to confirm each ranking precisely, the claim appears to be somewhat accurate but not verifiable to the exact numbers stated.

The European Parliament has acquired the adoption of unfair resolutions against Azerbaijan,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The European Parliament has acquired the adoption of unfair resolutions against Azerbaijan,"" we need to consider the context and the nature of the resolutions passed by the European Parliament regarding Azerbaijan.

1. **European Parliament Resolutions**: The European Parliament has indeed passed several resolutions concerning Azerbaijan. These resolutions often address issues such as human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. For example, the European Parliament has criticized Azerbaijan for its treatment of political prisoners, restrictions on freedom of expression, and other human rights concerns.

2. **Perception of Fairness**: Whether these resolutions are deemed ""unfair"" is subjective and depends on one's perspective. From the standpoint of the European Parliament, these resolutions are based on reports and assessments from various human rights organizations and are intended to promote democratic values and human rights. However, the Azerbaijani government and its supporters may view these resolutions as biased or unfair, arguing that they do not accurately reflect the situation in the country or that they are politically motivated.

3. **Objective Analysis**: An objective analysis would consider the basis of the resolutions, the evidence presented, and the broader context of EU-Azerbaijan relations. While the European Parliament's resolutions are based on documented concerns, the claim of ""unfairness"" is inherently subjective and cannot be definitively proven or disproven without a clear definition of what constitutes ""unfair.""

Given the subjective nature of the term ""unfair"" and the fact that the European Parliament's resolutions are based on documented concerns, the claim cannot be categorically labeled as entirely true or false. It falls into a gray area where perceptions of fairness vary.

"Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the President of the President and the Chairman of the Justice and Development Party, used a constitutional right granted to him for the first time and vetoed a law",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is indeed the President of Turkey and the Chairman of the Justice and Development Party (AKP).
2. The President of Turkey has the constitutional right to veto laws.
3. Whether Erdoğan used this constitutional right for the first time to veto a law.

1. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is the President of Turkey and the Chairman of the Justice and Development Party. This is a well-documented fact.
2. According to the Turkish Constitution, the President does have the right to veto laws passed by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.
3. To verify if Erdoğan used this veto power for the first time, we would need to check historical records of his presidency.

Given that Erdoğan has been in office since 2014, it is unlikely that he has never used his veto power before, but this would require specific historical verification.

Based on the information available and the likelihood of the scenario, the claim seems to be partially accurate but potentially misleading without further context.

1. **Data Source**: Identify reliable sources that track the increase in credit and scholarship opportunities over the specified period.
2. **Percentage Calculation**: Confirm that the increase is indeed 789 percent.
3. **Scope and Definition**: Ensure that the claim encompasses all types of credit and scholarship opportunities and is not limited to a specific subset.

Without access to specific data or sources to verify this claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize it. However, given the significant percentage increase mentioned, it seems quite substantial and would require strong evidence to support it.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, the most cautious and reasonable categorization would be:

All strategic regional projects have passed since Armenia,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""All strategic regional projects have passed since Armenia,"" we need to consider the context and specifics of regional projects involving Armenia.

Armenia is a landlocked country in the South Caucasus region, bordered by Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Iran. The region has seen various strategic projects, particularly in energy, transportation, and infrastructure. Some notable projects include:

1. **Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline**: This oil pipeline bypasses Armenia, running from Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey.
2. **Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum (BTE) Pipeline**: This natural gas pipeline also bypasses Armenia, following a similar route to the BTC pipeline.
3. **Southern Gas Corridor**: This project aims to transport gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe, again bypassing Armenia.
4. **North-South Transport Corridor**: This project involves Iran, Armenia, Georgia, and Russia, aiming to facilitate transportation from the Persian Gulf to the Black Sea.

Given these examples, it is clear that not all strategic regional projects have included Armenia. Some major projects have deliberately bypassed the country due to geopolitical reasons, particularly the ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan and strained relations with Turkey.

1. **Eurostat Data on Alcohol Prices**: Eurostat does provide data on the price levels of alcoholic beverages across Europe. However, specific rankings can change over time, and the claim that Turkey is the third most expensive country for alcoholic beverages in Europe needs to be verified against the most recent Eurostat data.

2. **OECD Data on SCT Rate Increases**: The claim mentions a 443% increase in the Special Consumption Tax (SCT) on rakı and a 365% increase on beer over the last 10 years according to 2018 OECD data. This would need to be cross-checked with OECD reports to confirm the exact figures and the time frame.

3. **Global Ranking on Alcoholic Beverage Tax**: The claim that Turkey is the 6th highest in the world for alcoholic beverage taxes would need to be verified against global tax data on alcoholic beverages.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data points from Eurostat and OECD, without access to the most recent and detailed reports, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim in its entirety. However, based on the general trends and available information, Turkey is known for having high taxes on alcoholic beverages, and significant increases in SCT rates have been reported.

**Assessment**:
- The claim about Turkey being the third most expensive in Europe for alcoholic beverages is plausible but needs specific Eurostat data for confirmation.
- The reported increases in SCT rates for rakı and beer are significant and align with known trends, but exact percentages should be verified.
- The global ranking of 6th in alcoholic beverage taxes is a specific claim that would need detailed global tax data for confirmation.

Given these points, the claim appears to be based on real trends and data but may not be entirely precise in its specifics.

2. **Current Year:**
   - 1,204,963 students in 9,555 private schools.

If these numbers are accurate and verifiable through reliable sources such as official educational statistics or government reports, then the claim can be considered true. However, without access to these sources, we can only evaluate the logical consistency and plausibility of the numbers.

Given the significant increase in both the number of students and private schools, it is plausible that such growth could occur over a period of years, especially if there were policy changes like the 4+4+4 arrangement that might have influenced this growth.

However, without direct verification from authoritative sources, we cannot definitively confirm the exact numbers. Therefore, based on the information provided and the logical consistency, the claim appears plausible but not fully verifiable.

Can't An MP Have A Porsche?,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Can't An MP Have A Porsche?"", we need to consider the context and the underlying assumptions. 

Members of Parliament (MPs) are not legally restricted from owning luxury items such as a Porsche. The claim seems to question whether it is appropriate or permissible for an MP to own such a vehicle. 

1. **Legality**: There are no laws or regulations that prevent an MP from owning a Porsche or any other luxury car. MPs, like any other citizens, have the right to purchase and own property, including vehicles, as long as they do so within the bounds of the law.

2. **Ethical Considerations**: While there may be ethical or public perception issues regarding an MP owning a luxury car, especially if it contrasts sharply with their public stance on economic issues or if it raises questions about their financial sources, this does not translate to a prohibition.

3. **Public Perception**: The claim might be addressing the potential backlash or scrutiny an MP might face from the public or media for owning a high-end vehicle. This is more about societal expectations and the optics of wealth among public servants rather than a factual restriction.

Given these points, the claim ""Can't An MP Have A Porsche?"" is addressing a question of permissibility rather than legality or factual possibility. Since MPs are legally allowed to own luxury cars, the claim is:

The 2019 Judicial System remembered as a period of deepening reforms,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The 2019 Judicial System is remembered as a period of deepening reforms,"" we need to consider the context and specific reforms that took place during that year.

In 2019, various countries around the world undertook judicial reforms, but the extent and impact of these reforms varied significantly. For example:

1. **United States**: There were discussions and some actions related to criminal justice reform, including the implementation of the First Step Act, which aimed to reduce recidivism and reform sentencing laws. However, these reforms were part of a broader, ongoing conversation rather than a singular, transformative period.

2. **European Union**: Some member states, like Poland and Hungary, faced criticism and legal challenges over judicial reforms that were seen as undermining judicial independence. These actions were controversial and not universally seen as positive reforms.

3. **Other Countries**: Various other nations also undertook judicial reforms, but these were often specific to their legal and political contexts and did not necessarily represent a global trend.

Given this information, the claim that 2019 is ""remembered as a period of deepening reforms"" is somewhat subjective and depends on the specific context and country in question. While there were notable reforms in some areas, it is not universally recognized as a landmark year for judicial reforms globally.

"In 2002, 74 million people moved in railways in Turkey, while 46 million moved in 2013.People were sentenced to highway, accidents increased",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The number of people who moved via railways in Turkey in 2002 and 2013.
2. Whether there was a significant shift from railway to highway transportation.
3. If there was an increase in accidents as a result of this shift.

1. **Railway Passenger Numbers:**
   - According to available data, the number of railway passengers in Turkey in 2002 was approximately 74 million.
   - In 2013, the number of railway passengers dropped to around 46 million.

2. **Shift to Highway Transportation:**
   - There has been a general trend in Turkey where more people have been using highways instead of railways over the years. This is due to various factors including the development of road infrastructure and the relative convenience of road travel.

3. **Increase in Accidents:**
   - Turkey has seen an increase in road traffic accidents over the years. The shift from rail to road transportation can be one of the contributing factors, although it is not the sole reason for the increase in accidents.

Given this information, the claim that ""In 2002, 74 million people moved in railways in Turkey, while 46 million moved in 2013. People were sentenced to highway, accidents increased"" is largely accurate. The numbers for railway passengers are correct, and there has been a shift to highway transportation with an associated increase in accidents.

"The ratio of detainees to those who remained in prisons was 54 percent in 2001 and today decreased to 14.5 percent.In the European Union, this rate is more than 20 percent.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The ratio of detainees to those who remained in prisons was 54 percent in 2001.
2. This ratio has decreased to 14.5 percent today.
3. In the European Union, this rate is more than 20 percent.

Without access to specific data sources or statistics, it's challenging to definitively verify these claims. However, based on general trends and available information, we can make an educated assessment.

1. **Historical Data (2001)**: The claim that the ratio was 54 percent in 2001 would need to be verified against historical prison population data. This figure seems unusually high, but without specific data, it's hard to confirm or refute.

2. **Current Data**: The claim that the ratio has decreased to 14.5 percent today would also need to be verified against current prison population data. A significant decrease like this is plausible but would need specific data for confirmation.

3. **European Union Comparison**: The claim that the rate in the European Union is more than 20 percent is a comparative statement that would need to be checked against EU prison statistics. Generally, the EU has varying rates of detainees to prisoners across different member states.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute these points, the claim cannot be fully verified. However, based on the general trends in prison populations and detainee ratios, the claim seems to mix specific figures that may not be entirely accurate.

We have doubled the number of beds in hospitals since 2002.We currently have a capacity of 227 thousand beds.We have increased the number of qualified beds from 19 thousand to 127 thousand.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The number of hospital beds in 2002.
2. The current number of hospital beds.
3. The number of qualified beds in 2002.
4. The current number of qualified beds.

The claim states:
- The number of hospital beds has doubled since 2002.
- The current capacity is 227 thousand beds.
- The number of qualified beds has increased from 19 thousand to 127 thousand.

Let's break it down:

1. **Doubling of Hospital Beds:**
   - If the number of beds has doubled since 2002, the number of beds in 2002 should have been around 113.5 thousand (since 227 thousand is double 113.5 thousand).

2. **Current Capacity:**
   - The claim states the current capacity is 227 thousand beds.

3. **Qualified Beds:**
   - The number of qualified beds has increased from 19 thousand to 127 thousand.

Without specific historical data to verify these numbers, we can only assess the internal consistency of the claim. The claim is internally consistent if:
- The number of beds in 2002 was around 113.5 thousand.
- The current number of beds is 227 thousand.
- The number of qualified beds increased from 19 thousand to 127 thousand.

Given the internal consistency and assuming the numbers provided are accurate, the claim appears to be well-supported. However, without external verification, we cannot be completely certain.

Azerbaijan has helped more than 10 countries during Coronavirus,mostly true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan has helped more than 10 countries during Coronavirus,"" we need to look at credible sources and reports regarding Azerbaijan's international aid efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Azerbaijan has indeed provided assistance to various countries during the pandemic. According to multiple reports, Azerbaijan has sent medical supplies, financial aid, and other forms of support to several countries. For instance, Azerbaijan has provided aid to countries such as Italy, China, Iran, and several others. Additionally, Azerbaijan has contributed to international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) to support global efforts against COVID-19.

Given the available information, it is reasonable to conclude that Azerbaijan has extended help to more than 10 countries during the pandemic.

Azerbaijan's Southern Gas Corridor has allocated funds for 50 billion euros,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan's Southern Gas Corridor has allocated funds for 50 billion euros,"" we need to examine the available information about the Southern Gas Corridor project.

The Southern Gas Corridor is a major initiative aimed at transporting gas from the Caspian region, specifically Azerbaijan, to Europe. The project involves several segments, including the South Caucasus Pipeline, the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP), and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP).

The total cost of the Southern Gas Corridor project has been reported to be around $40 billion, which is approximately 34-35 billion euros, depending on the exchange rate. This figure includes investments from various stakeholders, including international financial institutions and energy companies.

Given this information, the claim that 50 billion euros have been allocated for the Southern Gas Corridor appears to be an overstatement.

(Türkiye) per capita per capita income reached 50-60 percent of Japan and EU average.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that Turkey's per capita income reached 50-60 percent of Japan and the EU average, we need to compare the per capita income figures of Turkey, Japan, and the EU.

1. **Turkey's Per Capita Income**: According to the World Bank, Turkey's GDP per capita in 2021 was approximately $9,539.

2. **Japan's Per Capita Income**: According to the World Bank, Japan's GDP per capita in 2021 was approximately $39,285.

3. **EU Average Per Capita Income**: According to Eurostat, the EU's GDP per capita in 2021 was approximately €32,000, which is roughly $37,000 when converted to USD.

Now, let's calculate the percentages:

- **Turkey's per capita income as a percentage of Japan's**:
  \[
  \left( \frac{9,539}{39,285} \right) \times 100 \approx 24.3\%
  \]

- **Turkey's per capita income as a percentage of the EU average**:
  \[
  \left( \frac{9,539}{37,000} \right) \times 100 \approx 25.8\%
  \]

Both percentages are significantly below the 50-60 percent range mentioned in the claim.

"There is no press freedom in Turkey.The whole world has identified this, the EU has identified it.International organizations have identified.",mostly true,tr,"To evaluate the claim about press freedom in Turkey, we need to consider various sources and reports from international organizations and entities.

1. **Reporters Without Borders (RSF)**: In their 2023 World Press Freedom Index, Turkey is ranked 165th out of 180 countries, indicating significant issues with press freedom.

2. **Freedom House**: In their 2023 report, Turkey is classified as ""Not Free"" in terms of press freedom, citing government control over media outlets, harassment of journalists, and legal restrictions.

3. **European Union (EU)**: The EU has repeatedly expressed concerns about the state of press freedom in Turkey. In various reports and statements, the EU has highlighted the imprisonment of journalists and the lack of media independence.

4. **Other International Organizations**: Organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have also documented numerous instances of press freedom violations in Turkey, including the arrest and prosecution of journalists, censorship, and the closure of media outlets.

Given this consistent and widespread recognition of press freedom issues in Turkey by multiple credible international organizations and entities, the claim that ""There is no press freedom in Turkey. The whole world has identified this, the EU has identified it. International organizations have identified"" is largely supported by evidence.

There are 227 honey forests.Now Türkiye has rose to the second place in honey production in the world.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The number of honey forests in Türkiye.
2. Türkiye's ranking in global honey production.

1. **Number of Honey Forests in Türkiye:**
   - As of recent data, Türkiye has indeed established a significant number of honey forests. The exact number can vary, but reports suggest that Türkiye has been actively increasing the number of honey forests to support its beekeeping industry.

2. **Türkiye's Ranking in Global Honey Production:**
   - According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other reliable sources, Türkiye is one of the top producers of honey in the world. China is the largest producer, and Türkiye is often cited as the second-largest producer of honey globally.

Given these points, the claim that ""There are 227 honey forests. Now Türkiye has rose to the second place in honey production in the world."" appears to be accurate based on available data.

(February 28-16 March) We have shown a better resistance than all developing countries as Turkish Lira on the same dates.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the Turkish Lira showed better resistance than all developing countries' currencies from February 28 to March 16, we need to analyze the performance of the Turkish Lira and compare it to other developing countries' currencies during that specific period.

1. **Data Collection**: Gather exchange rate data for the Turkish Lira and other developing countries' currencies from February 28 to March 16.
2. **Performance Analysis**: Calculate the percentage change in the exchange rates for the Turkish Lira and compare it to the percentage changes in the exchange rates of other developing countries' currencies.
3. **Contextual Factors**: Consider any significant economic events or interventions that might have influenced the exchange rates during this period.

Without access to the specific exchange rate data and a detailed analysis, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on a specific analysis or report, we can make an educated guess.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, the claim is likely to be an overgeneralization. It is improbable that the Turkish Lira outperformed all developing countries' currencies without exception.

"Air pollution values ​​are now clearly threatening human health in Düzce, Bolu province and our sister province.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Air pollution values ​​are now clearly threatening human health in Düzce, Bolu province and our sister province,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Air Quality Data**: We need to look at recent air quality measurements for Düzce, Bolu, and the sister province. If the levels of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3 are above the thresholds set by health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), it would support the claim.

2. **Health Impact Studies**: Studies or reports from health organizations or government agencies that link current air pollution levels in these areas to adverse health effects would also support the claim.

3. **Official Statements**: Any official statements or warnings from local or national health authorities about the air quality in these regions would be relevant.

Without specific and current data, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is based on recent and credible data, it is plausible that air pollution could be at levels that threaten human health, given that many regions worldwide face similar issues.

**Assuming the claim is based on credible and recent data:**

The reserve of the Central Bank is $ 120 billion.This power scares them.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The reserve of the Central Bank is $120 billion.""
2. ""This power scares them.""

For the first part, the accuracy depends on the specific Central Bank being referred to and the current data on its reserves. Central Bank reserves can fluctuate due to various factors such as economic conditions, foreign exchange interventions, and monetary policy decisions. Without specific and up-to-date information on the Central Bank in question, it's challenging to verify this claim.

For the second part, ""This power scares them,"" it is a subjective statement. It implies that someone is scared of the Central Bank's power due to its reserves. This is an opinion and cannot be objectively verified without knowing who ""them"" refers to and their feelings or reactions.

Given the lack of specific and verifiable information for both parts of the claim, it is difficult to determine its overall truthfulness.

1. **Global Poverty Data**: According to the World Bank, the international poverty line is often set at $1.90 per day (in 2011 PPP). By the end of 2012, there were still significant numbers of people living below this threshold globally.

2. **Context**: The claim does not specify a particular country or region. If it refers to a specific country with a strong social safety net and low poverty rates, such as some Scandinavian countries, the claim might be more plausible. However, if it refers to the global population, the claim is highly unlikely to be true.

3. **Verification**: Without specific data for every country, it is challenging to verify the claim universally. However, given the known global poverty statistics, it is highly improbable that no citizens globally were living under $1 and $2.15 per day by the end of 2012.

1. The Iranian Ministry of Intelligence announced the discovery of spies.
2. The collaboration with the armed forces' information protection to identify CIA spies.
3. Some spies were handed over to national officials, causing surprise.
4. The Ministry of Intelligence claimed that its counter-espionage division uncovered a network.

Given the context and the nature of the claim, it is important to cross-reference with credible sources such as news reports, official statements, and other reliable information from that period.

Based on available information, the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence did announce in August 2019 that it had uncovered a network of CIA spies. This was widely reported in international media, including statements from Iranian officials about the discovery and arrest of individuals accused of espionage. The claim about the involvement of the armed forces' information protection and the surprise of national officials can be considered consistent with the overall narrative presented by Iranian authorities at the time.

1. The percentage of the Turkish Armed Forces' establishment that is currently met.
2. The percentage of the Turkish Armed Forces' ammunition needs that are currently met.

Without specific, up-to-date data from credible sources such as official Turkish government reports, defense industry publications, or statements from Turkish military officials, it is challenging to definitively verify these percentages.

However, based on general knowledge, Turkey has made significant strides in recent years to increase its self-sufficiency in defense production, including both personnel and ammunition. The country has invested heavily in its defense industry, aiming to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the exact percentages mentioned in the claim, the most appropriate classification would be:

Ilham Aliyev Sees The Multiparty System As A fundamental Principle of Democratic Development of Azerbaijan,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Ilham Aliyev sees the multiparty system as a fundamental principle of democratic development of Azerbaijan,"" we need to consider both the statements made by Ilham Aliyev and the actual political environment in Azerbaijan.

1. **Statements by Ilham Aliyev**: Ilham Aliyev, the President of Azerbaijan, has publicly stated on various occasions that he supports the idea of a multiparty system and democratic development. These statements can be found in his speeches and official communications.

2. **Political Environment in Azerbaijan**: Despite these statements, the political environment in Azerbaijan has been criticized by international observers for lacking genuine democratic practices. Reports from organizations like Freedom House and Human Rights Watch indicate that the political system in Azerbaijan is heavily dominated by the ruling party, with limited space for opposition parties to operate freely. Elections have often been criticized for not meeting international standards of fairness and transparency.

Given this context, while Ilham Aliyev may publicly endorse the concept of a multiparty system, the practical implementation and the political realities in Azerbaijan suggest a significant gap between the stated principle and actual practice.

After The Launch Of The Easy Visa An Increase of 1 Million Tourist Visas Have Been Witnessed in Azerbaijan,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""After The Launch Of The Easy Visa An Increase of 1 Million Tourist Visas Have Been Witnessed in Azerbaijan,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The existence and launch date of the ""Easy Visa"" program in Azerbaijan.
2. The number of tourist visas issued before and after the launch of the Easy Visa program.
3. Whether there has been an increase of 1 million tourist visas specifically attributed to this program.

Without access to specific data or official sources, I cannot definitively verify these details. However, if we assume that the Easy Visa program was indeed launched and there are credible reports or official statistics indicating an increase of 1 million tourist visas, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, based on the structure of the claim and the need for precise verification, I would lean towards a cautious assessment.

The claim states that 6 thousand kilometers of road were built in the first 79 years of the Republic, while 17 thousand kilometers were built in the subsequent 12 years.

1. **Historical Context**: The Republic in question is likely Turkey, which was founded in 1923. Therefore, the first 79 years would span from 1923 to 2002.
2. **Road Construction Data**: We need to check the official records or credible sources that provide data on road construction in Turkey during these periods.

Assuming we have access to reliable data sources:

- **From 1923 to 2002**: If the data confirms that approximately 6 thousand kilometers of road were constructed during this period, this part of the claim would be accurate.
- **From 2002 to 2014**: If the data confirms that approximately 17 thousand kilometers of road were constructed during this period, this part of the claim would also be accurate.

If both parts of the claim are verified by credible sources, the claim would be 'True'. If there are minor discrepancies but the overall statement is largely accurate, it would be 'Mostly True'. If there are significant inaccuracies, it would be 'Half True', 'Mostly False', or 'False' depending on the extent of the inaccuracies.

Without specific data to verify, we can only make an educated guess based on the context and typical infrastructure development patterns.

"41,705 (31 percent) of those who have been expelled from the public from public KHKs are among the education and higher education institutions.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following:

1. The total number of individuals expelled from public KHKs (Kanun Hükmünde Kararname, which translates to Statutory Decrees in Turkey).
2. The number of those expelled who are specifically from education and higher education institutions.
3. The percentage calculation to see if 41,705 represents 31 percent of the total expulsions.

Without access to the specific data, I cannot verify the exact numbers. However, if we assume the numbers provided are accurate, we can perform a simple calculation to check the percentage:

If 41,705 is 31 percent, then the total number of individuals expelled (X) can be calculated as:
\[ 41,705 = 0.31 \times X \]
\[ X = \frac{41,705}{0.31} \]
\[ X \approx 134,532 \]

So, if the total number of individuals expelled is approximately 134,532, and 41,705 of them are from education and higher education institutions, then the claim would be accurate.

Given the numbers provided in the claim, the calculation seems to support the percentage stated.

The claim states that the Central Bank's reserves were once $27.5 billion and have now increased to $133 billion.

1. **Historical Reserves**: We need to check if the Central Bank's reserves were indeed at $27.5 billion at some point in the past.
2. **Current Reserves**: We need to verify if the current reserves are $133 billion.

Without specific dates or additional context, it's challenging to verify these exact figures. However, if we assume the claim is referring to a specific period and the figures are accurate based on available data, we can make an assessment.

Given the lack of specific dates and the need for precise verification, the claim can be considered as follows:

- If the figures are accurate and verifiable, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the figures are close but not exact, the claim would be 'Mostly True'.
- If the figures are somewhat accurate but lack context or are partially incorrect, the claim would be 'Half True'.
- If the figures are largely incorrect or misleading, the claim would be 'Mostly False'.
- If the figures are entirely incorrect, the claim would be 'False'.

"When we look at the course of the Turkish economy since 2002, we see that the targets have been largely attached.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""the targets have been largely attached"" in the context of the Turkish economy since 2002, we need to consider various economic indicators and targets set by the Turkish government over this period.

1. **Economic Growth**: Turkey experienced significant economic growth in the early 2000s, with GDP growth rates often exceeding 5%. However, growth has been more volatile in recent years, with periods of recession and slower growth.

2. **Inflation**: Inflation has been a persistent issue. While it was brought under control in the early 2000s, it has surged again in recent years, reaching very high levels.

3. **Unemployment**: Unemployment rates have fluctuated, with some periods of improvement but also significant challenges, especially among youth.

4. **Currency Stability**: The Turkish lira has experienced substantial depreciation, particularly in the last decade, which has affected economic stability.

5. **Foreign Investment**: Turkey attracted considerable foreign investment in the early 2000s, but political instability and economic challenges have impacted investor confidence in recent years.

6. **Government Debt**: Turkey managed to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio in the early 2000s, but it has been rising again in recent years.

Given these mixed outcomes, the claim that ""the targets have been largely attached"" is not entirely accurate. While there have been periods of significant achievement, there have also been substantial setbacks and challenges.

1. Whether air traffic in Diyarbakır has increased 10 times in the last 10 years.
2. Whether the number of people carried has increased from below 200 thousand to more than 2 million.

Without specific data from reliable sources such as airport traffic reports, government statistics, or credible news articles, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate, the claim would be evaluated as follows:

- If air traffic has indeed increased 10 times over the last 10 years, and
- If the number of passengers has grown from below 200 thousand to over 2 million,

then the claim would be 'True'. 

However, if there are any discrepancies in these figures or if the increase is not exactly 10 times but close, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.

"Over the past 17 years, health care expenditures have increased by 20 times",mostly true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Over the past 17 years, health care expenditures have increased by 20 times,"" we need to examine historical data on health care expenditures.

1. **Historical Data Review**: 
   - According to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) provide official estimates of total health care spending in the United States.
   - In 2005, the total health care expenditure in the U.S. was approximately $2 trillion.
   - In 2022, the total health care expenditure was estimated to be around $4.3 trillion.

2. **Calculation**:
   - To verify the claim, we need to see if the expenditure in 2022 is 20 times that of 2005.
   - $2 trillion (2005) * 20 = $40 trillion.
   - The actual expenditure in 2022 is $4.3 trillion, which is significantly less than $40 trillion.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The increase from $2 trillion to $4.3 trillion over 17 years is a little more than double, not 20 times.

Based on this analysis, the claim that health care expenditures have increased by 20 times over the past 17 years is not supported by the data.

The most votes for the AKP are the places where the risk of earthquakes is the highest.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The most votes for the AKP are the places where the risk of earthquakes is the highest,"" we need to analyze both the voting patterns for the AKP (Justice and Development Party) in Turkey and the geographical distribution of earthquake risks.

1. **Voting Patterns for the AKP**: The AKP has historically received strong support in various regions of Turkey, including both urban and rural areas. Key strongholds include parts of Central Anatolia, the Black Sea region, and some areas in the southeast.

2. **Earthquake Risk in Turkey**: Turkey is situated on several active fault lines, making it prone to earthquakes. The most significant earthquake risks are in the North Anatolian Fault Zone (which affects areas like Istanbul, the Marmara region, and parts of the Aegean region), the East Anatolian Fault Zone, and the Aegean Sea region.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - **Marmara Region**: This region, including Istanbul, is highly prone to earthquakes and has mixed political support, with significant votes for both the AKP and opposition parties.
   - **Central Anatolia**: This region, including Ankara, has strong AKP support but is not the highest in earthquake risk compared to the Marmara or Aegean regions.
   - **Eastern Anatolia**: This region has a high earthquake risk and varying political support, with some areas supporting the AKP and others supporting opposition parties.

Given this analysis, the claim that ""the most votes for the AKP are the places where the risk of earthquakes is the highest"" is an oversimplification. While there are areas with high earthquake risk that support the AKP, there are also significant regions with high earthquake risk that do not predominantly support the AKP. Additionally, some of the AKP's strongholds are not in the highest earthquake risk zones.

1. **Iran's Currency Depreciation**: The claim states that Iran's money lost 48 percent. The Iranian rial has indeed experienced significant depreciation over recent years due to various factors including economic sanctions and internal economic issues. However, the exact percentage can vary depending on the time frame considered. If we look at a specific period, such as a year or a few months, we might find different figures. For instance, in some years, the depreciation might be around 48 percent, but this needs to be verified with reliable financial data sources.

2. **Russian Currency Depreciation**: The claim states that Russian money depreciated 13 percent. The Russian ruble has also faced depreciation, particularly due to sanctions and economic conditions. Again, the exact percentage can vary depending on the specific time frame. For example, during certain periods of economic sanctions or oil price drops, the ruble has seen significant depreciation, but the exact figure of 13 percent needs to be checked against reliable financial data for the specific period in question.

3. **Fluctuations Mentioned**: The claim mentions fluctuations of 1 percent or 2 percent. This part of the claim is vague and does not specify which currency or time frame is being referred to. Fluctuations of 1 to 2 percent are relatively minor and can occur frequently in many currencies due to normal market variations.

Given the need for precise verification of the exact figures and the time frames involved, the claim as stated is difficult to fully validate without more specific data. However, the general trends mentioned (significant depreciation for Iran and Russia, minor fluctuations for another unspecified currency) are broadly consistent with known economic conditions.

37 doctors fall to ten thousand people in OECD countries.We are trying to provide a health service competing with the world in a country where 17 physicians have fallen to 17 thousand population in Greece.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the statistics provided for both OECD countries and Greece.

1. **OECD Countries**: The claim states that there are 37 doctors per 10,000 people in OECD countries. According to the OECD Health Statistics, the average number of doctors per 10,000 people in OECD countries is indeed around 35-40, which aligns with the claim.

2. **Greece**: The claim states that there are 17 physicians per 17,000 people in Greece. This translates to 1 doctor per 1,000 people, or 10 doctors per 10,000 people. However, according to OECD data, Greece actually has one of the highest numbers of doctors per capita among OECD countries, with around 60 doctors per 10,000 people.

Given this information, the claim about Greece is significantly inaccurate.

Equal conditions were created for everyone,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Equal conditions were created for everyone,"" we need to consider the context and the specific circumstances under which this statement is made. Generally, creating truly equal conditions for everyone is a complex and challenging task due to various factors such as socio-economic disparities, historical inequalities, and differing individual needs and circumstances.

In most real-world scenarios, it is difficult to achieve absolute equality in conditions for everyone. There are often systemic barriers, biases, and unequal access to resources that prevent true equality. Therefore, while efforts may be made to create more equal conditions, achieving complete equality is rare.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Because we have increased exports, we have reduced imports in a serious balancing process Türkiye did not shrink.The last two growth figures on a quarterly basis revealed this clearly.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to analyze the economic data and context regarding Türkiye's exports, imports, and growth figures.

1. **Increased Exports and Reduced Imports**: 
   - If Türkiye has indeed increased its exports and reduced its imports, this would typically be reflected in trade balance data. We would need to verify recent trade statistics from reliable sources such as Türkiye's statistical institute or international trade databases.

2. **Balancing Process**:
   - A balancing process in trade usually refers to efforts to reduce trade deficits or achieve a trade surplus. This can be verified by looking at the trade balance over recent quarters.

3. **Türkiye Did Not Shrink**:
   - Economic growth or contraction is measured by GDP figures. If Türkiye's GDP has not contracted, it would support the claim that the economy did not shrink.

4. **Growth Figures on a Quarterly Basis**:
   - The claim mentions that the last two growth figures on a quarterly basis revealed this clearly. We would need to check the quarterly GDP growth rates for the last two quarters to confirm this.

Based on the latest available data (as of 2023):
- Türkiye's trade balance and GDP growth figures can be found in reports from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) and other economic analysis sources.
- If recent data shows an increase in exports, a reduction in imports, and positive GDP growth for the last two quarters, the claim would be supported.

Assuming the data aligns with the claim:
- If Türkiye's exports have increased, imports have decreased, and the GDP growth figures for the last two quarters are positive, the claim would be 'True'.

If there are discrepancies or partial alignment:
- If only some parts of the claim are accurate (e.g., exports increased but imports did not decrease, or GDP growth is not consistent), the claim would be 'Half True' or 'Mostly True'.

Without specific data to verify each point, but assuming the claim is based on accurate and recent economic data:

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu again, 'There is no democracy in Turkey' chose to say.So we just got out of the election.Today, while the elections in Europe are 45 percent, 50 percent, 55 percent, we make elections with 87 percent participation in our country.",half true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts: the statement by Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu about the lack of democracy in Turkey, and the comparison of voter turnout rates between Turkey and European countries.

1. **Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu's Statement on Democracy**: This is a subjective statement and reflects Kılıçdaroğlu's opinion or political stance. Whether there is democracy in Turkey can be debated and depends on various factors such as freedom of the press, judicial independence, and the fairness of elections. This part of the claim is not easily verifiable as it is an opinion.

2. **Voter Turnout Comparison**: The claim states that voter turnout in Turkey is around 87%, while in Europe it ranges from 45% to 55%. 

   - **Turkey's Voter Turnout**: In recent elections, Turkey has indeed had high voter turnout rates. For example, the 2018 general elections had a turnout of approximately 86%.
   - **European Voter Turnout**: Voter turnout in European countries varies widely. For instance, in the 2019 European Parliament elections, the average turnout was around 50.66%. However, national elections in individual European countries can have higher or lower turnout rates. Some countries like Belgium and Denmark often see turnouts above 80%, while others like Switzerland can have much lower rates.

Given the data, the claim about voter turnout in Turkey being higher than in many European countries is generally accurate, though the specific percentages for Europe can vary.

The number of cemevi increased by 8-9 times during our power.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The number of cemevi increased by 8-9 times during our power,"" we need to verify the data on the number of cemevi (Alevi places of worship) before and after the period in question. This would involve looking at reliable sources such as government records, academic studies, or credible news reports that provide statistics on the number of cemevi over time.

Without access to specific data or sources, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume that the claim is made by a political figure or party, it is often subject to scrutiny and fact-checking by independent organizations.

Given the lack of specific data in this context, I cannot conclusively determine the truthfulness of the claim. Therefore, I would need more information to provide a definitive answer.

Final Answer: Unable to determine.",,False,True
"About the free assembly ""The law allows constitutional conditions to abuse",true,az,"The claim ""The law allows constitutional conditions to abuse"" is quite ambiguous and lacks clarity. However, if we interpret it to mean that the law permits conditions that could lead to the abuse of the right to free assembly, it is important to note that constitutional rights, including the right to free assembly, are subject to certain limitations and regulations to ensure public safety, order, and the rights of others. These limitations are generally intended to prevent abuse rather than to allow it.

For example, the government can impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on assemblies, but these restrictions must be content-neutral and narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest. They must also leave open ample alternative channels for communication.

Given this context, the claim that ""The law allows constitutional conditions to abuse"" is misleading. The law aims to balance the right to free assembly with other societal needs and does not inherently allow for abuse.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
"As a real party, we have adopted a law in the minimum of the Milli Majlis",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""As a real party, we have adopted a law in the minimum of the Milli Majlis,"" we need to break down the components:

1. **Real Party**: This implies that the entity making the claim is a legitimate political party.
2. **Adopted a Law**: This means that the party has successfully passed legislation.
3. **Minimum of the Milli Majlis**: The Milli Majlis is the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. The phrase ""in the minimum of the Milli Majlis"" is unclear and ambiguous. It could imply minimal participation or minimal support, but this is not a standard legislative term.

Given the ambiguity and lack of clarity in the phrase ""in the minimum of the Milli Majlis,"" it is difficult to verify the claim without additional context. The statement is not clear enough to be definitively categorized as true or false.

"We examined all our history by lecturing growth and unemployment data.Based on TurkStat data.It turned out that when the 1975-80 period was excluded, the 2015-2020 period we left behind is the worst 5 years in the history of Turkey.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate the economic data for Turkey from the periods mentioned (1975-1980 and 2015-2020) and compare it with other periods in Turkey's history. This involves looking at key economic indicators such as GDP growth rates and unemployment rates.

1. **1975-1980 Period**: This period in Turkey was marked by significant economic challenges, including high inflation, political instability, and economic stagnation. The country faced severe economic crises, which led to a military coup in 1980.

2. **2015-2020 Period**: This period also saw economic difficulties, including a currency crisis in 2018, high inflation, and rising unemployment. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 further exacerbated economic problems.

3. **Comparison with Other Periods**: To assess whether the 2015-2020 period is the worst 5-year period in Turkey's history (excluding 1975-1980), we would need to compare it with other challenging periods in Turkey's economic history, such as the early 2000s financial crisis, the 1994 economic crisis, and other periods of economic instability.

Given the information available and the historical context, the claim that the 2015-2020 period is the worst 5 years in Turkey's history (excluding 1975-1980) appears to be a strong statement. However, without a comprehensive analysis of all historical economic data, it is difficult to definitively confirm this claim.

Our September exports increased by 22.6 percent to 14.5 billion dollars.This is the highest September export figure in history.The ratio of exports to imports was 88.4 percent.This is the highest level of the last 9 years.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify several key points:

1. **September Exports Increase**: The claim states that September exports increased by 22.6 percent to 14.5 billion dollars.
2. **Highest September Export Figure**: The claim asserts that this is the highest September export figure in history.
3. **Ratio of Exports to Imports**: The claim mentions that the ratio of exports to imports was 88.4 percent.
4. **Highest Level in 9 Years**: The claim states that this ratio is the highest level in the last 9 years.

Without access to the specific data from the relevant trade and economic reports, it is challenging to verify each of these points definitively. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate and there are no contradictory reports, the claim could be considered accurate.

Given the structure and specificity of the claim, it appears to be well-supported and detailed. Therefore, based on the information provided and assuming no contrary evidence, the claim seems to be accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
Food reserves in Azerbaijan are sufficient,mostly true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Food reserves in Azerbaijan are sufficient,"" we need to consider various factors such as government reports, international assessments, and recent news regarding food security in Azerbaijan.

1. **Government Reports**: If the Azerbaijani government has released statements or reports indicating that their food reserves are sufficient, this would support the claim.
2. **International Assessments**: Organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) or World Food Programme (WFP) may have assessments or reports on Azerbaijan's food security status.
3. **Recent News**: Current events, such as natural disasters, economic sanctions, or other disruptions, could impact food reserves and should be considered.

Without specific and up-to-date information from these sources, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if recent reports and assessments generally indicate that Azerbaijan has adequate food reserves, the claim could be considered ""Mostly True.""

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,True,False
"YAP CALL SNAP Elections Any Time, The Constitution Allows This",mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""YAP CALL SNAP Elections Any Time, The Constitution Allows This,"" we need to consider the constitutional provisions and legal framework governing the calling of snap elections.

1. **Understanding Snap Elections**: Snap elections are elections that are called earlier than expected. They are typically called by the head of government or the ruling party.

2. **Constitutional Provisions**: The ability to call snap elections depends on the specific country's constitution and legal framework. For example:
   - In the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister can call a snap election, but it requires the approval of two-thirds of the House of Commons or a vote of no confidence.
   - In other parliamentary systems, the head of state (e.g., President or Monarch) may have the power to dissolve the parliament and call for elections, often on the advice of the Prime Minister or equivalent.

3. **YAP Context**: Without specific information about the country or political entity referred to as ""YAP,"" it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume ""YAP"" refers to a parliamentary system where the head of government has the discretion to call elections, the claim could be plausible.

Given the general nature of the claim and the variability in constitutional provisions across different countries, the claim can be considered broadly accurate but not universally applicable.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
We don't have a comment on the list of us,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We don't have a comment on the list of us,"" we need to analyze the statement's context and content. The phrase suggests that there is no comment available regarding a specific list that includes the speaker or their group.

Given that the statement is straightforward and does not provide any additional context or evidence to contradict it, we can take it at face value. If the speaker or the entity they represent indeed has no comment on the list, then the claim is accurate.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
We are in good times in developed European countries,true,az,"To evaluate the claim ""We are in good times in developed European countries,"" we need to consider various factors such as economic indicators, social stability, political climate, and overall quality of life. 

1. **Economic Indicators**: Many developed European countries have strong economies with low unemployment rates, high GDP per capita, and robust social welfare systems. However, some countries face economic challenges, such as high public debt or slow growth.

2. **Social Stability**: Generally, developed European countries enjoy high levels of social stability, low crime rates, and comprehensive healthcare and education systems. However, issues like income inequality, housing affordability, and social unrest in certain areas can be concerns.

3. **Political Climate**: While many European countries have stable political systems, there are instances of political polarization, populism, and challenges related to immigration and integration.

4. **Quality of Life**: Developed European countries often rank high in global quality of life indices, with strong infrastructure, cultural amenities, and environmental standards. Nonetheless, there are disparities within and between countries.

Given these mixed factors, the claim is not entirely accurate but has elements of truth.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"In any country of the world, the president does not take a separate legal protection.",false,tr,"The claim that ""In any country of the world, the president does not take a separate legal protection"" is not accurate. In many countries, presidents do have certain legal protections or immunities while in office. For example, in the United States, the president has certain immunities from prosecution for actions taken in an official capacity. Similarly, in other countries, presidents may have legal protections that shield them from certain types of legal actions while they are in office.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
"Izmir-Istanbul Motorway, 9 billion, 9 billion with financial cost ... Turkey's national income in 1950 is greater.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare the financial cost of the Izmir-Istanbul Motorway with Turkey's national income in 1950.

1. **Izmir-Istanbul Motorway Cost**: The claim states that the cost is 9 billion (presumably in USD or another currency).

2. **Turkey's National Income in 1950**: According to historical economic data, Turkey's GDP in 1950 was approximately $8.6 billion USD.

Given this information:

- The cost of the Izmir-Istanbul Motorway is stated to be 9 billion.
- Turkey's national income in 1950 was approximately $8.6 billion USD.

Since 9 billion is indeed greater than 8.6 billion, the claim that the cost of the Izmir-Istanbul Motorway is greater than Turkey's national income in 1950 is accurate.

"In 17 years, we have given 58 research proposals about earthquakes.(As parliament) AK Party and MHP deputies, ""No earthquake does not need to investigate,"" they said.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. Whether 58 research proposals about earthquakes have been submitted in the past 17 years.
2. Whether AK Party and MHP deputies have stated that ""No earthquake does not need to investigate.""

Without access to specific parliamentary records or statements from AK Party and MHP deputies, it is challenging to verify the exact numbers and the precise wording of their statements. However, if we assume the claim is based on available public records and statements, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the nature of political discourse and the likelihood of some exaggeration or misinterpretation, it is reasonable to consider that the claim might not be entirely accurate but could have elements of truth.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"Admission to the Ministry of Internal Affairs is held on the basis of transparency, publicity and principles of justice",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Admission to the Ministry of Internal Affairs is held on the basis of transparency, publicity and principles of justice,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Transparency**: This implies that the admission process is open and clear, with all procedures and criteria being accessible to the public.
2. **Publicity**: This means that the process is well-publicized, ensuring that information about admissions is widely disseminated.
3. **Principles of Justice**: This suggests that the process is fair, unbiased, and equitable.

The accuracy of this claim can vary significantly depending on the country, the specific Ministry of Internal Affairs in question, and the actual practices in place. In some countries, the admission process may indeed be transparent, publicized, and just. In others, there may be issues such as corruption, lack of transparency, or unfair practices that undermine these principles.

Without specific evidence or data about the practices of a particular Ministry of Internal Affairs, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, given that the claim is an ideal standard rather than a universally verified fact, it is reasonable to consider it as an aspirational statement rather than an absolute truth.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
"It turns out that the heads of political party, ""shed on the street,"" he says.He presents this like a democratic right.There is no such democratic right",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and analyze them:

1. ""It turns out that the heads of political party, 'shed on the street,' he says.""
   - This part of the statement is somewhat unclear and lacks context. It seems to imply that a political party leader has made a statement about ""shedding on the street,"" but without additional context, it's difficult to assess the accuracy.

2. ""He presents this like a democratic right.""
   - This suggests that the political party leader is framing the act of ""shedding on the street"" as a democratic right. Again, the lack of context makes it hard to evaluate the accuracy of this claim.

3. ""There is no such democratic right.""
   - This part of the statement is more straightforward. Generally, democratic rights include freedoms such as speech, assembly, and voting. ""Shedding on the street"" does not align with recognized democratic rights.

Given the lack of clarity and context in the first two parts of the statement, but the clear inaccuracy in the third part, the overall claim can be evaluated as follows:

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
... This power has reduced the savings of the economy to the lowest level in the history of the Republic of Turkey.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""This power has reduced the savings of the economy to the lowest level in the history of the Republic of Turkey,"" we need to examine historical data on savings rates in Turkey. This includes looking at household savings rates, national savings rates, and other relevant economic indicators over time.

1. **Historical Context**: The Republic of Turkey was established in 1923, so the claim covers a long period. We need to compare current savings rates with historical data from various periods, including economic crises, periods of high inflation, and other significant economic events.

2. **Current Data**: Recent data on Turkey's savings rates can be obtained from sources like the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These sources provide insights into the current state of savings in Turkey.

3. **Economic Analysis**: Economic policies, inflation rates, interest rates, and other factors influence savings rates. Analyzing these factors can help determine if the current government’s policies have significantly impacted savings rates.

Without specific data and a thorough analysis, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if recent reports and data indicate that savings rates are indeed at historically low levels, the claim could be considered accurate. Conversely, if savings rates have been lower in the past, the claim would be less accurate.

Given the complexity and the need for precise data, a definitive answer requires detailed economic analysis. However, based on general trends and available information, we can make an educated assessment.

**Assessment**:
- If recent data shows that savings rates are at their lowest since 1923, the claim is 'True'.
- If savings rates are low but not the lowest in history, the claim is 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.
- If savings rates are not significantly low compared to historical data, the claim is 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the need for specific historical and current data, and assuming recent trends indicate low savings rates but not necessarily the lowest in history, the most balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"760,000 People Could Be Unemployed",mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""760,000 People Could Be Unemployed,"" we need to consider the context and the source of the information. The claim is about a potential future event, which inherently involves some level of uncertainty. 

1. **Source and Context**: If the claim is based on a credible source, such as a government report, economic forecast, or a statement from a reputable economist, it would lend more credibility to the claim. 

2. **Current Data**: We should compare the claim to current unemployment data and trends. If the current unemployment rate is significantly lower or higher, it would affect the likelihood of the claim.

3. **Economic Conditions**: Consider the broader economic conditions, such as GDP growth, industry health, and other macroeconomic indicators. If the economy is in a downturn or facing significant challenges, the claim might be more plausible.

4. **Specificity**: The claim is somewhat specific in its number but vague in its timeframe and conditions. This makes it harder to verify definitively.

Given that the claim is about a potential future scenario and assuming it is based on some form of analysis or projection, it is reasonable to consider it as a plausible but uncertain prediction.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The easiest registration of candidates is in Azerbaijan,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The easiest registration of candidates is in Azerbaijan,"" we need to consider several factors, including the legal framework, administrative procedures, and comparative ease of candidate registration in Azerbaijan relative to other countries.

1. **Legal Framework**: Azerbaijan has specific laws and regulations governing the registration of candidates for elections. These laws outline the requirements and procedures that candidates must follow to be registered.

2. **Administrative Procedures**: The ease of registration can be influenced by the efficiency and transparency of the administrative processes involved. This includes the submission of necessary documents, verification processes, and any potential bureaucratic hurdles.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: To claim that Azerbaijan has the ""easiest"" registration process, we would need to compare it with the registration processes in other countries. This involves looking at the requirements (e.g., signatures, deposits, documentation), the time taken for registration, and any barriers that might exist.

Without specific comparative data and detailed analysis of the registration processes in multiple countries, it is challenging to definitively state that Azerbaijan has the ""easiest"" registration process. Additionally, the term ""easiest"" is subjective and can vary based on individual experiences and perspectives.

Given the lack of comprehensive comparative data and the subjective nature of the claim, it is difficult to verify its accuracy.

People from many categories are provided by the state by the state,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""People from many categories are provided by the state by the state,"" we need to analyze its components and context.

1. **Repetition**: The phrase ""by the state by the state"" is repeated, which seems to be an error or redundancy.
2. **Meaning**: The claim suggests that the state provides for people from many categories. This could imply various forms of support such as social services, welfare, education, healthcare, etc., which is generally true for most states.

However, due to the redundancy and lack of clarity in the phrasing, the claim is somewhat confusing.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,True,False
It is a dream that a party in Europe has 41 percent.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""It is a dream that a party in Europe has 41 percent,"" we need to consider the context and historical data of political parties in Europe. 

In many European countries, it is indeed challenging for a single political party to secure 41% of the vote due to the multiparty systems and proportional representation that are common in Europe. However, there have been instances where parties have achieved or come close to this percentage in national elections.

For example:
- In Germany, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have occasionally approached or exceeded 40% in federal elections.
- In Hungary, the Fidesz party led by Viktor Orbán has secured over 40% in recent elections.
- In Poland, the Law and Justice party (PiS) has also achieved similar results.

Given these examples, while it is challenging and not the norm for a party to secure 41% of the vote in Europe, it is not entirely a ""dream"" or impossible.

"Since 2002, the number of students has increased from 1 and a half million to 5 and a half million.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the data regarding the number of students in 2002 and the current number of students. The claim states that the number of students has increased from 1.5 million in 2002 to 5.5 million currently.

Without specific data to verify these numbers, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the numbers provided are accurate, the claim would be 'True'. If there is any discrepancy in the numbers, the categorization would change accordingly.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the numbers, I cannot definitively categorize the claim. However, based on the information provided:

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
Habur passes 7 thousand trucks a day to Iraq.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Habur passes 7 thousand trucks a day to Iraq,"" we need to look at available data and reports regarding the traffic through the Habur border crossing, which is a major gateway between Turkey and Iraq.

The Habur border crossing, also known as the Ibrahim Khalil border crossing on the Iraqi side, is indeed one of the busiest land border crossings in the region. It is a critical route for trade between Turkey and Iraq. Various reports and sources have indicated that the number of trucks passing through this border can be quite high, often in the thousands per day.

For instance, some reports have suggested that the daily truck traffic can range from 4,000 to 7,000 trucks, depending on the time of year and specific economic conditions. However, the exact number can fluctuate due to various factors such as political situations, security conditions, and economic activities.

Given this context, the claim that ""Habur passes 7 thousand trucks a day to Iraq"" is within the realm of possibility, but it may not be consistently accurate every single day. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this claim as generally accurate but with some variability.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
HDP has received votes from the poorest neighborhoods of Turkey and the most fukara districts of Istanbul.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that the HDP (Peoples' Democratic Party) has received votes from the poorest neighborhoods of Turkey and the most fukara (impoverished) districts of Istanbul, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Historical Voting Patterns**: The HDP has traditionally garnered significant support from Kurdish-majority regions in southeastern Turkey, which are often among the poorer areas of the country. This aligns with the claim that the HDP receives votes from poorer neighborhoods.

2. **Socioeconomic Data**: Istanbul, being a large and diverse city, has districts with varying socioeconomic statuses. The HDP has indeed received votes from some of the less affluent districts in Istanbul, such as Esenyurt and Sultangazi, which have significant Kurdish populations and lower average incomes compared to other parts of the city.

3. **Election Results**: Analyzing election results from various districts can provide insight into the voting patterns. In past elections, the HDP has performed well in districts with higher poverty rates and significant Kurdish populations.

Given this context, the claim appears to be supported by historical voting patterns and socioeconomic data.

Final Answer: Mostly True",mostly true,False,False
"Food prices in the world decreased by 20 percent in one year.See the contradiction that while food products in the world are cheaper, we are increasing in us.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to evaluate two main points:

1. **Global Food Prices Decrease**: The claim states that food prices worldwide have decreased by 20 percent in one year. This would require verification from reliable sources such as reports from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) or other reputable economic data sources. If such a significant decrease has been reported, this part of the claim could be considered true.

2. **Food Prices in the US Increasing**: The claim also states that while global food prices are decreasing, food prices in the US are increasing. This would need to be verified with data from sources like the US Bureau of Labor Statistics or other credible economic reports that track food price trends in the US.

If both points are verified to be accurate, the claim could be considered 'True'. If one part is accurate and the other is not, it would be 'Half True'. If neither part is accurate, it would be 'False'. If the data shows a slight decrease or increase that doesn't match the claim's magnitude, it could be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False'.

Given the complexity and the need for specific data verification, without access to the latest data, a precise determination cannot be made here. However, based on general trends and typical economic reports, significant discrepancies between global and US food price trends are uncommon but not impossible.

1. **Meslek Liseleri (Vocational High Schools)**: According to the latest data from the Turkish Ministry of National Education (MEB), vocational high schools constitute a significant portion of the total number of high schools in Türkiye. The percentage can vary slightly from year to year, but it has been reported to be around 40-45%.

2. **Imam Hatip Okulları (Imam Hatip Schools)**: These schools, which combine general education with religious education, have also seen an increase in numbers over the years. The percentage of Imam Hatip schools is generally reported to be around 12-15%.

Given these data points, the claim that vocational high schools make up 44% and Imam Hatip schools make up 13-14% of the total high schools in Türkiye appears to be within the range of reported statistics.

"In the US, the president sits in the presidential palace.He pays his rent, pays the bill of the meal he eats.When a guest comes to his house, he pays the price of the dinner he served to his guests through the tariff of the 5 -star hotel.",half true,tr,"The claim contains several inaccuracies and misconceptions about the living arrangements and financial responsibilities of the President of the United States.

1. **Presidential Palace**: The President of the United States resides in the White House, not a ""presidential palace.""
2. **Rent and Bills**: The President does not pay rent to live in the White House. The costs of maintaining the White House, including utilities and staff, are covered by the federal government. However, the President does pay for personal expenses, such as food for personal consumption and private events.
3. **Meals and Guests**: When the President hosts personal guests, the cost of the food and beverages is typically paid for by the President. However, official state dinners and events are funded by the government.

Given these points, the claim is largely inaccurate.

We are unemployment champions among OECD countries.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are unemployment champions among OECD countries,"" we need to examine the unemployment rates of OECD countries and see where the country in question stands.

1. **OECD Unemployment Data**: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) regularly publishes unemployment statistics for its member countries. These statistics are publicly available and can be used to compare unemployment rates across countries.

2. **Definition of 'Champions'**: The term ""champions"" in this context likely means having the highest unemployment rate among OECD countries.

3. **Current Data**: As of the latest available data, we need to check the unemployment rates of all OECD countries to see if the country in question has the highest rate.

If the country in question indeed has the highest unemployment rate among all OECD countries, the claim would be 'True'. If it has one of the highest rates but not the absolute highest, the claim could be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'. If it is not among the highest, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without specific data at hand, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to verify it:

1. Visit the OECD website or a reliable source that publishes OECD unemployment statistics.
2. Look for the most recent unemployment rates for all member countries.
3. Compare the rates to see where the country in question stands.

Based on the general approach to verifying such claims, I would need the specific country and the latest data to provide a precise answer. However, given the structure of the question and the need for a definitive response:

... The bed capacity of the state and the private sector can meet 10 percent of the need.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The bed capacity of the state and the private sector can meet 10 percent of the need,"" we would need specific data on the total bed capacity available in both the state and private sectors, as well as the total demand for beds. Without this data, it is challenging to definitively assess the claim.

However, if we assume that the claim is based on accurate and verified data, then it could be considered true. Conversely, if the data is incorrect or misrepresented, the claim could be false.

Given the lack of specific data to verify the claim, it is not possible to definitively categorize it as 'True' or 'False'. Therefore, the most appropriate response based on the available information would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
SOCAR Karbamidi carries out 20% lower in Azerbaijan,mostly true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""SOCAR Karbamidi carries out 20% lower in Azerbaijan,"" we need to understand the context and specific metrics being referred to. The phrase ""carries out 20% lower"" is ambiguous and could refer to various aspects such as production levels, emissions, costs, or other operational metrics.

1. **Production Levels**: If the claim refers to production levels being 20% lower, we would need data on SOCAR Karbamidi's production figures over a specific period to verify this.
2. **Emissions**: If the claim refers to emissions being 20% lower, we would need environmental reports or emissions data.
3. **Costs**: If the claim refers to operational costs being 20% lower, financial reports or cost analysis would be necessary.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to verify the claim accurately. However, based on the information provided, the claim is too vague to be definitively assessed.

"Only Ankara University was opened during the period of the CHP alone for 25 years, and over 100 universities were opened under the 13 -year AK Party government.",true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to consider the historical context and the actual data regarding university establishments in Turkey.

1. **Ankara University and CHP Period**:
   - The Republican People's Party (CHP) was the ruling party in Turkey from the establishment of the Republic in 1923 until 1950.
   - Ankara University was indeed established in 1946 during the CHP period.
   - However, other higher education institutions were also established during this period, such as Istanbul Technical University (ITU) in 1944, which was a reorganization of the existing Istanbul School of Engineering.

2. **AK Party Period**:
   - The Justice and Development Party (AK Party) has been in power since 2002.
   - During the AK Party's tenure, there has been a significant increase in the number of universities. According to various sources, over 100 new universities have been established since 2002.

Given this information:

- The claim that ""Only Ankara University was opened during the period of the CHP alone for 25 years"" is not entirely accurate because other institutions like ITU were also established or reorganized during this period.
- The claim that ""over 100 universities were opened under the 13-year AK Party government"" is accurate.

Therefore, the claim is a mix of accurate and inaccurate information.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"It only includes Pasha Sigorta, ""Pasha Sigorta, which excludes 50% of the insurance market",true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the market share of Pasha Sigorta in the insurance market. The claim states that Pasha Sigorta ""excludes 50% of the insurance market,"" which implies that Pasha Sigorta does not cover or is not involved in 50% of the market.

If Pasha Sigorta indeed has a market share of 50%, it would mean it includes 50% of the market and excludes the other 50%. However, if Pasha Sigorta has a different market share, the claim would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Without specific data on Pasha Sigorta's market share, we cannot definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate data, it would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
We are the first country from 47 member states of the Council of Europe that today we present the mobile application of the e-court today,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Whether the country in question is indeed the first among the 47 member states of the Council of Europe to present a mobile application for an e-court.
2. Whether the mobile application for the e-court is indeed being presented today.

Without specific information or evidence to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the statement is made by a credible source and there is no contradictory information available, we might lean towards a certain level of truth.

Given the lack of specific evidence to fully confirm or refute the claim, the most cautious and balanced assessment would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Human rights are quite bad in terms of human rights;Our biggest priority in our country, which is increasingly discredited, is to make human rights the highest article of the agenda.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""Human rights are quite bad in terms of human rights.""
2. ""Our biggest priority in our country, which is increasingly discredited, is to make human rights the highest article of the agenda.""

For the first part, the statement is somewhat tautological and vague. It essentially says that human rights are bad in terms of human rights, which doesn't provide specific information or context. However, if we interpret it to mean that the state of human rights in the country is poor, this could be evaluated based on reports from human rights organizations, government records, and other credible sources.

For the second part, it claims that the country's biggest priority is to make human rights the highest item on the agenda. This can be assessed by looking at government policies, public statements by officials, and legislative actions to see if there is a strong focus on improving human rights.

Without specific information about the country in question, it is challenging to definitively assess the accuracy of these claims. However, given the general nature of the statements and the lack of specific evidence provided, the claim appears to be somewhat ambiguous and not fully substantiated.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
2.9 percent growth means that the citizen is becoming poor.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""2.9 percent growth means that the citizen is becoming poor,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Economic Growth Context**: A 2.9 percent growth rate typically refers to the growth of a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP growth is a measure of economic performance and indicates how much the economy is expanding.

2. **Inflation**: If the inflation rate is higher than 2.9 percent, the real purchasing power of citizens could be decreasing, which might lead to a situation where citizens feel poorer despite GDP growth.

3. **Income Distribution**: GDP growth does not necessarily mean that all citizens benefit equally. If the growth is not inclusive and the benefits are concentrated among the wealthy, the average citizen might not see an improvement in their economic situation.

4. **Other Economic Indicators**: Factors such as employment rates, wage growth, and cost of living also play crucial roles in determining whether citizens are becoming poorer or wealthier.

Given these considerations, a 2.9 percent GDP growth rate alone does not provide enough information to definitively state that citizens are becoming poorer. It depends on the broader economic context, including inflation, income distribution, and other economic indicators.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"When we came to power, the National Education budget was not in the first place, but it was behind.We took it to the first place.We devoted half of our budget to national education.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The position of the National Education budget before the party came to power.
2. The current position of the National Education budget after the party came to power.
3. Whether half of the budget is indeed devoted to national education.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, based on general knowledge and typical budget allocations in most countries, it is uncommon for half of a national budget to be devoted to education. Education budgets are significant but usually do not constitute half of the total national budget.

Given the lack of specific data to support the claim and the general improbability of such a high allocation, the claim seems exaggerated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
New voters come into play every year from 1.6-1.7 million Z generation,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""New voters come into play every year from 1.6-1.7 million Z generation,"" we need to consider the demographic data and voting eligibility criteria.

Generation Z typically refers to individuals born from the mid-to-late 1990s to the early 2010s. As of 2023, the oldest members of Generation Z would be around 26-27 years old, and the youngest would be around 10-13 years old. In the United States, individuals become eligible to vote at the age of 18.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 4 million people are born each year in the United States. If we assume that the birth rate has been relatively stable, this would mean that roughly 4 million individuals turn 18 each year. However, not all of these individuals are part of Generation Z, as some would be from the tail end of the Millennial generation or the beginning of the next generation.

Given that the claim specifies 1.6-1.7 million new voters from Generation Z each year, this number seems plausible but somewhat conservative compared to the total number of new 18-year-olds annually. It is possible that the claim is focusing on a specific subset of Generation Z or accounting for factors such as voter registration rates and citizenship status.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
We are 68th in 180 countries in the Economic Freedom Index.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are 68th in 180 countries in the Economic Freedom Index,"" we need to verify the most recent data from a reliable source, such as the Heritage Foundation or the Fraser Institute, which publish annual reports on economic freedom.

1. **Heritage Foundation's Economic Freedom Index**: This index ranks countries based on various factors such as rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. The latest report should be checked to see the current ranking of the country in question.

2. **Fraser Institute's Economic Freedom of the World Report**: This report also ranks countries based on similar criteria. The latest report should be consulted for the current ranking.

Given that the rankings can change annually based on economic policies and conditions, it is essential to refer to the most recent publication.

Assuming the claim is about a specific country, let's hypothetically check the latest available data:

- If the latest report from the Heritage Foundation or Fraser Institute confirms that the country is indeed ranked 68th out of 180 countries, the claim would be 'True'.
- If the ranking is close but not exactly 68th, the claim might be 'Mostly True' or 'Half True'.
- If the ranking is significantly different, the claim would be 'Mostly False' or 'False'.

Without access to the latest data at this moment, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, I can guide you on how to check:

1. Visit the Heritage Foundation's website and look for the latest Economic Freedom Index report.
2. Visit the Fraser Institute's website and look for the latest Economic Freedom of the World report.
3. Compare the ranking of the country in question in these reports.

Final Answer: Without the latest data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. Please check the most recent Economic Freedom Index reports from the Heritage Foundation or Fraser Institute for accurate information.",,False,True
The OSCE does not comment on the events in Armenia,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The OSCE does not comment on the events in Armenia,"" we need to consider the role and actions of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

The OSCE is an intergovernmental organization that addresses a wide range of security-related concerns, including arms control, human rights, and conflict prevention. It often issues statements and comments on events in its member states, including Armenia, especially if those events pertain to its mandate.

Historically, the OSCE has commented on various events in Armenia, such as elections, political developments, and conflicts. For example, the OSCE has monitored elections in Armenia and issued reports and statements regarding their conduct. Additionally, the OSCE Minsk Group has been involved in mediating the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which directly involves Armenia.

Given this context, the claim that ""The OSCE does not comment on the events in Armenia"" is not accurate.

Azerbaijan's economy is 75% of the total economy of the South Caucasus,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan's economy is 75% of the total economy of the South Caucasus,"" we need to look at the GDP figures of the countries in the South Caucasus region, which includes Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia.

According to the most recent data available from sources like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF):

1. Azerbaijan's GDP is significantly larger than that of Armenia and Georgia.
2. As of the latest data, Azerbaijan's GDP is approximately $54 billion.
3. Georgia's GDP is around $18 billion.
4. Armenia's GDP is about $13 billion.

Adding these up, the total GDP of the South Caucasus region is approximately $85 billion.

To find the percentage of Azerbaijan's GDP in the total South Caucasus GDP:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Azerbaijan's GDP}}{\text{Total GDP of South Caucasus}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{54}{85} \right) \times 100 \approx 63.5\% \]

Given this calculation, Azerbaijan's economy constitutes approximately 63.5% of the total economy of the South Caucasus, not 75%.

"Between 2002 and 2012, the global real growth rate was 2.7 percent, while the Islamic countries grew by 5.4 percent on average in the same period.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the global real growth rate and the growth rate of Islamic countries between 2002 and 2012.

1. **Global Real Growth Rate**: According to data from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global real GDP growth rate fluctuated over the years, but the average annual growth rate for the world economy during this period was approximately 2.7%.

2. **Growth Rate of Islamic Countries**: The term ""Islamic countries"" typically refers to member countries of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). According to various economic reports and data from the Islamic Development Bank and other sources, many OIC countries experienced higher growth rates during this period, driven by factors such as high oil prices, economic reforms, and increased investment. The average growth rate for these countries was indeed higher than the global average, with some estimates placing it around 5.4%.

Given this information, the claim that the global real growth rate was 2.7 percent and that Islamic countries grew by 5.4 percent on average between 2002 and 2012 appears to be accurate.

Türkiye has been one of the 20 largest economies in the world since 1980.,true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye has been one of the 20 largest economies in the world since 1980,"" we need to examine historical economic data.

Türkiye's economy has experienced significant growth and development over the past few decades. However, its position among the world's largest economies has fluctuated. While Türkiye has often been ranked among the top 20 economies in recent years, it has not consistently held this position since 1980.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Türkiye's economy was not always ranked within the top 20 globally. It was only in the 2000s and beyond that Türkiye more consistently appeared in the top 20, particularly due to economic reforms and growth during that period.

Given this context, the claim that Türkiye has been one of the 20 largest economies in the world since 1980 is not entirely accurate.

"It does not seem possible that the satisfaction rates from the judiciary are far above.Half of those who have fallen to the judiciary loses, half of them ... Despite this, the satisfaction of the judiciary in 2016 was 52.4 percent.This is a good figure.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the statements and verify them against available data and logical consistency.

1. **Satisfaction Rates from the Judiciary**: The claim states that the satisfaction rate with the judiciary in 2016 was 52.4 percent. This is a specific figure that can be verified with data from surveys or studies conducted in 2016.

2. **Logical Consistency**: The claim also mentions that half of those who fall to the judiciary lose, which is a logical statement since in most judicial cases, there is a winner and a loser. However, satisfaction rates are not necessarily tied to winning or losing a case. Satisfaction can be influenced by factors such as perceived fairness, efficiency, and transparency of the judicial process.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: The statement ""It does not seem possible that the satisfaction rates from the judiciary are far above"" is subjective and not necessarily a factual claim. It reflects a personal opinion or skepticism.

Given the specific figure of 52.4 percent satisfaction in 2016, if this figure is accurate based on available data, then the claim about the satisfaction rate is correct. The logical statement about half losing and half winning is also generally true in a binary judicial outcome.

**Verification**: Without specific data to confirm the exact satisfaction rate in 2016, we can only assess the logical consistency and general plausibility of the claim.

"Economic indicators give alarm, our citizens are becoming increasingly impoverished.Türkiye is a lack of investment.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine the current economic indicators and investment climate in Türkiye (Turkey).

1. **Economic Indicators and Poverty**:
   - **Inflation**: Turkey has experienced high inflation rates in recent years, which can erode purchasing power and lead to increased poverty.
   - **Unemployment**: The unemployment rate is another critical indicator. High unemployment can contribute to poverty.
   - **GDP Growth**: While Turkey has had periods of economic growth, the benefits may not be evenly distributed, potentially leading to increased poverty for some segments of the population.

2. **Investment Climate**:
   - **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**: Trends in FDI can indicate the level of international confidence in Turkey's economy. A decline in FDI could suggest a lack of investment.
   - **Domestic Investment**: Domestic investment levels are also crucial. Economic instability, political issues, or other factors can deter both foreign and domestic investors.

Given the recent economic challenges Turkey has faced, including high inflation and economic instability, it is reasonable to conclude that these factors could contribute to increasing poverty and a challenging investment climate.

1. **Initial Dollar Rate and Purchasing Power in 2009:**
   - The claim states that on January 1, 2009, the dollar rate was 1.52 TL per USD.
   - With 200 TL, you could purchase $131 (200 TL / 1.52 TL/USD ≈ $131.58).

2. **Current Dollar Rate and Purchasing Power:**
   - The claim states that the current dollar rate is 7.16 TL per USD.
   - With 200 TL, you can purchase $27 (200 TL / 7.16 TL/USD ≈ $27.93).

3. **Comparison of Purchasing Power:**
   - In 2009, 200 TL could purchase approximately $131.
   - Today, 200 TL can purchase approximately $27.

4. **Conclusion on the Loss of Value:**
   - The Turkish Lira has indeed lost significant value over this period, as the purchasing power in terms of USD has decreased from approximately $131 to $27.

Given the calculations and the comparison, the claim appears to be accurate in terms of the exchange rates and the resulting purchasing power of the Turkish Lira over the specified period.

Police are professionally fishing the functions,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Police are professionally fishing the functions,"" we need to analyze the statement for clarity and factual basis.

1. **Clarity**: The phrase ""professionally fishing the functions"" is ambiguous and unclear. It does not specify what ""functions"" are being referred to or what ""fishing"" means in this context. Typically, ""fishing"" could imply searching or investigating, but without a clear context, it's difficult to interpret.

2. **Factual Basis**: There is no widely recognized or documented activity known as ""professionally fishing the functions"" that police are known to engage in. Police duties generally include law enforcement, investigation, public safety, and community service, but the phrase in question does not align with any standard police activities.

Given the lack of clarity and factual basis, the claim does not hold up to scrutiny.

As of my last update in 2021, the drug use rate in Turkey was reported to be around 2.7 percent according to some sources, but this figure can vary depending on the specific type of drug use being measured (e.g., lifetime use, past year use, etc.) and the demographic being studied.

Given that the claim is specific and matches some reported figures, but without the most recent data to confirm its current accuracy, the claim can be considered as:

"The UN Facts Commission was based on my proposal ... Again, thanks to our work, Gaza attacks became an official report, it is the first in its history.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two main parts:

1. ""The UN Facts Commission was based on my proposal.""
2. ""Thanks to our work, Gaza attacks became an official report, it is the first in its history.""

For the first part, there is no widely known or documented evidence that a specific individual proposed the creation of the UN Facts Commission. The United Nations typically establishes commissions and fact-finding missions through resolutions and collective decisions by member states, not based on individual proposals.

For the second part, the United Nations has conducted various investigations and produced reports on Gaza over the years. For example, the Goldstone Report in 2009 was a significant UN report on the Gaza conflict. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that a report on Gaza attacks is the first in its history.

Given these points, the claim appears to be largely inaccurate.

"Turkey, gasoline prices Russia, Belarus and Moldova behind the cheapest gasoline in Europe ... the lowest in electricity price is the third country",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. **Gasoline Prices in Turkey**: The claim suggests that Turkey has some of the cheapest gasoline prices in Europe, behind Russia, Belarus, and Moldova.
2. **Electricity Prices in Turkey**: The claim states that Turkey has the third lowest electricity prices in Europe.

### Gasoline Prices
- **Russia, Belarus, and Moldova**: These countries are known for having some of the lowest gasoline prices in Europe due to various factors, including subsidies and lower taxes.
- **Turkey**: Historically, Turkey has not been known for having particularly low gasoline prices compared to other European countries. In fact, Turkey often has higher gasoline prices due to high taxes and import costs.

### Electricity Prices
- **Turkey's Electricity Prices**: Turkey's electricity prices are generally lower than many Western European countries but are not typically ranked as the third lowest in Europe. Countries like Ukraine, Georgia, and Kosovo often have lower electricity prices.

### Conclusion
Given the information available, the claim that Turkey has some of the cheapest gasoline prices in Europe behind Russia, Belarus, and Moldova is likely inaccurate. Additionally, the claim that Turkey has the third lowest electricity prices in Europe is also not supported by typical data.

"Internal security reform is not new.Molotov was already counted as a weapon, closing his face, punishment was foreseen for those who demonstrated",true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break it down into its components:

1. ""Internal security reform is not new.""
   - This is generally true. Internal security reforms have been a part of governance in many countries throughout history.

2. ""Molotov was already counted as a weapon.""
   - The Molotov cocktail, an improvised incendiary device, has been used as a weapon since the Spanish Civil War and was named after Vyacheslav Molotov, a Soviet politician, during the Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland (1939-1940).

3. ""Closing his face, punishment was foreseen for those who demonstrated.""
   - This part is somewhat unclear. If it refers to laws or regulations that penalize demonstrators, especially those who conceal their identities (e.g., wearing masks), such measures have been implemented in various countries at different times. However, the phrasing is ambiguous and lacks specific historical context.

Given the information, the claim contains elements of truth but is somewhat disjointed and lacks clarity in its final part. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate but has some basis in fact.

"The municipality has done, sold the most expensive water in Turkey, Ankara is the first.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The municipality has done, sold the most expensive water in Turkey, Ankara is the first,"" we need to verify several aspects:

1. **Municipality's Role**: Whether the municipality is responsible for setting and selling water prices.
2. **Price Comparison**: Whether Ankara's water prices are indeed the highest in Turkey.
3. **Current Data**: The most recent and reliable data on water prices across different municipalities in Turkey.

Without specific data or sources to confirm these points, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general knowledge and typical practices, municipalities do have control over local utilities, including water pricing. Yet, the claim that Ankara has the most expensive water in Turkey would require specific and up-to-date comparative data.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the claim, it is prudent to err on the side of caution.

"Over the past 15 years, salary 7 times, pensions have increased 9 times",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Over the past 15 years, salary 7 times, pensions have increased 9 times,"" we need to consider the following:

1. **Data Verification**: We need to verify historical data on salary and pension increases over the past 15 years.
2. **Context**: The claim should be evaluated in the context of the specific country or region it refers to, as economic conditions and policies vary widely.
3. **Inflation Adjustment**: Consider whether the increases are nominal or adjusted for inflation.

Without specific data or context, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general economic trends, such significant increases in both salaries and pensions over a 15-year period seem unusually high. Typically, salary and pension increases are more modest and closely tied to inflation rates and economic growth.

Given the lack of specific data to support the claim and the general economic trends, the claim appears to be exaggerated.

The Azerbaijani people boycott the elections with the National Council,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Azerbaijani people boycott the elections with the National Council,"" we need to consider the context and historical events related to elections in Azerbaijan.

The National Council of Democratic Forces (NCDF) is a coalition of opposition parties and groups in Azerbaijan. There have been instances where the NCDF and other opposition groups have called for boycotts of elections, citing reasons such as lack of fair competition, government repression, and electoral fraud. However, whether the Azerbaijani people as a whole participate in these boycotts can vary.

In some elections, a significant portion of the opposition and their supporters may heed the call to boycott, but it is not accurate to say that the entire Azerbaijani population boycotts the elections. Voter turnout in Azerbaijan has varied, and while opposition boycotts can impact turnout, they do not result in a complete boycott by the entire population.

Given this context, the claim is an overgeneralization. It is more accurate to say that some Azerbaijani people, particularly those aligned with the opposition, may participate in boycotts organized by the National Council, but it is not representative of the entire population.

"(With Russia) last year, we increased by 30 percent in our trade volume.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""(With Russia) last year, we increased by 30 percent in our trade volume,"" we need to verify the trade data between the two countries for the specified period.

1. **Identify the countries involved**: The claim does not specify which country is making the statement. For the sake of this analysis, let's assume it is a country with significant trade relations with Russia, such as Turkey, China, or Germany.

2. **Check the trade data**: We need to look at the official trade statistics from reliable sources such as government trade departments, international trade organizations, or reputable economic research institutions.

3. **Compare the trade volumes**: We need to compare the trade volume between the two countries for the last year with the previous year to see if there was indeed a 30 percent increase.

Without specific data, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, if we assume the claim is made by a country with significant trade relations with Russia and there is no immediate contradictory evidence, we can make an educated guess.

Given the context of global trade dynamics and the impact of various factors such as sanctions, economic policies, and geopolitical events, a 30 percent increase in trade volume is plausible but needs verification.

**Example Verification**:
- If the claim is made by Turkey, we can check the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) for trade data with Russia.
- If the claim is made by China, we can check the General Administration of Customs of China for trade data with Russia.
- If the claim is made by Germany, we can check the Federal Statistical Office of Germany (Destatis) for trade data with Russia.

**Hypothetical Data Check**:
- Suppose the trade volume between Turkey and Russia in 2021 was $30 billion.
- If the trade volume in 2022 increased to $39 billion, this would represent a 30 percent increase.

Based on the hypothetical data and assuming no contradictory evidence, the claim could be considered accurate.

"59 of the 1,235 workers who lost their lives in 2013 in Turkey are children.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""59 of the 1,235 workers who lost their lives in 2013 in Turkey are children,"" we need to verify the statistics regarding worker fatalities in Turkey for the year 2013, specifically focusing on the number of child fatalities.

1. **Total Worker Fatalities in 2013**: According to various reports and sources, including data from labor organizations and government agencies, the total number of worker fatalities in Turkey in 2013 is often cited as around 1,235.

2. **Child Worker Fatalities**: Reports from labor rights organizations and news articles indicate that a significant number of child workers lost their lives in Turkey in 2013. The figure of 59 child fatalities is mentioned in several sources, suggesting that this number is based on documented cases and investigations by labor rights groups.

Given the consistency of these figures in multiple sources, the claim appears to be well-supported by available data.

The subway will not carry a rally near 200 meters,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The subway will not carry a rally near 200 meters,"" we need to break down the statement and analyze its components.

1. **Subway Operations**: Subways typically operate on fixed tracks and schedules, and their operation is generally not influenced by events happening above ground unless there are specific safety concerns or directives from authorities.

2. **Proximity to Events**: If a rally or large gathering is happening near a subway station, it is possible that authorities might temporarily close the station or reroute trains for safety reasons. However, this is not a standard practice and would depend on the specific circumstances of the rally.

3. **Distance Specification**: The claim specifies ""near 200 meters."" This is a relatively short distance, and it is unlikely that a subway system would alter its operations solely based on a rally occurring within this range unless there are significant safety concerns.

Given these points, the claim that ""The subway will not carry a rally near 200 meters"" is generally not accurate as a blanket statement. Subways typically continue to operate unless there are specific safety directives.

"Last year, Baku ranked in the first 50 in the ranking of the world's safest cities",true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Last year, Baku ranked in the first 50 in the ranking of the world's safest cities,"" we need to refer to credible sources that provide rankings of the world's safest cities. These sources could include reports from organizations such as the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), Numbeo, or other reputable entities that compile safety indices.

1. **Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) Safe Cities Index**: The EIU publishes an annual Safe Cities Index that ranks cities based on various safety metrics. Checking the latest available report from the previous year would provide insight into Baku's ranking.

2. **Numbeo Crime Index**: Numbeo provides a crowd-sourced global database of perceived crime rates and safety. It ranks cities based on user-contributed data. Checking Baku's position in the previous year's data can help verify the claim.

3. **Other Reputable Sources**: Other organizations or studies that rank city safety could also be considered, provided they are recognized and credible.

Without access to the specific data from these sources, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, based on general knowledge and typical rankings, Baku is not commonly listed among the top 50 safest cities in the world in major reports.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
We are 45th among the strong states,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""We are 45th among the strong states,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Context**: What is meant by ""strong states""? This could refer to economic strength, education, healthcare, infrastructure, or other metrics.
2. **Source**: Is there a reliable source or ranking that places the state in the 45th position among ""strong states""?
3. **Comparison**: How does this ranking compare to other states in the same category?

Without specific context or a reliable source to verify the claim, it is difficult to determine its accuracy. However, if we assume that ""strong states"" refers to a general ranking of states based on a composite index of various factors, and there is no widely recognized ranking that places a state at 45th position, the claim would likely be inaccurate.

Final Answer: False",false,True,False
(Regarding hazelnuts) Still no explanation at neither yield nor price point.We are talking about a product that earns $ 3.5 billion in this country.,false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. The lack of explanation regarding yield or price point of hazelnuts.
2. The assertion that hazelnuts earn $3.5 billion in the country.

First, let's address the yield and price point. If there is indeed no explanation provided for either the yield or the price point of hazelnuts, this part of the claim could be considered accurate. However, this would require specific context or evidence showing that such explanations are missing.

Second, the $3.5 billion earnings from hazelnuts. According to various sources, Turkey is the largest producer of hazelnuts, and the industry is indeed worth billions of dollars. However, the exact figure can vary based on market conditions, production levels, and other economic factors.

Given that the claim combines two separate points (lack of explanation and the $3.5 billion earnings), and assuming the $3.5 billion figure is reasonably accurate based on available data, the claim can be considered mostly accurate but not entirely without context.

"In the early 1990s, when the late Özal delivered this country, the income per capita fell lower in 2002 before the AK Party government.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to examine historical economic data for Turkey, specifically focusing on the periods mentioned: the early 1990s, 2002, and the onset of the AK Party government.

1. **Turgut Özal's Era (1983-1993)**: Turgut Özal served as Prime Minister from 1983 to 1989 and as President from 1989 until his death in 1993. During his tenure, Turkey experienced significant economic reforms and liberalization, which initially boosted economic growth and income per capita.

2. **Economic Situation in 2002**: By 2002, Turkey had experienced several economic crises, including a severe one in 2001. The economic instability and crises led to a significant drop in income per capita.

3. **AK Party Government (Post-2002)**: The AK Party came to power in late 2002. Under their governance, Turkey saw a period of economic recovery and growth, which led to an increase in income per capita over the subsequent years.

Given this context, the claim suggests that the income per capita in Turkey fell to a lower point in 2002 compared to the early 1990s under Özal's leadership. Historical economic data supports this assertion, as the economic crises in the late 1990s and early 2000s did indeed result in a lower income per capita by 2002.

"While the number of universities per 1 million people is 2.2 in Turkey, this number exceeded 10 in the USA, Denmark, Malaysia, Poland, Switzerland and Norway.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the number of universities per 1 million people in the mentioned countries. This involves checking reliable sources such as educational statistics databases, government reports, or reputable international organizations.

1. **Turkey**: According to the Council of Higher Education in Turkey, there are approximately 207 universities in Turkey. With a population of around 84 million, this gives roughly 2.46 universities per 1 million people, which is close to the stated 2.2.

2. **USA**: The United States has over 4,000 degree-granting institutions. With a population of about 331 million, this results in approximately 12 universities per 1 million people.

3. **Denmark**: Denmark has around 8 universities and a population of about 5.8 million, resulting in approximately 1.38 universities per 1 million people.

4. **Malaysia**: Malaysia has around 20 public universities and numerous private institutions. With a population of about 32 million, the number of universities per 1 million people is significantly higher than 10.

5. **Poland**: Poland has around 400 higher education institutions. With a population of about 38 million, this results in approximately 10.5 universities per 1 million people.

6. **Switzerland**: Switzerland has around 12 universities and a population of about 8.5 million, resulting in approximately 1.41 universities per 1 million people.

7. **Norway**: Norway has around 10 universities and a population of about 5.4 million, resulting in approximately 1.85 universities per 1 million people.

Based on these calculations, the claim is not accurate for Denmark, Switzerland, and Norway, but it is accurate for the USA, Malaysia, and Poland.

No masks can be used in any demonstration in applications in Europe and the United States.Using a mask will be taken away,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider the laws and regulations regarding the use of masks in demonstrations in Europe and the United States.

1. **United States**: 
   - The laws regarding the use of masks in demonstrations vary by state and city. Some places have anti-mask laws that prohibit the wearing of masks in public gatherings, especially if the intent is to conceal identity. For example, New York has an anti-mask law that dates back to 1845. However, these laws are not uniformly enforced and can be subject to exceptions, such as for health reasons or during pandemics.

2. **Europe**:
   - Similarly, in Europe, the regulations vary by country. Some countries have laws that restrict the use of masks in public demonstrations to prevent anonymity and potential violence. For instance, Germany has laws against masking during protests. However, other countries may have more lenient or no specific regulations regarding masks in demonstrations.

Given the variability and the fact that not all places in Europe and the United States have a blanket ban on masks in demonstrations, the claim that ""No masks can be used in any demonstration in applications in Europe and the United States"" is an overgeneralization.

"Nominal income of the population 9.4, bank deposits 33.2, the economy, 19.4, average monthly nominal salary 7, the average monthly amount of pensions increased by 9.3 times",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the specific figures mentioned: nominal income of the population, bank deposits, the economy, average monthly nominal salary, and the increase in the average monthly amount of pensions. Without specific context or data sources to compare these figures against, it is challenging to definitively assess the truthfulness of the claim.

However, based on the structure and presentation of the claim, it appears to be a collection of disparate economic indicators without clear context or reference points. This makes it difficult to verify the accuracy of each figure.

Given the lack of context and verifiable data, the claim cannot be fully validated or refuted.

"Diaspora Committee: ""US Congress recognized the occupation of Azerbaijani territories""",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""US Congress recognized the occupation of Azerbaijani territories,"" we need to examine the historical and legislative context.

1. **Historical Context**: The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region has been ongoing for decades. Various international bodies and countries have taken different stances on the issue.

2. **US Congress Actions**: The US Congress has passed resolutions and made statements regarding the conflict. However, the specific recognition of ""occupation"" by Azerbaijani territories would require a clear and explicit resolution or statement from Congress.

3. **Research**: There is no widely recognized or documented instance where the US Congress has officially passed a resolution explicitly recognizing the occupation of Azerbaijani territories. The US has generally called for peaceful resolutions and negotiations between the parties involved.

Given the lack of clear evidence supporting the claim that the US Congress has officially recognized the occupation of Azerbaijani territories, the claim appears to be misleading.

Eğitim bütçesinin yaklaşık yüzde 90'ını zorunlu harcamalar oluşturmaktadır.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Eğitim bütçesinin yaklaşık yüzde 90'ını zorunlu harcamalar oluşturmaktadır"" (which translates to ""Approximately 90% of the education budget consists of mandatory expenses""), we need to consider the following:

1. **Definition of Mandatory Expenses**: Mandatory expenses typically include salaries, benefits, and other fixed costs that are essential for the operation of educational institutions.

2. **Budget Analysis**: The specific breakdown of the education budget can vary by country and over time. In many countries, a significant portion of the education budget is indeed allocated to mandatory expenses such as teacher salaries, administrative costs, and maintenance of facilities.

3. **Contextual Data**: Without specific data from a particular country or year, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, it is common for a large portion of education budgets to be consumed by these fixed costs.

Given the general trend in many educational systems where a substantial part of the budget is allocated to mandatory expenses, the claim seems plausible.

"There was no council that gathered the Turkish states together until the AK Party came to power.He founded the Republic of Turkey, where Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was headed by the Turkish Council.",mostly false,tr,"The claim contains several inaccuracies and misrepresentations. 

1. The Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, not Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Erdoğan is a contemporary political leader who has served as Prime Minister and President of Turkey, but he did not found the Republic.

2. The Turkish Council, also known as the Cooperation Council of Turkic-Speaking States (Turkic Council), was established in 2009. While it is true that this occurred during the tenure of the AK Party, it is not accurate to say that there was no council or cooperation among Turkic states before this. Various forms of cooperation and meetings among Turkic states existed prior to the formal establishment of the Turkic Council.

Given these points, the claim is largely incorrect.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Türkiye has been the country that reduces the unemployment rate among OECD countries,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye has been the country that reduces the unemployment rate among OECD countries,"" we need to examine recent data and reports from the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) regarding unemployment rates.

1. **OECD Data**: The OECD regularly publishes data on unemployment rates for its member countries. This data includes both the current unemployment rates and changes over time.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: To verify the claim, we need to compare Türkiye's unemployment rate reduction with that of other OECD countries over a specific period.

3. **Recent Trends**: If recent trends show that Türkiye has had the most significant reduction in unemployment rates compared to other OECD countries, the claim could be considered true.

Without access to the most recent and specific data, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim. However, based on general knowledge and trends, Türkiye has faced economic challenges, including fluctuating unemployment rates, which may not necessarily position it as the leading country in reducing unemployment among OECD members.

"2002-2014, do you know how many people died in occupational accidents?15 thousand 7 workers died in work murders.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""15 thousand 7 workers died in work murders"" between 2002 and 2014, we need to verify the data on occupational fatalities for that period.

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) and other sources, occupational accidents and work-related diseases cause a significant number of deaths globally each year. However, specific data for the exact number of deaths in occupational accidents in a particular country or globally from 2002 to 2014 would be required to confirm the claim.

Given the lack of specific data in the provided context, it is challenging to verify the exact number of 15,007 deaths. However, considering the general trends and available data, the number seems plausible but cannot be confirmed without precise statistics.

Ogtay Asadov said that PACE Dilgam Asgarov and Shahbaz Guliyev were silent,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Ogtay Asadov said that PACE Dilgam Asgarov and Shahbaz Guliyev were silent,"" we need to verify if Ogtay Asadov, a notable Azerbaijani politician, made such a statement and if it aligns with the context of the situation involving Dilgam Asgarov and Shahbaz Guliyev.

Dilgam Asgarov and Shahbaz Guliyev are Azerbaijani citizens who were detained by Armenian forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Their case has been a subject of international attention, including discussions in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).

To verify this claim, we would need to find credible sources or records of Ogtay Asadov making this specific statement. Without access to such sources or records, it is challenging to definitively confirm or refute the claim.

Given the lack of specific evidence to support the claim, it is prudent to approach it with skepticism.

1. **Retirement Age in Turkey**: The claim states that nearly 80 percent of retirees are 55 and up. This is plausible as the retirement age in Turkey is generally around 58 for women and 60 for men, though there are variations based on specific conditions and reforms.

2. **Life Expectancy in Retirement in Turkey**: The claim mentions that the average life expectancy in retirement in Turkey is 17.5 years. According to various sources, including OECD data, this figure is relatively accurate, though it can vary slightly depending on the specific year and data source.

3. **OECD and European Average**: The claim states that the average life expectancy in retirement is well below the OECD and European average. According to OECD data, the average life expectancy in retirement for OECD countries is generally higher than 17.5 years, supporting this part of the claim.

4. **Life Expectancy in Retirement in France and Greece**: The claim states that the average life expectancy in retirement is 25 years in France and 24 years in Greece. According to OECD data, these figures are reasonably accurate, though they might vary slightly depending on the specific year and data source.

Given the information available, the claim appears to be largely accurate but may have slight variations depending on the specific data source and year.

Türkiye is the best country in Europe in terms of mortality rate according to the total number of patients,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye is the best country in Europe in terms of mortality rate according to the total number of patients,"" we need to consider the most recent and reliable data on mortality rates across European countries. Mortality rate in this context typically refers to the number of deaths per a certain number of patients, often expressed as a percentage.

1. **Data Source**: Reliable sources for such data include the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and national health statistics.

2. **Comparison**: We need to compare Türkiye's mortality rate with those of other European countries. This involves looking at the number of deaths relative to the number of patients for various diseases or health conditions.

3. **Current Statistics**: As of the latest available data, Türkiye's healthcare system and outcomes can be compared to other European countries. However, without specific and up-to-date statistics, it is challenging to definitively rank Türkiye as the best.

Given the complexity and variability of health data, and without specific recent statistics to confirm the claim, it is difficult to assert that Türkiye is definitively the best in Europe in terms of mortality rate relative to the total number of patients.

"170 women were killed in Turkey due to domestic violence, and we have never heard of the situation in Germany in Germany, but even the deaf sultan hears in Turkey.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. ""170 women were killed in Turkey due to domestic violence"":
   - This part of the claim can be verified by looking at recent statistics and reports from reliable sources such as government reports, NGOs, or international organizations that track domestic violence in Turkey. If the number aligns with recent data, this part can be considered accurate.

2. ""We have never heard of the situation in Germany in Germany"":
   - This part of the claim is more subjective and harder to verify. It suggests that domestic violence in Germany is not reported or known, which is not necessarily true. Germany has its own issues with domestic violence, and there are reports and statistics available from German authorities and organizations. The visibility of these reports might vary, but it is not accurate to say that the situation is completely unheard of.

3. ""Even the deaf sultan hears in Turkey"":
   - This is a figurative expression implying that the issue of domestic violence in Turkey is widely known and acknowledged. While it is true that domestic violence in Turkey has received significant attention, especially in recent years, the expression is subjective and rhetorical.

Given the mixed nature of the claim, with some parts being verifiable and others being subjective or rhetorical, the overall accuracy of the claim is not straightforward.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"Now, Türkiye is a net exporter in agriculture, is not importer.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Now, Türkiye is a net exporter in agriculture, is not importer,"" we need to look at the most recent data on Türkiye's agricultural trade balance.

A net exporter means that the country exports more agricultural products than it imports. Conversely, a net importer means that the country imports more agricultural products than it exports.

According to the latest available data from sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and trade statistics from Türkiye's Ministry of Trade, Türkiye has historically been a significant exporter of various agricultural products, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains. However, Türkiye also imports a substantial amount of agricultural products, such as certain grains, oilseeds, and animal feed.

The trade balance can fluctuate year by year based on various factors, including domestic production, global market conditions, and trade policies. As of the most recent data, Türkiye has been close to balancing its agricultural imports and exports, but it is not definitively a net exporter in all categories of agriculture.

Given this context, the claim that Türkiye is a net exporter and not an importer is an oversimplification. While Türkiye does export a significant amount of agricultural products, it also imports a considerable amount.

"As of the end of 2013, we have a 32 billion kWh loss of energy in a total of 21 distribution zones.This is almost 15 percent of a total of 229 billion kWh gross consumption.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the calculations and the context provided.

1. **Energy Loss Calculation:**
   - The claim states a 32 billion kWh loss of energy.
   - The total gross consumption is 229 billion kWh.
   - The percentage loss is calculated as: \((32 \text{ billion kWh} / 229 \text{ billion kWh}) \times 100\).

   \[
   \frac{32}{229} \times 100 \approx 13.97\%
   \]

2. **Claim Verification:**
   - The claim states that the loss is ""almost 15 percent"" of the total gross consumption.
   - The calculated percentage is approximately 13.97%, which is close to 14%, but not quite 15%.

Given this information, the claim is close but slightly overstated.

"In 1996, the doctors' monthly salary was $ 6.5",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""In 1996, the doctors' monthly salary was $6.5,"" we need to consider the context and typical salaries for doctors during that time period. 

In 1996, the average monthly salary for doctors in the United States was significantly higher than $6.5. Salaries for medical professionals typically ranged from several thousand dollars per month, depending on their specialization, experience, and location. 

Given this information, the claim that doctors' monthly salary was $6.5 in 1996 is highly inaccurate.

Final Answer: False",false,False,False
Our courts are free,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Our courts are free,"" we need to consider various aspects of the judicial system.

1. **Access to Courts**: In many countries, individuals have the right to access the court system without paying an entry fee. This means that, in principle, anyone can file a lawsuit or defend themselves in court.

2. **Associated Costs**: However, there are often significant costs associated with using the court system. These can include:
   - Filing fees for submitting legal documents.
   - Attorney fees for legal representation.
   - Costs for obtaining necessary documents or evidence.
   - Potential costs for expert witnesses or other specialized services.

3. **Public Defenders**: In criminal cases, individuals who cannot afford an attorney may be provided with a public defender at no cost. However, this does not apply to civil cases, where individuals typically need to cover their own legal expenses.

4. **Waivers and Assistance**: Some jurisdictions offer fee waivers or legal aid for individuals who cannot afford the costs associated with court proceedings. This can make the courts more accessible to low-income individuals, but it does not eliminate all costs for everyone.

Given these points, the claim ""Our courts are free"" is an oversimplification. While there is no fee to simply access the court system, there are numerous costs associated with legal proceedings that can make it expensive for many people.

27 out of 100 young people do not go to school and do not work.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""27 out of 100 young people do not go to school and do not work,"" we need to look at reliable data sources such as reports from educational institutions, labor statistics, or research studies on youth employment and education.

According to data from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and other similar organizations, the percentage of young people who are neither in employment, education, nor training (often referred to as NEET) can vary significantly by country and region. For instance, in some countries, the NEET rate can be around 10-20%, while in others, it can be higher, sometimes reaching or exceeding 25%.

Given that the claim states ""27 out of 100 young people,"" this translates to 27%, which is a specific figure. While this number might be accurate for certain regions or countries, it is not universally applicable. Therefore, without specifying the region or country, the claim cannot be universally validated or invalidated.

Our Country is Known as a Developed State in The World,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Our Country is Known as a Developed State in The World,"" we need to consider several factors, including economic indicators, human development indices, and international recognition.

1. **Economic Indicators**: Developed countries typically have high GDP per capita, advanced technological infrastructure, and a diverse economy.
2. **Human Development Index (HDI)**: This includes factors like life expectancy, education, and income per capita.
3. **International Recognition**: Whether international organizations and other countries recognize the country as developed.

Without specific information about the country in question, it's challenging to make a definitive assessment. However, if we assume the country in question is widely recognized as developed by international standards (e.g., members of the OECD, high HDI ranking), the claim could be considered 'True' or 'Mostly True'. If the country is on the borderline or has significant areas of underdevelopment, it might be 'Half True' or 'Mostly False'.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"In 2002, it was protested because it was not paid at the maturity of 500 thousand deeds, now this amount increased to 1 million.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the following points:

1. In 2002, there was a protest related to the non-payment at the maturity of 500 thousand deeds.
2. The amount related to the non-payment has now increased to 1 million.

Without specific historical data or context, it is challenging to verify the exact details of the claim. However, based on the structure and the information provided, it seems to be a statement that could be fact-checked with historical financial records or news archives.

Given the lack of specific evidence to confirm or refute the claim, the most appropriate classification would be 'Half True' as it contains elements that could be partially accurate but lacks full verification.

"We are in the top 10 in the world in terms of the income we have obtained from tourism, 4 in Europe and 4 in Europe.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the rankings of the country in question in terms of tourism income both globally and within Europe. The claim states that the country is in the top 10 in the world and 4th in Europe.

1. **Global Ranking**: Check if the country is indeed in the top 10 globally for tourism income.
2. **European Ranking**: Verify if the country ranks 4th in Europe for tourism income.

If both conditions are met, the claim would be 'True'. If only one condition is met, it would be 'Half True'. If neither condition is met, it would be 'False'. If the rankings are close but not exact, it might be 'Mostly True' or 'Mostly False' depending on the proximity.

Without specific data, I cannot definitively verify the claim. However, based on the structure of the claim and the repetition of ""4 in Europe,"" it seems there might be an error or redundancy in the statement.

"Compared to Other Countries, Azerbaijan Has Allocated A large Sum of Money for the Fight Against Coronavirus",mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Compared to Other Countries, Azerbaijan Has Allocated A large Sum of Money for the Fight Against Coronavirus,"" we need to consider the following factors:

1. **Absolute Amount**: The total amount of money allocated by Azerbaijan for COVID-19 measures.
2. **Relative Amount**: The amount allocated relative to the country's GDP or per capita spending.
3. **Comparison with Other Countries**: How this allocation compares with other countries both in absolute terms and relative to their GDP or per capita spending.

Without specific data on the exact amount Azerbaijan has allocated and how it compares to other countries, it is challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, if we assume that Azerbaijan has indeed allocated a significant amount relative to its GDP or in absolute terms, we could lean towards a certain conclusion.

Given the lack of specific data in the prompt, I will base my response on the general understanding that many countries have allocated substantial funds to combat COVID-19, and Azerbaijan's allocation would need to be exceptionally high to stand out.

(About infant death rate)… Türkiye has succeeded in the OECD countries in about 30 years.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Türkiye has succeeded in the OECD countries in about 30 years"" regarding the infant death rate, we need to examine the data on infant mortality rates in Türkiye and compare it to other OECD countries over the past three decades.

1. **Historical Data**: Türkiye's infant mortality rate has significantly decreased over the past 30 years. In the early 1990s, Türkiye had one of the highest infant mortality rates among OECD countries. However, substantial improvements in healthcare, maternal care, and public health policies have led to a dramatic reduction in infant mortality rates.

2. **Current Standing**: As of recent data, Türkiye's infant mortality rate is still higher than the OECD average but has improved significantly. While it may not be among the top performers in the OECD, the progress made is notable.

3. **OECD Comparison**: The OECD average for infant mortality is quite low, with countries like Japan, Finland, and Iceland having some of the lowest rates globally. Türkiye's rate, while improved, is still not on par with these top-performing countries but is closer to the lower end of the spectrum compared to where it was 30 years ago.

Given this context, the claim that Türkiye has ""succeeded in the OECD countries in about 30 years"" can be interpreted in different ways. If ""succeeded"" means significant improvement and catching up to the lower end of the spectrum, the claim holds some truth. However, if it implies that Türkiye is now among the best in the OECD, it would be misleading.

Freedom of assembly is Completely Ensured in the Country,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Freedom of assembly is Completely Ensured in the Country,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Legal Framework**: Does the country's constitution or legal system guarantee freedom of assembly?
2. **Implementation**: Are there instances where the government restricts or suppresses assemblies, protests, or gatherings?
3. **International Standards**: How does the country's record on freedom of assembly compare to international human rights standards?

If the country in question has a strong legal framework that guarantees freedom of assembly, but there are occasional instances of suppression or restrictions, the claim might be ""Mostly True"" or ""Half True."" If there are frequent and significant restrictions, the claim might be ""Mostly False"" or ""False.""

Without specific information about the country in question, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, in many countries, while freedom of assembly is legally protected, there are often practical limitations or instances where this right is not fully upheld.

Azerbaijan has the largest fleet in the Caspian Sea,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""Azerbaijan has the largest fleet in the Caspian Sea,"" we need to consider the naval capabilities and fleet sizes of the countries bordering the Caspian Sea, which include Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, and Azerbaijan.

1. **Russia**: Russia has a significant naval presence in the Caspian Sea, with the Caspian Flotilla being one of the most powerful naval forces in the region. It includes various warships, missile boats, and support vessels.

2. **Kazakhstan**: Kazakhstan has been developing its naval capabilities but does not have a fleet as large or as advanced as Russia's.

3. **Turkmenistan**: Turkmenistan has a smaller naval force compared to Russia and has been modernizing its fleet, but it is still not as large.

4. **Iran**: Iran also maintains a considerable naval presence in the Caspian Sea, with various warships and patrol boats.

5. **Azerbaijan**: Azerbaijan has been investing in its naval forces, but its fleet is generally considered smaller and less advanced compared to Russia's and Iran's.

Given this context, it is clear that Russia has the largest and most powerful fleet in the Caspian Sea, followed by Iran. Therefore, the claim that Azerbaijan has the largest fleet in the Caspian Sea is not accurate.

"By October 1993, the Legitim President of Azerbaijan Abulfaz Elchibey was",false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to look at the historical context of Azerbaijan's presidency in 1993.

Abulfaz Elchibey was indeed the President of Azerbaijan, having been elected in June 1992. However, in June 1993, he was effectively ousted from power following a coup led by Colonel Surat Huseynov. Elchibey fled to his native village of Keleki in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Heydar Aliyev, who was the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan at the time, assumed the role of acting president and was later elected president in October 1993.

Given this context, by October 1993, Abulfaz Elchibey was no longer the acting president, although he might still have been considered the legitimate president by some, as he had not formally resigned.

"There is a support law about the farmer.He says that less than 1 %of national income should not be allocated.Our national income is now around 4.5 trillion.1 %is 45 billion, now 16 billion has been given that means that it would be given more than 29 billion, it is not given.",mostly true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, let's break down the key points:

1. **Support Law for Farmers**: The claim states that there is a law requiring less than 1% of the national income to be allocated to farmers. This implies a minimum threshold of 1% of the national income should be allocated.

2. **National Income**: The national income is stated to be around 4.5 trillion.

3. **1% of National Income**: 1% of 4.5 trillion is indeed 45 billion.

4. **Current Allocation**: The claim states that 16 billion has been given, which is less than 1% of the national income.

5. **Shortfall**: The difference between 45 billion (1% of national income) and 16 billion (current allocation) is 29 billion.

Based on these points, the claim that 1% of the national income is 45 billion and that only 16 billion has been allocated, leaving a shortfall of 29 billion, is mathematically correct. However, the accuracy of the claim also depends on the existence and specifics of the support law mentioned, which is not verified in the provided information.

"The number of people reached by NGOs that provide education, culture, sports, art and personal development services for young people is increasing every year.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The number of people reached by NGOs that provide education, culture, sports, art and personal development services for young people is increasing every year,"" we would need to examine data and trends from multiple sources over a period of time. This would include reports from NGOs, research studies, and statistics from relevant organizations.

However, without specific data or sources to verify this claim, it is challenging to definitively categorize it. Generally, many NGOs report growth in their outreach efforts due to increased funding, awareness, and technological advancements, but this is not universally true for all NGOs or in all regions.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most accurate categorization based on general trends and the need for more precise information would be:

"... In the last twelve years, the number of TİKA Overseas Office has been increased from 12 to 49.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the number of TİKA Overseas Offices twelve years ago and compare it to the current number. TİKA (Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency) is known for its international development and cooperation efforts, and it has been expanding its presence globally.

As of the latest available data, TİKA had significantly increased its number of overseas offices over the past decade. In 2010, TİKA had around 12 offices, and by recent counts, it has expanded to approximately 49 offices worldwide.

Given this information, the claim that the number of TİKA Overseas Offices has increased from 12 to 49 in the last twelve years appears to be accurate.

Partly True / Misleading,half true,az,"To determine the appropriate label for the claim 'Partly True / Misleading,' we need to understand the definitions of each possible label:

- **True**: The claim is accurate and there are no significant inaccuracies.
- **Mostly True**: The claim is mostly accurate but may have minor inaccuracies.
- **Half True**: The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
- **Mostly False**: The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
- **False**: The claim is not accurate.

Given that 'Partly True / Misleading' suggests that the claim has some elements of truth but is presented in a way that could mislead or omit important context, the most fitting label would be 'Half True.'

"In 2002, 16 workers lost their lives in 100 thousand workers, while we came to 6 deaths from 100 thousand workers.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify the statistics regarding worker fatalities in 2002 and the current year. The claim states that in 2002, there were 16 worker deaths per 100,000 workers, and this number has decreased to 6 deaths per 100,000 workers.

1. **Historical Data Verification (2002):**
   - According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the fatal work injury rate in 2002 was approximately 4.0 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers. This is significantly lower than the claimed 16 deaths per 100,000 workers.

2. **Current Data Verification:**
   - The most recent data from the BLS (as of 2021) indicates that the fatal work injury rate is around 3.6 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers. This is also lower than the claimed 6 deaths per 100,000 workers.

Given this information, the claim does not align with the verified statistics from the BLS. The numbers provided in the claim are significantly higher than the actual reported rates.

Imam Hatipli students are not only quantitative but also qualitatively.,mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim ""Imam Hatipli students are not only quantitative but also qualitatively,"" we need to break down the statement and understand its components.

1. **Quantitative Aspect**: This likely refers to the measurable aspects of students, such as their numbers, grades, test scores, and other statistical data.
2. **Qualitative Aspect**: This refers to the non-measurable aspects, such as the quality of education, personal development, critical thinking skills, moral values, and other subjective attributes.

The claim suggests that Imam Hatipli students possess both measurable (quantitative) and non-measurable (qualitative) attributes. 

Given that all students, regardless of their educational background, inherently possess both quantitative and qualitative attributes, the statement is making a general observation that can be applied to any group of students. Therefore, it is not making a specific or unique claim about Imam Hatipli students that would be subject to verification or falsification.

"Our sapling production, which was about 117 million in 2002, rose to 401 million.It was 333 million in 2015.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim regarding sapling production, we need to verify the specific figures mentioned for the years 2002, 2015, and the unspecified year when it reached 401 million. 

1. **2002**: The claim states that sapling production was about 117 million.
2. **2015**: The claim states that sapling production was 333 million.
3. **Unspecified Year**: The claim states that sapling production rose to 401 million at some point.

"No party in Turkey, including the AK Party, did not attempt to download the dam, only the AK Party called for it to discuss it",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, let's break it down:

1. ""No party in Turkey, including the AK Party, did not attempt to download the dam"" - This is a double negative, which means it actually states that all parties, including the AK Party, did attempt to download the dam.

2. ""only the AK Party called for it to discuss it"" - This part claims that only the AK Party called for a discussion about the dam.

Given the double negative in the first part, the claim is contradictory. If no party, including the AK Party, did not attempt to download the dam, it implies that all parties did attempt to download the dam. However, the second part states that only the AK Party called for a discussion, which conflicts with the first part.

Therefore, the claim is logically inconsistent and cannot be true as stated.

We increased the employment figure to 29 million by providing 9 million new people to 9 million people during our governments.,mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into its components and verify each part:

1. **Employment Figure Increase**: The claim states that the employment figure was increased to 29 million.
2. **Provision of Employment**: The claim also states that 9 million new people were provided employment.

For the claim to be 'True', both components must be accurate. 

- **Verification of Employment Figure**: We need to check if the employment figure indeed reached 29 million during the tenure of the government in question.
- **Verification of New Employment**: We need to verify if 9 million new jobs were created during the same period.

Without specific data or context about the country, time period, and government in question, it's challenging to verify these numbers precisely. However, the structure of the sentence seems to have a redundancy or error (""providing 9 million new people to 9 million people""), which might indicate a misstatement or confusion in the claim itself.

Given the potential error in the statement and the lack of specific data to verify the numbers, the claim appears to be problematic.

Our economy has decreased by only 2.7% in six months,mostly true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Our economy has decreased by only 2.7% in six months,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Source of Data**: The claim should be based on reliable economic data, such as GDP figures from a credible institution (e.g., government statistical agencies, central banks, or international organizations like the IMF or World Bank).

2. **Time Frame**: The six-month period should be clearly defined. For instance, are we talking about the first half of the current year, the last six months, or another specific six-month period?

3. **Context**: The context in which the claim is made is important. For example, a 2.7% decrease might be considered minor or significant depending on the historical performance of the economy and external factors (e.g., global economic conditions, pandemics, etc.).

Without specific data and context, it's challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is based on accurate and recent data from a reliable source, we can make an educated assessment.

Given the lack of specific data and context in the question, the most balanced approach would be to consider the claim as ""Half True."" This acknowledges that the claim could be accurate but also leaves room for the possibility that it might not fully represent the situation without additional context.

"Erdogan period received the external debt, I paid I paid the IMF debt to 12.",mostly true,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to break it down into two parts: the external debt and the IMF debt.

1. **External Debt**: 
   - When Recep Tayyip Erdoğan came to power in 2003, Turkey's external debt was significant. Over the years, Turkey's external debt has fluctuated, and it has not been completely paid off. In fact, Turkey's external debt has generally increased over the years.

2. **IMF Debt**:
   - Turkey did indeed pay off its debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during Erdoğan's tenure. The final payment was made in 2013, which cleared Turkey's debt to the IMF.

Given these points:
- The claim about paying off the IMF debt is accurate.
- The claim about paying off the external debt is not accurate, as Turkey's external debt has not been fully paid off and has actually increased.

The Dependence of The Azerbaijani Economy On Oil Prices Has Sharply Decreased,mostly false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The Dependence of The Azerbaijani Economy On Oil Prices Has Sharply Decreased,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Economic Diversification Efforts**: Azerbaijan has made efforts to diversify its economy away from oil and gas. This includes investments in sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and information technology.

2. **Economic Indicators**: We should look at the contribution of oil and gas to Azerbaijan's GDP, government revenues, and exports over recent years. A significant decrease in these contributions would support the claim.

3. **Government Policies**: The Azerbaijani government has implemented policies aimed at reducing dependence on oil, such as the Strategic Roadmap for the National Economy and the development of non-oil sectors.

4. **External Reports and Analyses**: Reports from international organizations like the World Bank, IMF, and other economic analyses can provide insights into the current state of Azerbaijan's economic dependence on oil.

Based on available information up to 2023, Azerbaijan has indeed made strides in diversifying its economy, but oil and gas still play a significant role. The non-oil sector has grown, but the country remains vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices.

**Conclusion**: While there has been progress, the dependence on oil has not ""sharply"" decreased to the extent that the economy is no longer significantly affected by oil prices.

"Since 2003, the total number of unemployed since the beginning of this power is more than 2 million.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Time Frame**: The claim refers to the period starting from 2003.
2. **Context**: The phrase ""since the beginning of this power"" likely refers to a specific administration or government that took power in 2003.
3. **Data**: We need to verify unemployment statistics from 2003 onwards.

Without specific data on the number of unemployed individuals from 2003 to the present, it's challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the claim is about the cumulative number of unemployed individuals over the years, it is plausible that the total number of unemployed individuals over a span of 20 years could exceed 2 million, especially in a country with a large population.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, but considering the general plausibility of the claim over a long period, the most appropriate response would be:

Türkiye is the first country in Europe in agriculture.We are the 7th in the first world in Europe in agricultural growth in GDP.,mostly false,tr,"To evaluate the claim, we need to look at the most recent and reliable data on agricultural production and GDP contributions from various sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Bank, and other relevant agricultural and economic reports.

1. **Türkiye's Position in Europe in Agriculture**:
   - Türkiye is indeed one of the leading countries in Europe in terms of agricultural production. It is known for its diverse agricultural output and significant contribution to the agricultural sector in Europe. However, whether it is the ""first"" can be debated as other countries like France, Italy, and Spain also have substantial agricultural sectors.

2. **Türkiye's Global Position in Agricultural GDP Growth**:
   - According to various reports, Türkiye is often ranked among the top countries globally in terms of agricultural production and growth. However, specific rankings can vary year by year and depend on the metrics used (e.g., total production, growth rate, contribution to GDP).

Given the information, the claim that Türkiye is the ""first country in Europe in agriculture"" is somewhat exaggerated, as it is one of the top countries but not definitively the first. The claim about being the ""7th in the first world in Europe in agricultural growth in GDP"" is also somewhat ambiguous and lacks precise context.

This typically involves checking official records or statements from relevant authorities, such as the aviation department or government announcements.

Without specific data or context, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is about the increase in the number of operational airports in a particular country or region, and if there is evidence supporting that the number of operational airports has indeed doubled from 26 to 52, then the claim would be accurate.

Given the lack of specific data in the question, I cannot verify the claim's accuracy. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer.

As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, the Milli Majlis of Azerbaijan has several standing committees, and the representation of opposition parties within these committees can vary based on the political landscape and parliamentary decisions.

Given that I do not have real-time access to the latest specific details about the committee compositions, I cannot definitively confirm or refute the exact number of committees with opposition party representation. However, if the claim is based on recent and accurate information, it could be plausible.

The claim states that the rate was 27.9 percent in 2002 and increased to 33.6 percent in 2014.

1. **Labor Force Participation Rate in 2002**: 
   - According to various sources, including data from the World Bank and other labor statistics databases, the labor force participation rate for women in many countries around 2002 was indeed around 27.9 percent. However, this can vary significantly by country.

2. **Labor Force Participation Rate in 2014**: 
   - Similarly, data from 2014 shows that in many countries, the labor force participation rate for women increased, and a rate of 33.6 percent is plausible for some countries.

Given that the claim does not specify a particular country, and considering that the provided rates are within a reasonable range for many countries during those years, the claim appears to be generally accurate.

1. **International Observers' Reports**: Various international organizations, such as the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe), often monitor elections and provide reports on their fairness and adherence to democratic standards. Historically, reports on elections in Azerbaijan have frequently highlighted issues such as restrictions on political freedoms, media bias, and irregularities in the voting process.

2. **Political Freedom**: Azerbaijan has been criticized for its lack of political freedom, with reports of opposition parties facing significant obstacles, including harassment and imprisonment of political activists.

3. **Media Environment**: The media environment in Azerbaijan is often described as restrictive, with limited access to independent news sources and significant government control over major media outlets.

Given these points, while there may be some elements of democratic processes in place, significant concerns have been raised about the overall democratic nature of the elections in Azerbaijan.

"The labor force participation rate of women, which was 31.6 percent in November 2015, is less than half of the labor force participation rate of men.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to compare the labor force participation rates of women and men in November 2015.

1. The claim states that the labor force participation rate of women was 31.6 percent in November 2015.
2. It also claims that this rate is less than half of the labor force participation rate of men.

First, let's verify the labor force participation rate of women in November 2015. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the labor force participation rate for women in November 2015 was approximately 56.7 percent, not 31.6 percent.

Next, let's consider the labor force participation rate of men in November 2015. The BLS data indicates that the labor force participation rate for men in November 2015 was approximately 69.1 percent.

Now, let's compare the two rates:
- The labor force participation rate for women was 56.7 percent.
- The labor force participation rate for men was 69.1 percent.

To check if the women's rate is less than half of the men's rate:
- Half of the men's rate (69.1 percent) would be approximately 34.55 percent.

Since 56.7 percent (women's rate) is significantly higher than 34.55 percent (half of men's rate), the claim that the women's rate is less than half of the men's rate is incorrect.

"In electricity generation, one of the renewable energy sources, we have left behind many countries, especially Europe, with an increase of 31 percent.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Current Data on Renewable Energy Generation**: We need to look at the most recent statistics on renewable energy generation for the country in question and compare it to European countries.

2. **Percentage Increase**: The claim mentions a 31 percent increase. We need to verify if this percentage increase is accurate and over what time period it applies.

3. **Comparison with Europe**: The claim states that the country has ""left behind many countries, especially Europe."" This requires a comparative analysis to see if the country in question has indeed surpassed many European countries in renewable energy generation.

Without specific data and context, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, based on general trends and available data up to 2023, European countries have been leaders in renewable energy adoption, with significant investments in wind, solar, and other renewable sources. 

Given the lack of specific data to support the claim and the strong renewable energy performance of many European countries, the claim seems exaggerated.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Our foreign exchange reserves are more than total domestic product,true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Our foreign exchange reserves are more than total domestic product,"" we need to compare the foreign exchange reserves of a country with its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Foreign exchange reserves are assets held by a central bank in foreign currencies, which can include foreign banknotes, deposits, bonds, treasury bills, and other government securities. GDP, on the other hand, is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country over a specific period, usually a year.

For most countries, foreign exchange reserves are significantly smaller than their GDP. For example, as of recent data:

- The United States has foreign exchange reserves of approximately $40 billion, while its GDP is over $20 trillion.
- China has one of the largest foreign exchange reserves, around $3 trillion, but its GDP is over $14 trillion.
- India has foreign exchange reserves of around $600 billion, while its GDP is over $2.8 trillion.

Given these examples, it is highly unlikely for a country's foreign exchange reserves to exceed its GDP. Therefore, the claim is generally not true for most countries.

Claims for the decision of the BK Parliament on Nagorno-Karabakh,false,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""Claims for the decision of the BK Parliament on Nagorno-Karabakh,"" we need to verify several aspects:

1. **Existence of the BK Parliament**: There is no widely recognized legislative body known as the ""BK Parliament"" in relation to Nagorno-Karabakh. The primary legislative bodies involved in decisions about Nagorno-Karabakh are the parliaments of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the self-declared Republic of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh).

2. **Context of the Decision**: Without specific details about the decision being referred to, it is challenging to assess the claim's accuracy. However, the lack of recognition of a ""BK Parliament"" casts significant doubt on the claim's validity.

Given the absence of a known ""BK Parliament"" and the lack of context or specificity about the decision, the claim appears to be unfounded.

"In our youth, one in 10 people could enter the university, no more exposed.",false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In our youth, one in 10 people could enter the university, no more exposed,"" we need to consider historical data on university enrollment rates. 

Historically, university enrollment rates have varied significantly by country, time period, and socio-economic factors. For example, in many Western countries during the mid-20th century, university enrollment rates were indeed much lower than they are today. However, the specific figure of ""one in 10"" (or 10%) is a generalization and may not accurately reflect the situation in all regions or time periods.

Given that the claim is somewhat vague and lacks specific context, it is difficult to definitively categorize it as entirely true or false. However, it is reasonable to say that university enrollment rates were lower in the past compared to today, but the exact figure of 10% may not be universally accurate.

The growth rate of 1939-2002 clusters is 263.1 %.The average growth rate of these 64 years is 4.1.The growth rate of the AK Party governments with the clums is 54.6 %and the average is 4.9 %.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break down the provided information and verify it against historical data.

1. **Growth Rate from 1939-2002**:
   - The claim states a total growth rate of 263.1% over 64 years.
   - To find the average annual growth rate, we can use the formula for compound annual growth rate (CAGR):
     \[
     \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{\text{Number of Years}}} - 1
     \]
   - If we assume the beginning value is 100 (for simplicity), the ending value would be 363.1 (since 263.1% growth means the value increased by 263.1% of the original 100).
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{363.1}{100} \right)^{\frac{1}{64}} - 1 \approx 0.0205 \text{ or } 2.05\%
     \]
   - The claim states the average growth rate is 4.1%, which is significantly higher than the calculated 2.05%.

2. **Growth Rate of AK Party Governments**:
   - The claim states a total growth rate of 54.6% with an average of 4.9%.
   - If we assume the AK Party has been in power since 2002, that gives us approximately 20 years up to 2022.
   - Using the same CAGR formula:
     \[
     \text{CAGR} = \left( \frac{154.6}{100} \right)^{\frac{1}{20}} - 1 \approx 0.022 \text{ or } 2.2\%
     \]
   - The claim states the average growth rate is 4.9%, which again is significantly higher than the calculated 2.2%.

Given these calculations, the provided growth rates and averages do not align with the historical data and the mathematical calculations.

The Central Bank always explains the end -year forecasts of inflation.I have never seen that the Central Bank has announced the inflation rate announced.,half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to break it down into two parts:

1. ""The Central Bank always explains the end-year forecasts of inflation.""
2. ""I have never seen that the Central Bank has announced the inflation rate announced.""

For the first part, central banks typically do provide forecasts and explanations for inflation as part of their monetary policy communications. This is a common practice to maintain transparency and manage expectations.

For the second part, the statement is somewhat unclear. If it means that the Central Bank does not announce the actual inflation rate, this is incorrect. Central banks usually do announce actual inflation rates as part of their regular economic reporting.

Given these points, the claim seems to mix accurate information with a misunderstanding or misstatement about the Central Bank's practices.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
Türkiye rose to the 11th place in the world and 5th in Europe.THY has become the second largest company in Europe.,mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. Türkiye's ranking in the world and Europe.
2. Turkish Airlines (THY) being the second largest company in Europe.

1. **Türkiye's Ranking:**
   - The claim states that Türkiye is 11th in the world and 5th in Europe. This could refer to various metrics such as GDP, population, military strength, etc. Without a specific metric, it's challenging to verify this claim accurately. However, as of recent data, Türkiye is not 11th in the world by GDP (it ranks around 20th) and not 5th in Europe by GDP either.

2. **Turkish Airlines (THY) Ranking:**
   - Turkish Airlines is indeed one of the largest airlines in Europe. According to various industry reports, it has been ranked among the top airlines in Europe by passenger numbers and fleet size. However, it is typically not ranked as the second largest; it is often behind airlines like Lufthansa and Air France-KLM.

Given the lack of specificity and the discrepancies in the rankings, the claim appears to be exaggerated or inaccurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"In 2014, the number of women's murders was 281 and 160 in the first 6.5 months of 2015.",mostly true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we would need to verify the specific statistics regarding women's murders for the years 2014 and the first 6.5 months of 2015. This would typically involve consulting reliable sources such as government crime reports, law enforcement databases, or reputable research organizations that track such data.

Without access to these specific sources or data, it is not possible to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the data provided is accurate based on the context given, we can evaluate the claim as follows:

- The claim states that there were 281 women's murders in 2014.
- The claim also states that there were 160 women's murders in the first 6.5 months of 2015.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute these numbers, we can only assess the claim based on the information provided.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
The most favorable mortgage loans apply to the citizen,half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""The most favorable mortgage loans apply to the citizen,"" we need to consider several factors:

1. **Definition of ""Most Favorable""**: This term is subjective and can vary based on interest rates, loan terms, fees, and other conditions. What is favorable for one person might not be for another.

2. **Eligibility Criteria**: Mortgage loans often have specific eligibility criteria, such as credit score, income level, and employment history. Not all citizens may qualify for the most favorable terms.

3. **Market Variability**: Mortgage loan terms can vary widely based on the lender, the economic environment, and government policies. Some citizens might have access to better terms due to these factors.

4. **Government Programs**: In some countries, government programs may offer more favorable mortgage terms to certain groups of citizens, such as first-time homebuyers or veterans.

Given these considerations, the claim is overly broad and does not account for the variability in individual circumstances and market conditions. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate to say that the most favorable mortgage loans apply universally to all citizens.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"In 2017, 1 billion 322 million people traveled around the world, Turkey ranks 6th in the ranking of countries attracting the most tourists in 2017.",half true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The total number of international travelers in 2017.
2. Turkey's ranking in terms of attracting the most tourists in 2017.

According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the number of international tourist arrivals worldwide in 2017 was approximately 1.323 billion. This aligns closely with the claim of 1 billion 322 million people.

Regarding Turkey's ranking, the UNWTO reported that Turkey was indeed the 6th most visited country in 2017, attracting around 37.6 million international tourists.

Both parts of the claim are accurate based on the available data.

Final Answer: True",true,False,False
"In 12 years, we provided 70 billion pounds cash grant support to our producers.",true,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim ""In 12 years, we provided 70 billion pounds cash grant support to our producers,"" we need to verify the following:

1. The time frame of 12 years.
2. The total amount of cash grant support provided, which is claimed to be 70 billion pounds.
3. The recipients of the support, which are specified as ""our producers.""

Without specific data or sources to verify these points, it is challenging to definitively categorize the claim. However, if we assume the claim is made by a credible organization and there is no immediate evidence to the contrary, we might lean towards a cautious assessment.

Given the lack of specific data to confirm or refute the claim, the most balanced approach would be to consider it as ""Half True,"" acknowledging that while the claim could be accurate, we do not have sufficient evidence to fully verify it.

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
"The salary of doctors serving ""COVID"" has been increased by 3-5 times",half true,az,"To determine the accuracy of the claim that ""The salary of doctors serving 'COVID' has been increased by 3-5 times,"" we need to consider the context and available evidence.

1. **Context**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and regions implemented various measures to support healthcare workers, including financial incentives. However, the extent of these measures varied widely.

2. **Evidence**:
   - In some countries, there were reports of significant bonuses or hazard pay for healthcare workers, including doctors, who were directly involved in treating COVID-19 patients. These bonuses could sometimes be substantial, but they were not necessarily a 3-5 times increase in base salary.
   - In other regions, the financial support was more modest, and there were even reports of healthcare workers not receiving any additional compensation.

3. **Variability**: The claim might be true in specific instances or regions but is not universally applicable. The increase in compensation for doctors serving COVID-19 patients was not uniformly 3-5 times their regular salary across all countries or regions.

Given the variability and lack of consistent evidence supporting a universal 3-5 times increase in salary for doctors serving COVID-19 patients, the claim cannot be considered fully accurate.

Final Answer: Mostly False",mostly false,False,False
"Remember before 2002.A damaging PTT ... Today, our PTT General Directorate makes a profit of around 200 million pounds per year.",mostly false,tr,"To determine the accuracy of the claim, we need to verify two main points:

1. The financial status of the PTT (Post and Telegraph Organization) before 2002.
2. The current profitability of the PTT General Directorate, specifically whether it makes a profit of around 200 million pounds per year.

Without specific financial records or credible sources to confirm these details, it is challenging to definitively verify the claim. However, if we assume the statement is based on accurate historical and current financial data, we can make an educated guess.

Given the lack of concrete evidence provided in the question, the claim cannot be fully verified or refuted. Therefore, the most appropriate classification would be:

Final Answer: Half True",half true,False,False
